Born in Nottingham to John H Skelton and Dorothy (n\u00e9e Bromley), he provided the voices for many characters on British television for nearly fifty years, particularly the characters of both Zippy and George on Rainbow, which the actor first joined in the early 1970s and performed on until it was axed in 1991. However, due to the fame of the characters, he continued to voice Zippy and George in guest appearances on television in series such as The Weakest Link and TV Burp until his death.\nAs well as providing the iconic Rainbow voices, Skelton also voiced several Doctor Who villains including the Daleks, Cybermen and the Krotons. He started performing the Daleks in 1967 (continuing the role from fellow voice actor Peter Hawkins whom he also replaced as Zippy on Rainbow) and notably performed in the Doctor Who specials The Five Doctors and The Curse of Fatal Death.\nIn 2002, he guest-starred in Sarah Jane Smith: Test Of Nerve, an audio drama produced by Big Finish Productions. In February 2008, he appeared as both Zippy and George in the first episode of the BBC One series Ashes to Ashes.\nSkelton died at his home in Brighton, East Sussex, on 8 June 2011, after suffering a stroke less than 2 months before his 80th birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dalek", "response": ["Besides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included Roy Skelton, who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story The Evil of the Daleks and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including Planet of the Daleks,Planet of the Daleks.

Most notable amongst the many connections between \"old\" and \"new\" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised Doctor Who script by Steven Moffat, the first post-production work of The Mill on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between Verity Lambert and Susie Liggat, and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, Roy Skelton. Executive Producer Richard Curtis would later write the 2010 episode \"Vincent and the Doctor\". Richard E. Grant, who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor would later appear on the actual show, as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the Great Intelligence, after performing the voice of an alternate version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial Scream of the Shalka.", "* Roy Skelton had voiced Daleks since 1967."]}, {"page": "Genesis of the Daleks", "response": ["The character of Davros was designed by Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a \"spokesperson\" for the Daleks as he felt it was \"boring\" listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with a small body and a large \"green, dome-like head\" which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive.  The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the \"disorienting\" situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes in the top of the bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue. Stuntman and actor Terry Walsh appeared uncredited in several roles."]}, {"page": "Mock Turtle", "response": ["* The Mock Turtle appears in Alice in Wonderland (1986) (TV) played by Roy Skelton."]}, {"page": "Rainbow (TV series)", "response": ["The second season of the show in 1973 brought in some notable changes - the character of Duffy was replaced by George the Hippo, a shy pink hippo friend of Zippy's who would crouch behind the window sill, only rarely coming into full view, and was so shy that he rarely spoke, preferring to make funny noises rather than speak. Zippy was now voiced by Roy Skelton, who also voiced George (albeit in a different, deeper-toned style from the later characteristic George voice), with Zippy now operated by John Thirtle and George by Valerie Heberden. Bungle's appearance was also changed significantly with a completely different head design, and the show's title sequence was changed though the theme tune remained the same; the new title sequence was used for the rest of the show's run.", "The format of the show was significantly built upon during this era. The scripts began to move beyond the educational format of the show and focus more on actual storylines, driven by character comedy rather than educational themes. The puppets were portrayed more like actual children, albeit exaggerated for comedy effect, with Zippy the loud and mischievous one, Bungle the tell-tale conformist, and George the shy, timid character caught between them. Geoffrey's character moved beyond the simple role of presenter to be more of a realistic parent figure, often becoming exasperated and harried by the antics of the three puppets, occasionally showing a grumpy side or losing his temper. As the show moved increasingly into sitcom territory, Rod, Jane & Freddy's roles increased vastly, involved more heavily in the storylines instead of just singing the song. More of the Rainbow House was shown instead of just the living room, with the bedrooms, kitchen, garden and occasionally additional rooms shown frequently. As the show increased in popularity, more celebrity guests began to feature, usually to read a story from the Rainbow book or help with the song. Another common theme for episodes around this time involved the cast acting out a well-known fairytale, such as Rumplestiltskin, The Ugly Duckling or The Hare and the Tortoise. Various guest characters were introduced who would make the occasional recurring appearances, most notably 'Aunty' played by Patsy Rowlands, and Zippy's cousin Zippo (voiced by Roy Skelton and usually operated by Valerie Heberden).", "At this time, more of the episodes were written by the cast members themselves, with Roy Skelton, Stanley Bates, Geoffrey Hayes and Freddy Marks all contributing a significant number of episodes to the show. A special 1,000th episode was screened in October 1986 around the time the show celebrated its 14th birthday, featuring a whole load of child viewers of the show joining the cast for a party, with Matthew Corbett and Sooty appearing as guest characters, alongside Christopher Lillicrap.", "Following the nationwide newspaper campaign to bring Rainbow back on air, a reboot of the show was announced by Tetra Films in late 1993 and debuted on Children's ITV in February 1994. The reboot of the show reworked the format enormously as well as replacing nearly all of the cast members. Geoffrey's presenter role was scrapped altogether and the show instead focused on the characters of Zippy, George and Bungle, now independent of Geoffrey, running a toy shop for an unseen boss called Mr Top. Bungle's appearance was changed radically and he was now played by Richard Robinson, and in the absence of a presenter figure, served a kind of parent role towards Zippy and George whilst retaining his blundering, clumsy nature. Zippy and George's puppets were redesigned more subtly but Roy Skelton no longer voiced them; their voices now provided by their puppeteers - Ronnie Le Drew, the only member of the original show's cast still on board, voiced and operated Zippy, while George was operated and voiced by Craig Crane. Their personalities were also altered slightly, with George no longer shy but instead confident and assertive, with Zippy consequently forced into more of a self-pitying, submissive role although retaining his boastful nature. An additional puppet character was also introduced in the form of Cleo, a blue female rabbit voiced and operated by Gillian Robic. Cleo's role was unclear, with some episodes portraying her as a mere customer to the shop, others as a nosy neighbour and others as a playmate for Zippy and George. The theme tune and the opening sequence was changed altogether. The new format was not well received at all by either children or adults, and the show received overwhelmingly negative reviews in the newspapers; its lack of popularity was reflected in poor viewing figures.", "In 1996, GMTV ordered a 26-part series, Mole in the Hole, for its weekend morning children's strand. Produced by AMG Productions, a division of the Artist Management Group,ComedyKings.co.uk, summer 1996 the GMTV series was essentially Geoffrey Hayes, Roy Skelton and Malcolm Lord's own attempt to reboot Rainbow, having been left out of the Tetra Films revivals. Set in the fictional village of Codswallop, Mole in the Hole featured Geoffrey Hayes as lead presenter, living in a country cottage with three puppet characters - a large mole called Norman (played by Malcolm Lord in a bodysuit), a dog called Freddie and a cat called Fifi (both voiced by Roy Skelton). Respectively, these characters had strongly similar voices and personalities to Bungle, Zippy and George. While the format was strikingly similar to that of Rainbow, the puppet characters had more independence of Geoffrey, such as driving out in the countryside by themselves and had more mature knowledge, including knowledge of Shakespeare's plays. Most episodes would end with the cast performing a song together.\"Mole in the Hole\" on YouTube The series lasted for one season of 26 episodes. Following its GMTV transmission, the series was repeated as part of the Tiny Living block on LivingTV.", "In the early 2000s, Rainbow saw a revival of sorts among the student disco circuit, after a huge amount of Rainbow merchandise began to appear in shops and proved extremely popular with students who had grown up with the original TV series. The cast of Geoffrey Hayes, Roy Skelton, Malcolm Lord and Ronnie Le Drew reunited for the Rainbow Disco Roadshow, which would go on to tour university campuses and student discos for the bulk of the 00s. The shows consisted of Zippy assuming the role of 'Superstar DJ' and a stage show in which Geoffrey would invite members of the audience onstage to participate in a quiz with the characters of Zippy, Bungle and George, before joining students on the dancefloor.", "Although Roy Skelton and Geoffrey Hayes died in 2011 and 2018 respectively, the characters of Zippy, George and Bungle still make the occasional TV appearances to the present day.", "*Zippy \u2013 loud and domineering, but usually very funny (albeit not to the other characters in the show).

Zippy's mouth is a zip, and when he became too bossy or irritating, this was zipped shut to prevent him from continuing: on at least one occasion he unzipped himself, though he appears unable to do so on other occasions. He broadly represented childhood self-centeredness, \"naughtiness\" and extroversion. Zippy was extremely boastful and would frequently brag about his superior intelligence and singing skill (both of which proved to be completely unfounded when put to the test) and was also greedy, often overeating and displaying a particular love for chocolate and sweets.", "*George \u2013 a shy, pink and slightly camp hippo. He broadly represented sensitivity and introversion. (puppet; voiced by Roy Skelton and operated by Malcolm Lord, Tony Holtham and later Craig Crane).  George first appeared in 1973, introduced as a shy friend of Zippy's who was afraid of being seen or heard, usually crouching very low behind the window pane and rarely speaking, preferring to make funny noises. In subsequent seasons George gradually became more extroverted and spoke more, though he remained predominantly shy and timid. The most generally well-behaved and well-meaning of the puppet characters, George often found himself caught between Zippy and Bungle's squabbling, and his good nature taken advantage of by the other characters.
