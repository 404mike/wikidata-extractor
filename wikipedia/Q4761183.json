He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use.

Their run put them nine points clear at the top of the table. At the end of February, Southall was recalled, and Stoke refused to loan back Harrison as cover. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Andy Poole proved to be an inadequate replacement. Vale then lost Greenhoff to Rochdale, who offered him the vacant management post. Lol Hamlett's last match as trainer (he retired due to illness) was a 2\u20130 defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, as Vale were in danger of failing to win promotion. McGrath decided to sign striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, and loaned Mark Lawrence from Hartlepool United. Siddall returned and so did Vale's form, as they recorded five victories in seven games. Ernie Moss left for Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee, McGrath saying 'age caught up with him'. Wimbledon ran away with the championship, though Vale managed to secure promotion with a 2\u20130 win over Stockport County at Edgeley Park on 6 May.
