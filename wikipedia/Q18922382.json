Three decades later she was interviewed by Peter Wright as having been in a position to have passed information to the Soviets, and to Wright, MI5's official spy hunter, she explained her situation; Wright took no action. In fact her work as civil servant was in fields such as family policy and so would have been of no interest to the Soviets.Obituary of Jenifer Hart, Daily Telegraph, 9 April 2005. The person who recruited her, Bernard Floud, interviewed by Wright shortly after, maintained that he was unable to remember ever having done so. Nor was her husband in a position to convey to her information of use, despite vague newspaper suggestions, given the sharp separation of his work from that of foreign affairs and its focus on German spies and British turncoats rather than on matters related to the Soviet ally. In fact, Hart was anticommunist.", "The marriage contained \"incompatible personalities\", though it lasted right to the end of their lives and gave joy to both at times. Hart did joke with his daughter at one point, however, that \"[t]he trouble with this marriage is that one of us doesn't like sex and the other doesn't like food\", Margaret Howatson, Obituary: Jenifer Hart, The Independent, 31 March 2005. and according to LSE law professor Nicola Lacey, Hart was, by his own account, a 'suppressed homosexual'.

Jenifer published her memoirs under the title Ask Me No More in 1998. The Harts had four children, including, late in life, a son who was disabled, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck having deprived his brain of oxygen. The boy was, despite his handicap, capable of remarkable observations on occasion. As a philosopher, Hart had long been interested in the mind-body problem, and he was thus in some sense professionally interested in his son, as well as emotionally invested, if only because his child was first-hand proof of the complex and unpredictable nature of the relationship between mind and body."]}, {"page": "Anthony Blunt", "response": ["In 1963, MI5 learned of Blunt's espionage from an American, Michael Straight, whom he had recruited.

By the early 1950s Reed was a senior officer in MI5, and indeed was the officer to whom William Skardon, Scotland Yard's top interrogator, reported, when Skardon was questioning, and extracting a confession from, the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. By then, Reed was in charge of the section which dealt with Russian spies, and thus was intimately involved in the investigation of those who spied for Russia, in particular, Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. Reed, like all his fellow officers, had been completely hoodwinked by Philby, and as a result he might have been demoted or moved. However, he did spot that Jenifer Hart, wife of Professor H. L. A.
