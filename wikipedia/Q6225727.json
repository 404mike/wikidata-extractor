Public reaction to his Narrative took the form of subscription for the Waldensians, headed by George IV and Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, in part for the endowment of a college and library at Torre Pellice in Piedmont. On 13 May 1826 Gilly was collated to a prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral. The following year he became perpetual curate of St Margaret's Church, Durham, and in 1831 vicar of Norham, near Berwick-on-Tweed. In 1853 he was appointed canon residentiary of Durham. John Charles Beckwith decided to settle with the Waldensians."]}]}}
