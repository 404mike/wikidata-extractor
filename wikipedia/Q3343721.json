She was a teacher and a member of the Young Conservatives. They met on polling day for the Greater London Council elections in London, and became engaged after only ten days. They have two children: a daughter, Elizabeth (born November 1971) and a son, James (b. January 1975). John and Norma continue to live at their constituency home, Finings, in Great Stukeley, Huntingdonshire. The couple also own a flat in London and a holiday home on the Norfolk coast at Weybourne, which they have in the past invited ex-soldiers to use for free as part of the Afghan Heroes charity. As with all former prime ministers, Major is entitled to round-the-clock police protection."]}, {"page": "Knight", "response": ["Wives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal \"Lady\" before their husband's surname. Thus Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife was formally styled Lady McCartney (rather than Lady Paul McCartney or Lady Heather McCartney). The style Dame Heather McCartney could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame Norma Major, who gained her title six years before her husband Sir John Major was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma's husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood. Since the reign of Edward VII a clerk in holy orders in the Church of England has not normally received the accolade on being appointed to a degree of knighthood. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title \"Sir\". Ministers of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy did receive the accolade on his appointment as Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson, who was ordained just a year after he was appointed Knight Bachelor, apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace. A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a baronet is entitled to use the title Sir."]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in England and Wales", "response": ["| Dame Norma Major DBE also has a higher precedence as the wife of Sir John Major KG"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Scotland", "response": ["##Norma Major"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Northern Ireland", "response": ["##Norma Major"]}, {"page": "Joan Sutherland", "response": ["Her official biography, Joan Sutherland: The Authorised Biography, published in February 1994, was written by Norma Major, wife of the then prime minister John Major.", "Sutherland performed live the following complete roles.This list is taken from the complete list of Sutherland's performances up to and including 18 December 1986 on pp.\u00a0204\u2013241 of Norma Major's book Joan Sutherland, published 1987", "* Norma Major: Joan Sutherland: The Authorized Biography, Queen Anne Press, 1987, ,  / Little, Brown and Company, 1994, , "]}, {"page": "London South Bank University", "response": ["* Norma Major, philanthropist and wife of Sir John Major"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Whitemoor", "response": ["Whitemoor Prison was built on the site of an old railway marshalling yard and was opened in 1991 by Norma Major.
