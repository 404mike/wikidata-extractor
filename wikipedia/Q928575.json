He made his debut for Wales during the tournament in Wales' second group game, a 1\u20131 draw with Mexico in the group stages after being brought in for Cardiff teammate Derrick Sullivan. Sullivan had suffered a knee injury during Wales' opening group match against Hungary and failed a late fitness test for the following match. Baker came close to scoring in the first half of the match, hitting the crossbar with one shot after chipping Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal but was forced off the pitch in the final minutes of the game with injury during which Mexico scored a late equaliser. He did not feature again during the tournament but went on to win a total of 7 caps, making his final appearance on 8 November 1961 against Scotland."]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Derrick Sullivan"]}, {"page": "List of Cardiff City F.C. internationals", "response": ["Alf Sherwood became the club's highest capped international player following the end of the Second World War. Having made his debut for Wales in 1946, he surpassed Keenor's total and amassed 39 caps while a Cardiff player. Wales qualified for its first major international tournament at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Five Cardiff players were selected in the nation's 23-man squad for the competition: Colin Baker, Ron Hewitt, Ken Jones, Derrick Sullivan and Graham Vearncombe. Sullivan became the first Cardiff player to feature in a World Cup during Wales' opening fixture against Hungary. Baker and Hewitt also played in the competition, while goalkeepers Jones and Vearncombe remained unused reserves. In 2003, Australian defender Tony Vidmar became the first Cardiff player to represent a country from outside the British Isles. The final nation of the British Isles to have a representative from Cardiff was England, when Jay Bothroyd won a single cap in 2010. Icelandic midfielder Aron Gunnarsson overtook Sherwood to become the club's most capped international player in 2016.

Vale won 2\u20130, and their victory was aided by the fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a \u00a325,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to pay more than \u00a325,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away."]}]}}
