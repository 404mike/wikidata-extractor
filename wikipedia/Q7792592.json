He is best known for his popular and highly decorated county maps of England, steel-engraved and first published separately between 1830 and 1832.\nMoule was born in Marylebone, London.  He sold books in Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, from 1816 to 1822.  Later, he became an inspector of 'blind' (illegibly addressed) letters at the General Post Office.

This was the only book Camden wrote in English, and, contrary to his own misleading description of it in the first edition (1605) as being merely the \"rude rubble and out-cast rubbish\" of a greater and more serious work (i.e. Britannia), manuscript evidence clearly indicates that he planned this book early on and as a quite separate project. Remaines subsequently ran into many editions. The standard modern edition, edited by R. D. Dunn, is based on the surviving manuscript material and the three editions published in Camden's lifetime (1605, 1614, and 1623). Editions published after 1623 are unreliable and contain unauthentic material, especially the bowdlerized edition of 1636 by John Philipot.
