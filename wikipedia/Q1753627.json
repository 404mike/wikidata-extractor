As with the recording of his previous works, Heffes conducted the orchestra himself to enable re-scoring as the recording session proceeded. Macdonald involved moon early on in production, and in an unusual move for a studio film, he had Heffes write some of the music to State of Play in advance of principal photography, based purely upon the script. Heffes said this was to provide a hint to the direction the film was going to take. He said that he and Macdonald had decided to take the score down an unusual path, \"off the beaten track\", and that the prospect was a \"liberating\" one. Grammy Award-winning record producer \"Flood\" (aka Mark Ellis) worked with Heffes on the score. Heffes said that working with Ellis \"opened his mind\" and that they attempted to push boundaries.
