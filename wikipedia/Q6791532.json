By midnight rescuers had reached the damaged cage and George Sharp Snr was brought up in a rope sling.  However, he jammed against some overhanging timbers, came out of the sling and fell to his death.  The rescuers (including the by then rested Chapman) then descended the pump staple and lowered a rope sling from the high main.  William Shape and Ralph Robinson were brought up from the cage in this manner.  Thomas Watson, a Primitive Methodist local preacher, had earlier descended from the cage to the men who had fallen.  He remained with them to pray and comfort them until they died.  Watson likewise ascended in a sling and was therefore the last man out alive."]}, {"page": "Dunn (surname)", "response": ["*Archibald Matthias Dunn (1832\u20131917), English architect", "*Matthias Dunn (??\u20131869), English engineer"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Couch", "response": ["He trained in succession a large number of fishermen to aid him in his pursuits, and the observations made at and near Polperro during his lifetime and since his death have not been equalled in value at any British station.
