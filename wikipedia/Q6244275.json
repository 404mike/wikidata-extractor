Mr. Le Gay Brereton has set himself, we take it, to utter what emotional men feel about woman's love, their sense of restraint under the conditions of life and the hamperings of mortality, their regret about past and lost joy and past failures, their longings for a bliss to come, their vagrant fancies and their fervent hopes. There are poets who paint the life of action and who inspire men to action, but since men dream and ponder as well as act and work, he is also a poet who utters for those last what is in their minds. Mr. Le Gay Brereton's muse is undoubtedly sensuous and dreamy; she is serious if not sombre; but she sings well in her minor key. We admire in these pages the mastery of the poet over language and rhyme, which he makes his obedient instruments. Popular his little work will not be, but it will be grateful to the lovers of melodious verse, who seek soothing rather than stirring influences from poetry.\"\"Review\", The Maitland Daily Mercury, 13 April 1896, p2"]}, {"page": "An Anthology of Australian Verse", "response": ["* John Le Gay Brereton"]}, {"page": "Challis Professorship", "response": ["* John Le Gay Brereton (1921-1933)"]}, {"page": "Aussie: The Australian Soldiers' Magazine", "response": ["The magazine contained some biographical clips and works by well-known Australian writers such as 'Banjo' Paterson, Henry Lawson, C.J Dennis, Louise Mack and John Le Gay Brereton.
