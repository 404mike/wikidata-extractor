His broad scope is illustrated by the fact that he made extensive use of quantitative methods, while critically dealing with subjects of social and political relevance. Johnston authored or co-authored more than 50 books and 800 papers, and edited or co-edited a further more than 40 books (if translated and revised editions are counted separately). He edited The Dictionary of Human Geography and for the first four editions was its main editor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 30", "response": ["*  1941   \u2013 Ron Johnston, English geographer and academic (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "Quantitative revolution", "response": ["The common factor, linking the above techniques, was a preference for numbers over words and a belief that numerical work had a superior scientific pedigree.

Many geographers became increasingly concerned that these techniques simply put a highly sophisticated technical gloss on an approach to study that was barren of fundamental theory. Other critics argued that it removed the 'human dimension' from a discipline that always prided itself on studying the human and natural world alike. As the 1970s dawned, the quantitative revolution came under direct challenge. The counter-positivist response came as geographers began to expose the inadequacy of quantitative methods to explain and address issues regarding race, gender, class and war. On that regard, David Harvey disregarded earlier works where he advocated for the quantitative revolution and adopted a Marxist theoretical framework. Soon new subfields would emerge in human geography to contribute a new vocabulary for addressing these issues, most notably critical geography and feminist geography. Ron Johnston Ron Johnston (geographer) and Bristol colleagues have argued and documented how quantitative methods can be used in a critical geography.Johnston, R, et al. (2014) \"One step forward but two steps back to the proper appreciation of spatial science.\" Dialogues in Human Geography 4.1 (2014): 59-69. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261062153 One commentator described this as \"an extraordinary contribution. This is a panoramic survey of the legacy of half a century of innovation in spatial science\u2014put into a critical, constructive engagement with half a century of innovation in critical social theory\".Wyly, E. 2014.

Ron Johnston considers the entire process and outcome of the election through the examining lens of territory maps.  He claims that electoral results are the outcome of superimposing the map of cultural, economic, religious, and demographic characteristics with the determined map of electoral districts and applying the issues on the ballot.  The selection of mapping paradigms using color, patterning, brightness or darkness effects is employed in order to visually detail aspects and characteristics of interest in elections, such as voter participation, intensity of support, population density, and constituency boundaries which may not easily be noticed by considering words and numbers. An example of a mapping paradigm is observed in United States elections in recent history, wherein results in favor of Democratic candidates are marked by coloring the constituency blue and using red for results in favor of Republican candidates. This has been used to a wide degree and is thus readily acknowledged by United States citizens in the media and academic display of election results. However, the variations in electoral results over a territory or place cannot be directly equated to the land areas represented by mapping as the voting populace is the subject of interest and study in electoral geography and not the particular territory they live on during a given election.  Human movement is an ongoing progress, which consistently redefines the distributions of policy preference and thus the associated election decisions. Thus the passage of time must be incorporated in electoral analysis through the duality of Electoral geography also deals with the alterations of election results in a given place over an extended time interval encompassing many elections. This effect can be mapped using various techniques which help to show changing opinions and changing populations in the constituencies of the state over a time interval. Electoral geography relies upon detailed and accurate mapping techniques with appropriate contextualization and background knowledge in order to successfully visualize and analyze the results of an election."]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal (geography)", "response": ["*1990: Ron Johnston"]}, {"page": "Ronald John Johnston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Johnston (geographer)"]}, {"page": "Ron J.
