The 70 images were laid out in a rigid grid with one optimal \"correct\" image in the center. This changing of the mechanics of each shot revealed the intention of the unseen photographer. In 1974, Hilliard showed in Cause of Death four images of the same human body covered in a sheet. The images were taken from the same photographic negative but each one suggested a different cause of death, accomplished by cropping the print to modify context. Each image was given its own one-word title to indicate a narrative: \"Crushed\", \"Drowned\", \"Burned\", and \"Fell\". Photographer Chris Steele-Perkins wrote that, in Cause of Death, \"framing affects the way a photograph is read\", and that Hilliard provides the viewer with \"elegant forensic evidence that, although the camera cannot lie, photographs tell different truths.\" University of Ulster photography professor Terence Wright noted that Cause of Death is a formalist piece in which the process is revealed, and that many of Hilliard's works fall into this classification."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle University people", "response": ["* Chris Steele-Perkins - photographer"]}, {"page": "Chris Steele Perkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Steele-Perkins"]}, {"page": "Chris Steel Perkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Steele-Perkins"]}, {"page": "Chris Steel-Perkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Steele-Perkins"]}, {"page": "Prix Pictet", "response": ["| 2009 || Earth || Nadav Kander, Yangtze, the long river\"Nadav Kander: Yangtze, the long river\", Prix Pictet.

So while Anglo-Burman as described above might fit, I don't believe that Anglo-Burman as described on the category page would.
