(1864-1917)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Grieve", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Basil Arthur Firebrace Grieve (28 May 1864 \u2013 19 November 1917) was a cricketer who played two cricket Test matches for England during the England tour of South Africa in 1888\u201389. The games represent the first two first-class cricket games played in South Africa. \nBorn in Kilburn, Middlesex, Grieve was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was no better than a club cricketer, and was a fine medium-paced opening bowler for Harrow and the Marylebone Cricket Club. He did not bowl in the two Tests he played, and was only selected for the 1888-9 England tour after it was decided that a full-strength team would be far too strong for the Springboks. This was found to be true: though the England side was no better than that of a weak county side, it still won handsomely. \nGrieve was a wine merchant by trade. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex.", "link_mentions": {}}}
