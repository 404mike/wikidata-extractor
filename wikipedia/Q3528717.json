The games represent the first two first-class cricket games played in South Africa. \nBorn in Kilburn, Middlesex, Grieve was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was no better than a club cricketer, and was a fine medium-paced opening bowler for Harrow and the Marylebone Cricket Club. He did not bowl in the two Tests he played, and was only selected for the 1888-9 England tour after it was decided that a full-strength team would be far too strong for the Springboks. This was found to be true: though the England side was no better than that of a weak county side, it still won handsomely. \nGrieve was a wine merchant by trade. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "South Africa national cricket team", "response": ["In 1889, South Africa became the third test-playing nation when it played against England at Port Elizabeth,South Africa's debut Test match 1889 scorecard ESPNcricinfo.

However, these two matches, as was the case with all early matches involving the erstwhile 'South African XI' against all touring teams, did not receive the status of official 'Test' matches until South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference with England and Australia in 1906. Neither did the touring English team organised by Major Warton even claim to be representing the English cricket team; the matches were marketed as 'Major Warton's XI' v/s 'South African XI' instead. Even the players who participated did not know that they had played international cricket, and the side that played South Africa was regarded to be of weak county strength. The team was captained by C.A. Smith, a decent medium pacer from Sussex, and for two of the Major Warton's XI, Basil Grieve and The Honourable Charles Coventry, the two Tests constituted their entire first-class career. Even so, the nascent, fledgling 'South African XI' was very weak, losing both tests comfortably to England, English spinner Johnny Briggs claiming 15\u201328 in the second Test at Cape Town.The ignorant internationals  Martin Williamson, ESPNcricinfo. 28 November 2009.

He only took one wicket in the innings, and was noted more for his batting later in the day. Having bowled South Africa out for 84, England rallied from 103 for nine due to a 45-run partnership for the tenth wicket between Fothergill and Basil Grieve. Batting at number eleven, Fothergill scored 32 runs, second only to opening batsman Bobby Abel. In South Africa's second innings, Fothergill was used as first-change bowler, and took four wickets for 19, his best figures in the two Test matches.
