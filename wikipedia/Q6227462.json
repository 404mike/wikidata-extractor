He played over 400 times for Middlesbrough but also had spells at Newcastle United and Darlington.After 52 League appearances at Newcastle United, Middlesbrough paid a then club record \u00a360,000 fee to bring Craggs to Teesside in 1971. After a testimonial match against Newcastle United in the summer of 1982, Craggs left Middlesbrough to re-join his former club before ending his playing days at Darlington. He thereafter took up a coaching role at Hartlepool United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton took advice from Celtic manager Jock Stein, who allowed him to sign right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* John Craggs (487)"]}, {"page": "History of Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["After regaining promotion to the Second Division, Boro were on good form. They wouldn't finish below ninth during the next eight seasons. The FA Cup saw the club never get past the quarter-finals, a feat they were yet to accomplish in their history. John Hickton, converted from defence, was proving a revelation up front, while Willie Maddren made his debut in 1969, with John Craggs and Stuart Boam joining three seasons later. Jim Platt had also taken over in goal. With Graeme Souness joining soon after, the spine of the team to gain promotion to the First Division was there. Jack Charlton took over as manager and guided the team back to the top flight at last. They ensured promotion as early as 23 March, and with eight games of the season left, they became runaway champions, finishing with a record 65 points."]}, {"page": "Stan Cummins", "response": ["In 1983, after his Sunderland contract had expired, Cummins joined Crystal Palace instead of Newcastle United and Kevin Keegan, a move he deeply regrets, returning to Sunderland a year later. He had played with Keegan in John Craggs's Testimonial Match in 1982 and enjoyed Keegan's style of play. His second spell at Roker Park was short-lived. He was a member of the Sunderland Squad who got to the 1985 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium but couldn't play because he was cup-tied. In May 1985 he captained Sunderland to victory over Middlesbrough in the Final of the Bradford City Disaster Fund North East of England Six-a-Side Tournament held at Teesside Park. All of the proceeds went to Bradford City F.C. In all he made 165 appearances for Sunderland. He left the club following relegation in 1985 for the US at the age of 26 and joined the Minnesota Strikers on a three-year contract in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). The Strikers reached the 1986 MISL Championship only to lose 4 games to 3 (best of seven) to the San Diego Sockers. However, they were crowned MISL Eastern Division Champions in 1988 and on 8 April Cummins scored a hat-trick in the Strikers 4\u20132 victory against the Chicago Sting and he was carried shoulder high from the playing field by his teammates at the end of the game. The club folded at the end of the season and so Cummins joined the Kansas City Comets for the 1988/89 season. He played in all of the Comets games that season along with teammate Greg Ion. An entertaining and skilful player, Cummins' career spanned 14 years, 10 years in the English Football League where he made 251 appearances in both League and Cup Competitions scoring 50 goals, 2 seasons in the NASL and 4 years in the MISL, USA. He retired as a professional player in 1990 and has a UEFA 'B' coaching certificate."]}, {"page": "Craggs", "response": ["* John Craggs (songwriter) (1849\u2013?), English poet", "* John Craggs (footballer) (born 1948), English footballer"]}, {"page": "John Craggs", "response": ["John Craggs may refer to:", "* John Craggs (songwriter) (1849\u2013?), poet from North Sunderland ", "* John Craggs (footballer) (born 1948), retired footballer for Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Darlington"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1970s)", "response": ["!scope=row|John Craggs"]}]}}
