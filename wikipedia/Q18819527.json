Dyce, A Few Notes on Shakespeare: with Occasional Remarks on the Emendations of the Manuscript-Corrector in Mr Collier's Copy of the Folio 1632 (John Russell Smith, London 1853), (Internet Archive). The authenticity of the whole, however, was roundly rejected, on internal evidence, by S. W. Singer in The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated (1853).S.W. Singer, The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated from the Interpolations and Corruptions Advocated by John Payne Collier in his Notes and Emendations (Pickering, London 1853), (Internet Archive). In 1853 J.O. Halliwell showed the Dulwich letter to have been (at best) misinterpreted by Collier, and stated (with the owner's permission) his misgivings that Lord Ellesmere's Shakespearean manuscripts were all modern forgeries.J.O. Halliwell, Curiosities of Modern Shaksperian Criticism (John Russell Smith, London 1853), (Internet Archive). ", "In 1855, in Notes and Queries, Volume X, Collier reported a new \"find\" in the re-discovery of his own shorthand notes from lectures given by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1811 or 1812, which he published as a volume in 1856 together with a list of the emendations in the Perkins Folio.J.P. Collier, Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton(Chapman and Hall, London 1856), (Internet Archive). In a public letter soon extended into a short tract of 1855, A.E. Brae (anonymously) brought evidence challenging the authenticity of Collier's lecture notes, and in effect accusing Collier of having perpetrated the Shakespeare alterations as a fraud.A.E. Brae, Literary Cookery: with Reference to Matter Attributed to Coleridge and Shakespeare. A letter addressed to \"The Athen\u00e6um.\" With a postscript containing some remarks upon the refusal of that journal to print it (John Russell Smith, London 1855), (Internet Archive). In response to these challenges, in January 1856 Collier made a legal affidavit swearing to the truth of his statements regarding the Coleridge lectures and the Perkins folio, and sought to move the Court of Queen's Bench for a criminal action for libel against the publisher John Russell Smith. While Lord Campbell, presiding, refused to proceed, he commended the character of the applicant and pronounced him to be vindicated by his affidavit, and afterwards gave Collier other tokens of his friendship and esteem.Warner, 'Collier, John Payne', Dictionary of National Biography.", "Collier's second edition of the Works of Shakespeare appeared in 6 volumes in 1858, and bore both in its Preface and in the notes to the text a scathing attack on (among others) Alexander Dyce, accusing him of selective appropriation of Collier's emendations without acknowledgement, motivated by an intention to disparage.J.P. Collier (ed.), Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, Tragedies and Poems, 2nd Edition, 6 volumes (Whittaker and Co., London 1858), Vol. 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6 (Internet Archive). Their friendship irrecoverably broken, Dyce responded in a full volume by rejecting Collier's charges against him as artful and deliberate misrepresentations.A. Dyce, Strictures on Collier's New Edition of Shakespeare, 1858 (John Russell Smith, London 1859), (Google). ", "In 1853 Collier had made a gift of the Perkins Folio to his patron, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, who remained supportive towards him but died in 1858. In 1859, his cousin and successor the 7th Duke submitted the Folio to the scrutiny of Sir Frederic Madden, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, and Nicholas Hamilton, of that Department, who pronounced that the emendations were incontestably forgeries of modern date. These findings were further confirmed by a microscopic physical analysis by N.S. Maskelyne, Keeper of the Mineral Department, showing that the supposed archaic handwriting of the emendations was made using not ink but a sepia paint, which overlay erased pencil annotations in modern handwriting closely resembling that of John Payne Collier. The facts were presented by C.M. Ingleby in collected form in 1859, with a full-page dedication naming Andrew Edmund Brae as the first to protest against the specious readings of the Perkins Folio, and, by the use of philological methods, the first to prove that they were modern fabrications.C.M. Ingleby, The Shakspeare Fabrications; or, the MS. Notes of the Perkins Folio Shown to be of Recent Origin.
