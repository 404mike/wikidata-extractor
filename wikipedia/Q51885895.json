Initially some early 1970s recordings were recorded under the musical direction of Roland Shaw, Ralph Dollimore and Stan Reynolds, but thereafter all recordings were supervised by trombonist Don Lusher, who led the band for 25 years until 2000, with mostly original Heath alumni. The final concert in December 2000, was a sell out at London's Royal Festival Hall, attended by most Heath personnel past and present and the Heath family. The band at that performance was made up almost entirely of players who had played under Ted Heath's leadership. Numerous radio and television tributes have been broadcast over the years."]}, {"page": "Reynolds (surname)", "response": ["*Stan Reynolds, Canadian businessman", "*Stan Reynolds, English jazz trumpeter"]}, {"page": "1926 in jazz", "response": ["* 16 \u2013 Stan Reynolds, British trumpeter, guitarist and bandleader (died 2018)."]}, {"page": "Stan Reynolds", "response": ["Reynolds was born in Wetaskiwin in 1923.
