He was educated at Eton College and subsequently at Christ Church, Oxford. Having been called to the Bar, he was one of the six clerks in Chancery until the time of his father's death. In 1806 he was elected Member for Dumbartonshire, but he lost his seat in the general election of the following year. In 1812 he became Member for Stirlingshire and held the seat until his death. A Tory like his father, he supported Lord Liverpool's government during the later part of the Napoleonic Wars.\nEdmonstone married firstly, Emma, daughter of Richard Wilbraham Bootle of Rode Hall, Cheshire, by whom he had a son and a daughter. He married secondly on 5 December 1804 Louisa Hotham (9 October 1778 \u2013 30 August 1840), daughter of Beaumont Hotham, 2nd Baron Hotham, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. His second daughter, Louisa Henrietta, married John Kingston of Demerara in 1829. He died at Brighton in 1821, apparently from a stroke, aged fifty eight, and was succeeded by his eldest son.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
