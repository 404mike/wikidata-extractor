He played one further game in the Third Division North in the 1936\u201337 season, and featured in one league and one FA Cup game in the 1937\u201338 campaign. He was given a free transfer to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in May 1938. The \"Cherries\" finished 15th in the Third Division South in 1938\u201339, before competitive football was put on hold throughout World War II. He returned to Port Vale as a guest in October 1939, and scored ten goals in twenty games of the 1939\u201340 season, before departing again in April 1940. He also guested for Chester and Reading, before returning to Bournemouth. Under the stewardship of Harry Kinghorn, Bournemouth finished seventh in 1946\u201347. Tunnicliffe scored seven goals in 49 league games at Dean Court, before switching to Welsh club Wrexham. The \"Dragons\" finished third in the Third Division North in 1947\u201348, though were ten points behind champions Lincoln City. They dropped down to ninth place in 1948\u201349, before finishing just two places and one point ahead of bottom club York City in 1949\u201350. After manager Les McDowall was replaced by Peter Jackson, Wrexham rose to 14th position in 1950\u201351, and posted an 18th-place finish in 1951\u201352. Wrexham made a genuine bid for promotion in the 1952\u201353 season, but again finished in third place, just three points behind leaders Oldham Athletic. In total, Tunnicliffe made 236 league appearances, scoring 74 goals in his six years at the Racecourse Ground. In 1953 he signed for league rivals Bradford City, where he spent two-and-a-half seasons, scoring 20 goals in 89 league matches. Ivor Powell's \"Citizens\" finished fifth in 1953\u201354, before dropping down to 21st position in 1954\u201355; Tunnicliffe finished as the \"Bantams\" top-scorer in 1954\u201355, despite only finding the net seven times during the campaign. He then left both Valley Parade and the Football League to join Cheshire County League side Stafford Rangers."]}, {"page": "John Currie (footballer, born 1921)", "response": ["Currie scored two goals in eight Third Division South games for Harry Kinghorn's Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic in the 1946\u201347 season. He also enjoyed a loan spell with Stafford Rangers, before switching permanently from Dean Court to Staffordshire based Port Vale in June 1947. He only managed nine Third Division South appearances in the 1947\u201348 season and was released from The Old Recreation Ground in the summer by manager Gordon Hodgson."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Hutchinson", "response": ["Hutchinson played for Aqueduct and Sheffield United before the outbreak of World War II, in which he guested for Bradford City, the Royal Navy, Lincoln City, Hull City and Port Vale. After the war he moved on to Harry Kinghorn's Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, scoring three goals in eight Third Division South games in 1946\u201347. He left Dean Court and spent the 1947\u201348 season with Lincoln City, and scored 21 league goals as Bill Anderson's \"Imps\" won the Third Division North title by a one-point margin over Rotherham United. However Lincoln were relegated out of the Second Division in last place in 1948\u201349, and Hutchinson left Sincil Bank. He spent the 1949\u201350 campaign with Oldham Athletic, scoring three goals in 14 Third Division North appearances for Billy Wootton's \"Latics\". He never found another club in the Football League after leaving Boundary Park, and instead played non-league football for Denaby United."]}]}}
