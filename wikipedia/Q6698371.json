In 1675 she dedicated a manuscript copy of the translation to acquaintance and literary patron Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, repudiating the work and declaring it to be in conflict with her Puritan values. This manuscript was sold to the British Library by his heirs in 1853, however it did not at first attract much attention. Her title as first English translator of the De Rerum Natura is challenged by an anonymous manuscript prose translation, likely of the same decade, now preserved at Oxford (Bodleian MS Rawl. D.314).
