By the early modern era, they were most common in parts of the Scottish Highlands, on the Isle of Man, in north and mid Wales, and in parts of Ulster.Hutton, p. 369 F. Marian McNeill says that a force-fire (or need-fire) was the traditional way of lighting them, but notes that this method gradually died out. Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt.Campbell, John Gregorson (1900, 1902, 2005) The Gaelic Otherworld. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh: Birlinn Ltd.  pp. 559\u201362 It is suggested that the fires were a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic\u2014they mimicked the Sun, helping the \"powers of growth\" and holding back the decay and darkness of winter.Frazer, James George (1922). The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion. Chapter 63, Part 1: On the Fire-festivals in general. They may also have served to symbolically \"burn up and destroy all harmful influences\". Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires (as well as their smoke and ashes) were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers.Hutton, pp. 365\u201368"]}, {"page": "Halloween costume", "response": ["From at least the 16th century,McNeill, F.
