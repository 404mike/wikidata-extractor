Having found recognition with his revues in the late 1930s, Trinder was one of the United Kingdom's foremost entertainers during the Second World War. He starred in several Ealing Studios films including Sailors Three (1940), Champagne Charlie (1944) and Bitter Springs (1950). Trinder became a television star during the 1950s, notably as the original host for Sunday Night at the London Palladium (1955-1958). He was chairman of Fulham Football Club between 1959 and 1976.

Under Tommy Trinder's chairmanship in the 60s, flags of all other teams in the Division 1 were proudly flown along the Thames. However, when Fulham were relegated in 1968, Trinder decided not to change the flags as \"Fulham won't be in this division next season\". True to Trinder's prophecy, Fulham were relegated again.

Bret believes that post-war audiences wanted intrigue, suspense and romance, through the films of James Mason, Stewart Granger, David Niven and Laurence Olivier. Bret also indicates that Formby's cinematic decline was shared by similar performers, including Gracie Fields, Tommy Trinder and Will Hay. Formby's biographers, Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, opine that in his late 40s, Formby \"was greying and thickening out\", and was too old to play the innocent young Lancashire lad.
