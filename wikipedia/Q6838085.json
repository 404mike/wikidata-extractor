He has managed Huddersfield Town, Scunthorpe United and Sunderland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["A recovery started under manager Mick Buxton, who was appointed in 1978. Huddersfield won the Fourth Division in 1979\u201380, scoring 101 goals in the process. Town finished just outside the promotion places the following season. The team won promotion to the Second Division in 1982\u201383 by a third-place finish. Due to Huddersfield languishing at the bottom of the division, declining home attendances, and the resulting financial pressure, Buxton was sacked in December 1986. Steve Smith succeeded him, and became the first (and as of , only) permanent manager in the club's history to hail from Huddersfield. The team stayed up by three points that season, but were relegated back to the third tier in 1987\u201388. Town only won six matches, conceded 100 goals, and lost 10\u20131 against Manchester City. Huddersfield reached the 1991\u201392 Third Division play-offs, but lost the semi-final against Peterborough United by an aggregate score of 4\u20133."]}, {"page": "Scunthorpe United F.C.", "response": ["Whilst preparations for the new ground were underway, the club's final season at the Old Show Ground very nearly yielded success. Under the management of Mick Buxton, United qualified for the Division Four play-offs. Ultimately this was not to be, with the Iron losing 2\u20133 on aggregate to Torquay United in the semi-final. The second leg of this semi-final was to be the last game played at the Old Show Ground, with Steve Lister being the last player to score at the ground.", "The following four seasons saw United sit consistently in the middle of the now Third Division table under a succession of managers, namely Richard Money and Dave Moore. Mick Buxton made a surprise return to the club as manager following Moore's sacking in 1996.", "In February 1997, following the end of Mick Buxton's second spell in charge of Scunthorpe United, Brian Laws, one of Buxton's signings to the club as a player, was appointed manager, with Mark Lillis (another Buxton signing) as his assistant. In 1997\u201398, his first full season in charge, the Iron finished one point outside the play-offs. The following season, the club finished fourth in Division Three. This ensured qualification to the play-offs, which they won after a 3\u20132 aggregate win in the semi-finals over Swansea City and a 1\u20130 win over Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley with an early goal from Alex Calvo-Garcia. They were unable to maintain their Division Two status the following season however, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place."]}, {"page": "Terry Butcher", "response": ["Butcher re-registered himself as a player in August 1992, when he signed for Sunderland \u2013 founder members of the new Division One, which was the second tier of English football following the creation of the new FA Premier League. He played 38 times for the Wearside club in 1992\u201393, becoming player-manager following the dismissal of manager Malcolm Crosby in January 1993 and securing their Division One survival by a single place. He never played again for the club and was sacked on 26 November 1993 after a disappointing start to the 1993\u201394 season saw them battling relegation once again \u2013 with the battle being won under Butcher's successor Mick Buxton."]}, {"page": "Ryhope", "response": ["* Former Sunderland AFC Manager Mick Buxton"]}, {"page": "Dominic Matteo", "response": ["He made his Premier League debut for the \"Reds\" on 23 October 1993, when he replaced an injured John Barnes at left-wing in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City at Maine Road. He made a total of 13 appearances during the 1993\u201394 season. He joined Mick Buxton's Sunderland on loan in March 1995, but made just one First Division appearance for the \"Black Cats\", in a 2\u20130 defeat to Barnsley at Oakwell on 24 March. After the game it transpired that his loan had not been registered in time, leaving him unable to play for Sunderland; though he had technically been an ineligible player against Barnsley, Sunderland escaped with only a \u00a32,500 fine."]}, {"page": "Brett Angell", "response": ["Southend settled into the Second Division, finishing in the top-half of the table in 1991\u201392, and Angell again finished as the club's top scorer with 23 goals and was named as the club's Player of the Year. The Roots Hall faithful continued to witness second-tier football in 1993\u201394, however Angell attracted interest from bigger clubs, and joined top-flight Everton on loan in September 1993 and again in January 1994. Despite Angell playing just one game in each spell, manager Mike Walker signed him for a fee of \u00a3500,000 on 21 January (\u00a3160,000 of this went to Stockport as part of a tribunal agreement made four years earlier). However Angell had just undergone major surgery on his left leg and was unable to play to his full potential so it proved to be a disastrous spell, his only goal in nineteen games for the \"Toffees\" being a tap-in against Chelsea. Neville Southall later said that \"the step up to the Premier League was probably too much for him\" and he \"had a first touch like a tackle\". Manager Joe Royle sold Angell to Sunderland for \u00a3600,000 in March 1995, where he was similarly unsuccessful. He played eleven games for the \"Black Cats\", scoring once in the League Cup at Preston. Manager Mick Buxton was sacked shortly after Angell arrived at the club, and he failed to impress new boss Peter Reid. He is widely regarded by fans of both Everton and Sunderland as one of the worst players to turn out for both of these clubs, where he failed to reproduce the form he showed in the lower divisions."]}, {"page": "Sam Allardyce", "response": ["In July 1984, he was signed by Mick Buxton at Second Division Huddersfield Town. The move reunited him with Paul Jones, his former centre-half partner at Bolton. Huddersfield finished in 13th place in the 1984\u201385 season, and at the end of the campaign accepted an offer of \u00a315,000 from Bolton Wanderers, who offered Allardyce a three-year contract. Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright, who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce's first spell with the club. However Wright was sacked in December 1985, and his successor, Phil Neal, did not get along with Allardyce. Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce to the bench, despite Neal being a full-back. Bolton reached the 1986 Associate Members' Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, which ended in a 3\u20130 defeat to Bristol City, with Allardyce as an unused substitute."]}, {"page": "Richard Money", "response": ["With the appointment of Mick Buxton as manager in April 1987, Scunthorpe came close to automatic promotion in the 1987\u201388 and 1988\u201389 Fourth Division seasons, but lost in the play-offs on both occasions.http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/fla/1987-88.html & http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/fla/1988-89.html Highlighting Andy Flounders, Tony Daws, Kevin 'Ticker' Taylor and Ron Green as particularly talented team-mates during this time, when asked if the team was good enough to get promoted, Money admitted: \"Yes, definitely. We should have gone up automatically.\"Bell, Max (31 August 2020). Scunthorpe United: 20 Legends. Vertical Editions. p61. "]}]}}
