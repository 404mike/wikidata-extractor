McGregor was playing for Burnbank Athletic before signing for Dundee United in 1928 following Bill Paterson's transfer to Arsenal. He made his United debut in February 1928, sharing goalkeeping duties with Alex Johnstone during the 1927\u201328 season. He became the second choice keeper for the 1928\u201329 season and helped the side to promotion, winning the Scottish Second Division championship, although he also spent time on loan at Montrose. During the First Division campaign that followed, McHugh became first choice again and attracted interest from Portsmouth, signing for the club in November 1930 for a fee of \u00a3400. McHugh went on to play for Watford and had a loan spell with Southend United during his time at Vicarage Road.", "link_mentions": {}}}
