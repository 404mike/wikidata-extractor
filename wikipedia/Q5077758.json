Her early works were botanical illustrations for her father's publications, such as The Gardener's Chronicle. She emigrated to Vancouver Island in 1860, where her husband, Henry Pering Pellew Crease, was a prominent judge. Crease taught Sunday school in the Anglican church and was a volunteer and fundraiser for many local cultural institutions. She is noted for her watercolours of the Hudson's Bay Company fort, the city of Victoria, British Columbia, and other British Columbia locales. In her later life glaucoma limited her ability to paint. Her body of work comprises a \"detailed pictorial record of colonial British Columbia\"."]}]}}
