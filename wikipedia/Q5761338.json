Fenemore played mainly supporting roles which were characterised in her obituary in The Stage as \"friends, neighbours, mothers and passers-by\"; however, her many credits meant that she fell into the category of actresses who a majority of film and TV viewers would have been unable to name, yet whose face was instantly recognisable. Her longest-running role was recurring character Jennie Wren in TV series Dixon of Dock Green, who she played for six series between 1960 and 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977 in film", "response": ["| The Haunting of Julia || Astral Films / Cinema International Corporation / Canadian Film Development Corporation || Richard Loncraine (director); Dave Humphries (screenplay); Mia Farrow, Keir Dullea, Tom Conti, Jill Bennett, Robin Gammell, Cathleen Nesbitt, Anna Wing, Edward Hardwicke, Mary Morris, Pauline Jameson, Arthur Howard, Peter Sallis, Damaris Hayman, Sophie Ward, Hilda Fenemore, Nigel Havers, Samantha Gates, Denis Lill, Julian Fellowes, Michael Bilton, Susan Porrett || Horror || Live Action"]}, {"page": "Dixon of Dock Green", "response": ["| Hilda Fenemore || Jennie Wren || 1960\u20131965 || 7\u201312 || 39"]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["Mind Your Own Business (8 July 1970) starring Norman Bird, Hilda Fenemore, Derek Griffiths, Tony Selby and Cheryl Hall"]}, {"page": "Hilda", "response": ["* Hilda Fenemore (1914\u20132004), English actress"]}, {"page": "List of female movie actors by name: E\u2013F", "response": ["*Hilda Fenemore (1919\u20132004)"]}, {"page": "Carry On Nurse", "response": ["*Hilda Fenemore as Mrs Rhoda Bray"]}, {"page": "Emma (1972 TV serial)", "response": ["* Hilda Fenemore \u2013 Mrs Cole"]}, {"page": "Carry On Constable", "response": ["*Hilda Fenemore as Agitated woman"]}, {"page": "The Strange World of Planet X (film)", "response": ["* Hilda Fenemore as Mrs. Hale"]}, {"page": "The Stud (film)", "response": ["* Hilda Fenemore as Mrs Blake"]}, {"page": "Chico the Rainmaker", "response": ["* Hilda Fenemore as Hilda Page"]}, {"page": "Ring Dem Bells", "response": ["*Hilda Fenemore as Queenie Beal"]}, {"page": "List of Are You Being Served? characters", "response": ["=== The Cleaners (Hilda Fenemore and others) ===", "Even though Hilda Fenemore played one character, (a cleaner), it was assigned three names - Elsie Makepiece, Daphne Ackroyd, and Ivy.
