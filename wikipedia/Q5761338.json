Fenemore played mainly supporting roles which were characterised in her obituary in The Stage as \"friends, neighbours, mothers and passers-by\"; however, her many credits meant that she fell into the category of actresses who a majority of film and TV viewers would have been unable to name, yet whose face was instantly recognisable. Her longest-running role was recurring character Jennie Wren in TV series Dixon of Dock Green, who she played for six series between 1960 and 1965.", "link_mentions": {}}}
