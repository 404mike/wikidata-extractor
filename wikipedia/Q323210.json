Initial sessions with the group were held at The Manor Studio: the band were overawed and intimidated by Horn's reputation, and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Johnson said in his autobiography, \"Whatever he said we went along with\". When attempts to record with the full band proved unsatisfactory, Horn hired former Ian Dury backing band the Blockheads for the sessions, with Norman Watt-Roy providing the original bass line. Those sessions were later deemed to be not modern-sounding enough. Horn then constructed a more electronic-based version of the song with keyboards by session musician Andy Richards and with rhythm programming assistance from J. J. Jeczalik of Art of Noise. Horn developed this version of the recording in his west London studio while the band remained in their hometown of Liverpool. Horn had made three versions of \"Relax\" prior to Richards and guitarist Stephen Lipson joining his ZTT Production 'Theam' in late 1983. Horn left the studio late one night asking for Lipson to erase the multitrack (of version 3) due to lack of progress, but came back into the studio some time later to hear Richards playing a variety of modal chords based around the key of E minor with Lipson playing guitar along to the unerased multitrack."]}, {"page": "Trevor Horn", "response": ["In early 1981, Horn left Yes and became a full-time producer. His wife advised him to branch off from being an instrumental musician as he could reach greater success in production, and subsequently she became Horn's manager. He assembled a studio rig which included a Roland TR-808 drum machine and sequencer and a set of Simmons electronic drum modules. He spent \u00a318,000 on a Fairlight CMI synthesiser, one of four in the country at the time. \"I knew what it was capable of, because I understood what it did. Most other people didn't understand at the time \u2013 sampling was like a mystical world\". Horn realised he needed full-time assistance in operating the machine and hired J. J. Jeczalik to programme it. For his use of the Fairlight, Horn is credited as the \"key architect\" in incorporating sampling into \"the language of pop\"."]}, {"page": "Art of Noise", "response": ["Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were an English avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 That this is written by Morley is revealed by the appearance of the first half in the press materials for the Influence compilation and on the ZTT website as \"Art of Noise, a biography by Paul Morley\". by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J.

J. Jeczalik, engineer Gary Langan and keyboard player/string arranger Anne Dudley. The team produced ABC's 1982 debut album The Lexicon of Love, increasingly using the Fairlight to tweak live-based elements of performance but also to embellish the compositions with sound effects such as a cash register's bell on \"Date Stamp\" (Dudley also co-wrote a track on the album, which launched her scoring career). The team also worked on Malcolm McLaren's 1982 album Duck Rock and would go on to work with Frankie Goes to Hollywood on what would become the album Welcome to the Pleasuredome (realised predominantly on Fairlight).", "* J.

The first two theme tunes (the first from 1977 to 1982, and the second from 1983 to 1985) were written by Mike Moran. The theme tune used between 1986 and 1993 was performed by Art of Noise, and is perhaps the programme's best-known theme. It was written by band members Anne Dudley and J. J. Jeczalik. The exact version of this theme tune varied in some episodes/series-for example, the drum beats in the music in some episodes/series were more emphasised, as was the synthesizer melody, but generally it remained the same. Mistakenly referred to as \"Beat Box\", the track which appeared on their debut album Who's Afraid of the Art of Noise?, it is in fact an original composition, and was reworked as \"Crusoe\" in 1987. A version of the Art of Noise theme, first heard in 1986, was released on the compilation album Influence in 2010. For the 1995 series, the theme tune was a reworked version of the 1986-93 theme tune, but was performed by Dudley alone with the incidental music composed by Mike Woolmans."]}, {"page": "Jean Paul Gaultier", "response": ["In 1988, Gaultier released a dance single titled \"How To Do That\" on Fontana Records, from which came one of the first ever \"single title\" remix albums, Aow Tou Dou Zat, on Mercury Records.
