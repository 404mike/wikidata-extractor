This article deals with marine art as a specialized genre practised by artists who did little or nothing else, and does not cover the marine works of the leading painters of the period, such as, and above all, J.M.W. Turner.  The tradition of British marine art as a specialized genre with a strong emphasis on the shipping depicted began in large part with the artists Willem Van de Velde the Elder and his son, called the Younger in the early 18th century.Foreword, 1, Brook-Hart. The Van Veldes, originally from Holland, moved to England to work for King Charles II).Brewington, Preface. By the 17th century, marine art was commissioned mostly by merchant seamen and naval officers and created by marine art specialists (rather than artists in general). In part, marine art served as a visual portrayal of Britain's power on the sea and as a way of historically documenting battles and the like.Tracy 3, 5. As British sea captains began to recognize the ability of marine artists to bring Britain's success on the sea to the public on land, some took on an active role in supporting this type of artwork. For example, marine artist Robert Cleveley was hired by Captain William Locker to work in  as a clerk, and Captain Locker, interested in employing artists, is believed to have played a significant role in encouraging Cleveley to work as a marine painter.Tracy, 72. Captains would act as marine artists' patrons, commissioning them to paint portraits of themselves and pictures depicting important battles. A few significant marine artists who were supported in this way by naval officers are (among others) Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Luny, and George Chambers.Tracy, 5. William Hodges, for example, who was trained to draw at William Shipley's Academy (studying under Richard Wilson), was hired by the Admiralty to finish his pictures from Cook's 1772 voyage for publication upon reaching home in 1775.Tracy, 225. Captains also commissioned artists to paint portraits of their ships.", "There are far too many talented British marine artists from the Romantic Era to name them all here, but a few are William Anderson, Robert Cleveley, Thomas Luny, George Chambers, Nicholas Pocock, William Hodges, and Philip de Loutherbourg among many others.For more artists, Nicholas Tracy mentions in the preface to his work, Britannia's Palette: E.H.H.

He was never employed by the Royal Navy after reaching flag rank. Page continued to live in Ipswich through his retirement. He devoted a portion of his later life to protecting paintings of actions he and his patrons Hughes and Rainier had served in. In 1835 he discovered a series of eight paintings of Hughes' battles against Suffren by Dominic Serres hanging in some neglected corridors of the Greenwich Naval Hospital instead of in that building's painted hall where he had expected them to be. Angered by this, Page persuaded the hospital to give him the paintings in return for one larger painting, which ended up being a work by George Chambers on the Battle of La Hogue. He presented the paintings to Ipswich town hall, as Hughes also came from that town."]}]}}
