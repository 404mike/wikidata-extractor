Christian was notoriously bitter tongued, and   while  he despised  most of his colleagues, he seems to have had a particular dislike of Chatterton. He regularly voted on appeal to overturn his judgments, and frequently added  personal insults.Hogan, p.69 Nor did he confine his attacks to the courtroom: there was controversy in 1870 when remarks of Christian that Chatterton was \"lazy, stupid, conceited and so incompetent that he ought to be pensioned off\" found their way into the Irish Times.Hogan, p.70 The hint about pensioning off Chatterton was not taken up, no doubt because he enjoyed the confidence of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Thomas O'Hagan, 1st Baron O'Hagan, who was also on bad terms with Christian. In an appeal from Chatterton in 1873 the two  appeal judges clashed publicly, with O'Hagan reprimanding Christian for insulting a judge who was not there to defend himself.Hogan, p.72"]}, {"page": "Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet", "response": ["In May 1921, Monro was created a Baronet, of Bearcrofts in the Shire of Stirling.
