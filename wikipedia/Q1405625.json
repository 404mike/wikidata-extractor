It was written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984. Elites open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".", "Versions for 32X and Sega Mega Drive were in development but cancelled due to Sony backing out of the project and lack of publisher.

Elite A was released publicly in 1997.
