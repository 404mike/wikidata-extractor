He also played electric cello, viola da gamba, sitar and piano.  Ivashkin became co-principal cellist of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra.  In 1978, he founded the Bolshoi Soloists, a new chamber orchestra.From 1995, Ivashkin founded the Adam International Cello Festival and Competition. He was also artistic director of annual festivals in London, including The VTB Capital Prize for Young Cellists. In 1999 he founded a series of research and performance seminars/symposia and international concert series at the Centre for Russian Music. He was the curator of Alfred Schnittke Archive at Goldsmiths and the editor-in-chief of the ongoing Schnittke Collected Works Critical edition in 63 volumes.  Ivashkin published twenty books, on Schnittke, Ives, Penderecki, Rostropovich and others, and more than 200 articles in Russia, Germany, Italy, the US, the UK and Japan.\nIvashkin was the first performer and dedicatee of many contemporary compositions for cello, by such composers as Alfred Schnittke. He actively collaborated with composers such as John Cage, George Crumb, Mauricio Kagel, Krzysztof Penderecki, Peter Sculthorpe, Brett Dean, Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina, Giya Kancheli, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Rodion Shchedrin, Nikolai Korndorf, Dmitri Smirnov, Elena Firsova, Alexander Raskatov, Vladimir Tarnopolsky, Augusta Read Thomas, James MacMillan, Lyell Cresswell, Roger Redgate, Gabriel Prokofiev and Gillian Whitehead.\nIvashkin made commercial recordings for such labels as Chandos,  BMG and Naxos.  These issues include the complete cello music by Rakhmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Roslavets, Tcherepnine, Gubaidulina, Schnittke and Kancheli to his credit.\nIn 1969, Ivashkin married fellow musician Natalia Pavlutskaya, who survives her husband.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 17", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Alexander Ivashkin, Russian-English cellist and conductor (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["The Department of Music has a number of notable alumni, including Malcolm McLaren, Katy B, James Blake, Tunday Akintan, Rosie Lowe, John Cale and A.

He began his musical education in 1946 in Vienna, where his father had been posted. It was in Vienna, Schnittke's biographer Alexander Ivashkin writes, where \"he fell in love with music which is part of life, part of history and culture, part of the past which is still alive.\" \"I felt every moment there,\" the composer wrote, \"to be a link of the historical chain: all was multi-dimensional; the past represented a world of ever-present ghosts, and I was not a barbarian without any connections, but the conscious bearer of the task in my life.\"As quoted in  Schnittke's experience in Vienna \"gave him a certain spiritual experience and discipline for his future professional activities. It was Mozart and Schubert, not Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, whom he kept in mind as a reference point in terms of taste, manner and style. This reference point was essentially Classical ... but never too blatant.\"", "The Ninth Symphony was first performed on 19 June 1998 in Moscow in a version deciphered \u2013 but also 'arranged' \u2013 by Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who conducted the premiere. After hearing a tape of the performance, Schnittke indicated he wanted it withdrawn. After he died, though, others worked to decipher the score. Nikolai Korndorf died before he could complete the task, which was continued and completed by Alexander Raskatov. In Raskatov's version, the three orchestral movements of Schnittke's symphony may be followed by a choral fourth, which is Raskatov's own Nunc Dimittis (in memoriam Alfred Schnittke).

Schnittke's six-movement Second Symphony, following the Ordinary of the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church, works programmatically on two levels simultaneously. While soloists and chorus briefly perform the mass, set to chorales taken from the Gradual, the orchestra provides an extended running commentary that can continue much longer than the section of the mass being performed. Sometimes the commentary follows a particular chorale but more often is freer and wider ranging in style.

The choir can choose whether to sing the Ave Maria in Russian or Latin.
