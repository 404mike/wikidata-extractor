Their songs began as minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on Boy and October, before evolving with War to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive. Boy and War were labelled \"muscular and assertive\" by Rolling Stone, influenced in large part by Lillywhite's producing. The Unforgettable Fire, which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up The Joshua Tree, had Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois at the production helm. With their influence, both albums achieved a \"diverse texture\".

In the description of author and musician Bob Stanley, their domestic breakthrough represented \"a final liberation for Britain's teenagers\" and, by coinciding with the end of National Service, the group \"effectively signaled the end of World War II in Britain\". For sociologists, the band typified new developments in postwar Britain such as social mobility, teenagers' commercial influence, and informality in society. In their 1965 book Generation X, Charles Hamblett and Jane Deverson said the Beatles had supplied British youth culture with a unifying and liberating influence that departed from the usual American-inspired model and, together with other groups from outside London, had fostered a sense of celebration of provincial England.

It originally received little attention from both consumers and critics in the United Kingdom, with the exception of NME and Melody Maker, who were covering the Madchester music scene at the time. Bob Stanley from Melody Maker called it \"godlike\" and said the foundation of the music was John Squire's guitar playing, which he deemed \"beautifully flowing, certainly psychedelic, there are elements of Hendrix (especially on 'Shoot You Down') and Marr (check out the fade to 'Bye Bye Badman'), but the rest is the lad's own work\". In Q, Peter Kane was less favourable and felt that The Stone Roses was a promising album weighed down by \"strangely monotone production\", while NME journalist Jack Barron wrote that it was merely \"quite good\" while giving it a score of seven on a scale of 10; the latter magazine later ranked it as the second best record of 1989 in their year-end list. In The Village Voice, American critic Robert Christgau wrote that the group was \"overhyped\" and no different from the numerous indie bands in the United States, adding \"what do they do that the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield weren't doing better in 1967?\" He concluded that \"they're surprisingly 'eclectic.'

The first recording Minogue did after she signed with Deconstruction was a new version of Saint Etienne's third single \"Nothing Can Stop Us\" (1991).
