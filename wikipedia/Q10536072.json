Prior to the match the club signed Swansea City right back Connor Roberts on a one-month loan deal. Yeovil started the game poorly falling 2\u20130 behind at half time, but a goal 23 seconds into the second half through substitute Harry Cornick and a penalty from Matthew Dolan levelled the scores but the team eventually succumbed to a 3\u20132 defeat. On 11 August, Yeovil faced Queens Park Rangers at home in the first round of the League Cup, Yeovil though were outclassed with their Championship opponents running out 3\u20130 winners. Yeovil's first home league match of the season saw them face local rivals Bristol Rovers, on 15 August, a late Ellis Harrison goal saw Yeovil fall to a 1\u20130 defeat. On 18 August, ahead of the club's trip to York City, Yeovil signed Bournemouth midfielder Josh Wakefield on a one-month loan deal. The game itself was a poor one with Yeovil losing their third consecutive league match thanks to a goal from former Yeovil midfielder James Berrett. On 21 August, Paul Sturrock made his fifteenth signing of the summer with experienced midfielder David Norris joining on non-contract terms. On 22 August, Yeovil recorded their first win of the season after battling back from two goals down to beat Luton Town 3\u20132, with a goal from Fulham loanee Stephen Arthurworrey just before halftime and a brace from Ryan Bird in the second half helping Yeovil climb to nineteenth in the league. The result was the first time in ten years that the Glovers had come from two goals down to win a league match, and the first time since December 1999 at Huish Park. On 29 August, Yeovil traveled to unbeaten Oxford United and ended August with a 2\u20130 defeat.", "The 1 September saw Yeovil face Barnet in the first round of the Football League Trophy southern section at Huish Park, a dull game with just a single shot on target between the two sides was won courtesy of an own goal from Barnet defender Bira Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 as Yeovil progressed to face Coventry City in the second round. After the match manager Paul Sturrock revealed that midfielder David Norris had left the club after just one substitute appearance. On 5 September, Yeovil faced Morecambe and at half time led 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Harry Cornick and Omar Sowunmi either side of striker Shaun Jeffers being dismissed, 10-man Yeovil capitulated in the second half conceding four times to lose 4\u20132. After the match the loans of both Cornick and Connor Roberts were extended for a further month, while on 11 September, winger Jake Howells signed on a month's loan from Luton Town. On 12 September, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 at home with AFC Wimbledon, in the first meeting between the two sides Yeovil took the lead through Ryan Bird before former trialist Adebayo Akinfenwa equalised for the Dons with 11 minutes remaining. Prior to the trip to Crawley Town on 19 September, manager Paul Sturrock confirmed that youth team player Ollie Bassett would be making his first team debut, the attacking midfielder broke Steven Caulker's record as Yeovil's youngest ever player in the Football League by just 26 days and also the first youth team player to make his debut for Yeovil since Craig Alcock in May 2007. With the squad stretched due to injuries, Yeovil only named five substitutes one of whom was fellow youth team midfielder Max Melanson, despite this Yeovil recorded their first away win of the season courtesy of a 25-yard strike from Harry Cornick. During the week, Bournemouth midfielder Josh Wakefield returned to his parent club after the completion of his loan spell, and in his place Yeovil re-signed Swansea City player Josh Sheehan on loan until 28 December following a spell on loan at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. He made his second debut for the club on 26 September, in Yeovil's 2\u20131 home defeat to Hartlepool United, with Yeovil's goal coming courtesy of Ryan Bird's fourth of the season. On 29 September, Yeovil traveled to Accrington Stanley and despite a long range strike from loanee Josh Sheehan, Yeovil suffered another 2\u20131 defeat. Yeovil ended the month with a first round tie in the Somerset Premier Cup, with a team entirely made up of the club's youth team winning 3\u20132 away at Southern Premier League side Paulton Rovers."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 AFC Bournemouth season", "response": ["| 18 August 2015 || AM ||  || Josh Wakefield || Yeovil Town || 19 September 2015 || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 AFC Bournemouth season", "response": ["| 1 July 2016 || CM ||  || Josh Wakefield || Free agent || Released || "]}, {"page": "AFC Bournemouth Under-21s and Academy", "response": ["||  Josh Wakefield|| Attacking Midfielder|| 4 "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 National League", "response": ["|Josh Wakefield"]}]}}
