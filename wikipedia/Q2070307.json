In the preface of Christian Prince addressed to Charles the prince, Erasmus states that Isocrates \"was a sophist, instructing some petty king or rather tyrant, and both were pagans.\" Erasmus' use of logos and pathos immediately follow when he completes the eschewing of Isocrates:  \"I am a theologian addressing a renowned and upright prince, Christians both of us.\" A recent critic, Peter Gay describes Erasmus as \"a true classical spirit in his search for clarity and simplicity, a modern in complexity, an ancestor of the Enlightenment in his critical temper and pacific cosmopolitanism.  But, above all, he was a Christian intellectual.\" And while Cicero was considered the \"patron saint of the Renaissance era\" \u2013 a title that would become fundamentally problematic for a number of Christians because of his pagan beliefs \u2013 Erasmus came to be known as the \"prince of humanists\"  esteemed by many of his contemporaries as a \"man born to bring back literature.\"Qtd. in Percy Stafford Allen, ed. \"Erasmi Epistolae.\" Opus Epistolarum Des.
