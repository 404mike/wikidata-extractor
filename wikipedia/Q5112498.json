As bishop he built a strong reputation for developing vocations for the priesthood. In 2006, in an action that attracted press attention and political controversy, he ordered Christopher Hartley, a New York priest whose activism among Haitian immigrants he had long defended, to leave the diocese, apparently because Hartley had attempted to interfere in the process of episcopal appointments."]}]}}
