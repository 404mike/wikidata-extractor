His debut for Weymouth was in the 3\u20130 home win during a pre-season friendly against League Two side Bournemouth on 17 July. He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3\u20131 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute. Doe's first start for Weymouth was against Torquay United on 25 September, in their 3\u20132 away defeat. His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3\u20132. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2\u20131 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed \"there is no doubt that Scott got the ball\". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007\u201308 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the \"Supporters Player of The Year\" award, describing it as \"the best thing in the World\". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying \"when I first came to the club I thought I might play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and it has just been fantastic\" stated Doe."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|30||GK|| Jon Stewart || Unattached  || Free Transfer ||3 August 2011", "|30||GK|| Jon Stewart|| Alfreton Town ||Loan ||3 March 2012", "| Jon Stewart", "!scope=\"row\"|Jon Stewart"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jon Stewart", "|30||GK|| Jon Stewart || Alfreton Town || Loan ||31 August 2012"]}, {"page": "Shaw Lane A.F.C.", "response": ["* Jon Stewart"]}, {"page": "Jon Stewart (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jon Stewart (born 1962) is an American political satirist, writer, television host and stand-up comedian.
