He held the first Chair of Philosophy at Lancaster University. Sibley is best known for his 1959 paper \"Aesthetic Concepts\" (Philosophical Review, 68), and for \"Seeking, Scrutinizing and Seeing\" (Mind, 64, 1954). Both papers (and some others) have been anthologized, \"Aesthetic Concepts\" multiple times.\nSibley has been considered an important contributor to Aesthetics in the analytical tradition. His collected papers, including some posthumous, were published by Oxford University Press in 2001 as Approach To Aesthetics, together with a companion volume of critical and evaluative essays on his work.\nHe was the uncle of the writer and broadcaster Brian Sibley.", "link_mentions": {}}}
