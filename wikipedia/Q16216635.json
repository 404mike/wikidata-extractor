Barnet went down to ten men shortly after the half hour mark after a poor challenge from Greg Heald on Partridge. Brentford took control of the game and Martin Rowlands put them ahead in injury time of the first half; Paul Evans doubled their advantage on 75 minutes, and though Mark Gower grabbed Barnet a consolation and Rowlands was sent off for dissent in injury-time, the visitors went on finish the match 2\u20131 ahead. They had to then overcome Swansea City at Vetch Field and again found themselves a man up after Swansea goalkeeper Roger Freestone was shown a straight red for bringing down Lloyd Owusu in the penalty area, with Evans converting from the spot to put the \"Bees\" in a commanding position. Damien Lacey levelled the scores on 56 minutes, though McCammon restored Brentford's lead just two minutes later. The \"Swans\" again equalised after an impressive strike from Jason Price, though Owusu's late header gave Brentford a 3\u20132 win without resorting to extra-time."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|15||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Damien Lacey"]}]}}
