In 1986, Charles L. Dumoulin and Howard R. Hart at General Electric developed MR angiography, and Denis Le Bihan obtained the first images and later patented diffusion MRI.  In 1988, Arno Villringer and colleagues demonstrated that susceptibility contrast agents may be employed in perfusion MRI. In 1990, Seiji Ogawa at AT&T Bell labs recognized that oxygen-depleted blood with dHb was attracted to a magnetic field, and discovered the technique that underlies Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)."]}, {"page": "1986 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Ian Robert Young, Manager, Picker Research Laboratory, GEC plc."]}, {"page": "Ian Young", "response": ["* Ian Robert Young (1932\u20132019), British medical imaging researcher and inventor"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1989", "response": ["# Ian Robert Young"]}]}}
