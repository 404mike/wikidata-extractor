The sociologist Frank Furedi said that \"Intellectuals are not defined according to the jobs they do, but [by] the manner in which they act, the way they see themselves, and the [social and political] values that they uphold."]}, {"page": "Commodity fetishism", "response": ["The sociologists Frank Furedi and Ulrich Beck studied the development of commodified types of knowledge in the business culture of \"risk prevention\" in the management of money. The Post\u2013World War II economic expansion (c. 1945\u20131973) created very much money (capital and savings), while the dominant bourgeois ideology of money favoured the risk-management philosophy of the managers of investment funds and financial assets. From such administration of investment money, manipulated to create new capital, arose the preoccupation with risk calculations, which subsequently was followed by the \"economic science\" of risk prevention management.\"Paying for Pensions: Affording Old Age\", BBC News, 13 September 2010 In light of which, the commodification of money as \"financial investment funds\" allows an ordinary person to pose as a rich person, as an economic risk-taker able to risk losing money invested to the market. Hence, the fetishization of financial risk as \"a sum of money\" is a reification that distorts the social perception of the true nature of financial risk, as experienced by ordinary people. Moreover, the valuation of financial risk is susceptible to ideological bias; that contemporary fortunes are achieved from the insight of experts in financial management, who study the relationship between \"known\" and \"unknown\" economic factors, by which human fears about money can be manipulated and exploited."]}, {"page": "Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)", "response": ["The party originated as a tendency in the Revolutionary Communist Group which had split from the International Socialists in the 1970s.

Later that year, a monthly magazine called Living Marxism was set up for a wider readership. Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet, the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism. In December 1990, Living Marxism ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that \"for the time being at least, the working class has no political existence\".Frank Furedi \"Midnight in the Century\", Living Marxism, December 1990 In 1997, the point was put more forcefully: In today's circumstances class politics cannot be reinvented, rebuilt, reinvigorated or rescued. Why? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness. And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies cannot be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity.Frank Furedi \"Class politics cannot be rebuilt or regenerated today\", LM, May 1997"]}, {"page": "Revolutionary Communist Group (UK)", "response": ["A few years after the RCG's foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as Stalinism and the South African government.

Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been \"organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru\".Beckett 1999. In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members.Leversha 1978. p. 26.

This is a result of the large platform given to celebrities; as Jane Johnson, a reporter for the popular British celebrity publication Closer observed, the gossip surrounding celebrities is a nationally unifying factor among all social groups. This unification and large platform provided by celebrities has been a point of interest for political leaders and groups to gain farther reach within various campaigns. Young adults have had historically lower voter turnout than any other voting age group. Knowing this, politicians and public figures draw from the cultural resources curated by celebrities by mimicking the popular, accessible public persona given off by today's celebrities. As noted by author Frank Furedi, \u201cPoliticians self consciously attempt to either acquire a celebrity image or to associate themselves with individuals who possess this status\u201d. This can be seen with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who has become somewhat of a celebrity because of the perception of being personable and supporting progressive, liberal policies.

Like Durodi\u00e9, Furedi argues that perceptions of risk, ideas about safety and controversies over health, the environment and technology have little to do with science or empirical evidence.
