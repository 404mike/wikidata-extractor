Educating himself, he became a teacher and soon a headteacher.Coward's interest in music developed from a tonic sol-fa class, and in 1876 he founded the Sheffield Tonic Sol-fa Association.  This was renamed the Sheffield Musical Union, and Coward was its director until 1933.  His choral legacy is still visible in Sheffield, following Sheffield Music Union's 1837 merger with the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus, a choir which still performs to this day.In 1889, Coward obtained a B.Mus. degree at the University of Oxford, and in 1894, became a Doctor of Music.  He returned to Sheffield, where he became the chorus master of the Sheffield Music Festival.  He conducted societies in Leeds, Huddersfield, Newcastle and Glasgow, and toured worldwide with the Sheffield Choir.  He also taught music at Sheffield Training College and lectured at the University of Sheffield.In 1897, having established a reputation for conducting large numbers of singers in Sheffield parks, he was invited to oversee a gathering of 60,000 school-children in Norfolk Park in Sheffield, to entertain Queen Victoria.Dan Godfrey wrote that \"it is doubtful whether England has ever produced a better or more gifted choir trainer than Coward... He has evolved, formulated and put into practice a method of choral technique which has had the result of bringing about a revival of singing in chorus which has spread through the whole Empire.\"After World War I, Henry Coward faced criticism for being unable to conduct an orchestra, but was knighted in 1926 and, from 1929 to 1944, served as President of the Tonic Sol-fa College in London.Coward was a white supremacist who campaigned against jazz, describing it as \"atavistic, lowering, degrading and a racial question ... composed of ... unquestionably grotesque forms.\"Coward was an active Freemason being initiated in Furnival Lodge No.2558 Sheffield in 1896 and becoming a founding member of University Lodge No.3911 Sheffield in 1919.\nSir Henry Coward died in 1944, aged 94.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Symphony Chorus", "response": ["The choir's name was changed in 1932 to The BBC Chorus, and again in 1935 to become the BBC Choral Society when a professional choir named the BBC Chorus was established. Leslie Woodgate held the post of chorus master from 1934 until he died in 1961. He was wholly dedicated to the work of preparing the Society for the many arduous engagements it undertook, and raised the choir from the position of being, as Sir Henry Coward told Woodgate in 1936, 'nearly as good as my Yorkshire choir' to being at least as good as the great, long-established choral societies of the north. Important performances of new works continued: on 11 April 1934 there was Holst's First Choral Symphony (which had been premiered in Leeds Town Hall in 1925), and on 28 November 1934 the British premiere of Stravinsky's Pers\u00e9phone. In January 1935 Albert Coates conducted one of the Thirties\u2019 curiosities: the Symphony in C minor by Yuri Shaporin. The BBC Choral Society took part in Bart\u00f3k's Cantata Profana on 25 March 1936 under Boult; the London premiere of Vaughan Williams's Five Tudor Portraits on 27 January 1937; and, perhaps most remarkable of all, the British premiere of Busoni's Doktor Faust, which took place on 17 March 1937."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["The orchestra also gave popular Saturday night concerts at the Town Hall that continued until 1918, and performed widely alongside many different choral societies with conductors including Edward Elgar, Henry Coward and George Robertson Sinclair."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Henry Coward, choral conductor"]}, {"page": "Ernest Austin", "response": ["**Hymn of Apollo (words by Percy Shelley) (fp 1917, by the Leeds Choral Union cond. by Dr. Henry Coward), repeated the next year Also given by the Glasgow Choral and Orchestral Union in the autumn of 1919 under Landon Ronald, and again in 1922 "]}, {"page": "Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus", "response": ["Founded in 1876 by Henry Coward, the Sheffield Musical Union started as a tonic sol-fa class but grew in stature, undertaking international tours in early 1908 and 1911.Coward, H.
