In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman's revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights, which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Chomsky's response included two testimonials before the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon. The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Herman said that the controversy \"imposed a serious personal cost\" on Chomsky, Chomsky said that \"conformist intellectuals of East or West\" deal with dissident opinion by trying \"to overwhelm it with a flood of lies\". He regarded the personal criticism as less important than the evidence that \"mainstream intelligentsia suppressed or justified the crimes of their own states\"."]}, {"page": "\u00c9mile Durkheim", "response": ["More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert N.

Neil Gross, for example, argues that Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of the sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's. Searle responded that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed and, admitting he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said: \"Because Durkheim's account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\" Steven Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and argued point by point against the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding Gross's argument that Searle's work bears a great resemblance to Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle had never read Durkheim."]}, {"page": "Social fact", "response": ["* From \u00c9mile Durkheim, The Rules of the Sociological Method, (Edited by Steven Lukes; translated by W.\u00a0D.

The book Global Citizen Action, edited by Gaventa, is one such example. In an essay written for the book, Gaventa writes, \"Since the 1970s many activists have heard and been guided by the adage 'think globally, act locally.'

Barsky then cites a response by Chomsky in which he says that, by making no mention of this, Lukes is demonstrating himself to be an apologist for the crimes in Timor and adds on this subject, \"Let us say that someone in the US or UK... did deny Pol Pot atrocities.  That person would be a positive saint as compared to Lukes, who denies comparable atrocities for which he himself shares responsibility and know how to bring to an end, if he chose\".
