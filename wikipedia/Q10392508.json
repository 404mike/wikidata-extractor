With the euphoria of winning promotion over, Waddington knew that his side had to be strengthened to have any hope of surviving in the First Division and he broke the club's record transfer for Peter Dobing. He also brought in John Ritchie from non-league Kettering Town he would go on to become the club's record goalscorer. Stoke stayed up easily in 1963\u201364 and also reached the 1964 Football League Cup Final losing a 2 legged affair to Leicester City. Stoke then had several mid-table seasons before Waddington brought in World Cup winners George Eastham and Gordon Banks to the club in 1966\u201367. However two poor seasons followed 1967\u201368 and 1968\u201369 which saw Stoke narrowly avoid relegation. But another raid in the transfer market saw Stoke fortunes turn around dramatically, as Waddington brought in Jimmy Greenhoff and re-signed John Ritchie this combined with local players Alan Bloor, Denis Smith, Alan Dodd, Mike Pejic and Jackie Marsh plus the emergence of Terry Conroy, John Mahoney saw Stoke enjoy their best period in their history."]}, {"page": "Terry Conroy", "response": ["After taking the place of winger Gerry Bridgwood in the first team, he made an instant impact on his debut on 6 September 1967, by scoring the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory over Leicester City at the Victoria Ground. Though Conroy only made nine league appearances in the 1967\u201368 season, he was present on the final day 2\u20131 win over Liverpool which kept Stoke out of the First Division relegation zone. He was again registered with the Cleveland Stokers \u2013 now in the North American Soccer League \u2013 in the summer of 1968, but did not play a first team game for the club. He started to become a first team regular for Stoke in the 1968\u201369 season after scoring against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August, and went on to score in four consecutive games over the Christmas period. Waddington did though sometimes prefer to play John Mahoney to Conroy, using Mahoney as an extra defensive midfielder to make Stoke more solid defensively. Conroy also damaged cartilage in his knee after being challenged heavily by Manchester City's left-half Alan Oakes in a 3\u20131 defeat at Maine Road on 29 March, and was ruled out of action for five months. After recovering he went on to make 33 appearances in the 1969\u201370 campaign, and got some measure of revenge over Manchester City at Maine Road on 17 January by scoring the only goal of the game after dribbling past three defenders from the half-way line.", "Stoke qualified for Europe again in 1974\u201375, and managed to draw both legs with Dutch side Ajax, only to exit the competition on the away goals rule. However Conroy again struggled with injuries, and was limited to just 16 league appearances. He played most of these games as a centre-forward, as regular striker John Ritchie missed much of the season with a broken leg and Geoff Hurst was nearing the end of his career and was unable to play every game. Conroy scored his two career hat-tricks during the campaign, against Halifax Town in the League Cup on 11 September, and then against Carlisle United in a 5\u20132 league win on 22 March. At the end of the season Stoke had three games to play against mid-table sides and needed to win all three in order to win the league, however they lost at Sheffield United and had goalless draws with Newcastle United and Burnley, leaving the club with another fifth-place finish. Conroy was again limited to just 16 league appearances as he continued to suffer injury problems in the 1975\u201376 season, and underwent an operation to remove all the remaining cartilage from his knees. The club also suffered a disaster, as a strong gale blew a section of the roof off the Victoria Ground's Butler Street Stand on 2 January, and as the correct insurance was not in place the club were forced to sell key players such as Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Alan Hudson, John Mahoney and Geoff Salmons in order to finance stadium repairs."]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 League of Wales", "response": ["| John Mahoney"]}]}}
