During a military career that began in 1935 and ended in 1947, Hibbert saw action in the Battle of France, the North African Campaign, the Italian Campaign and Operation Market Garden. After these battles, he led a T-Force unit in Operation Eclipse, a campaign carried out by the Allies shortly before V-E Day.\nIn civilian life, after his time in the army, Hibbert enlarged and diversified his family's wine and spirits business. His restless first retirement, begun in the early 1970s, was followed by a 1981 retirement attempt that led his wife and him to ownership of Cornwall's Trebah Garden, which they went on to restore to its prewar splendour. In 2009, after nearly sixty years of marriage, Hibbert became a widower. Five years later, he died peacefully, at home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Market Garden", "response": ["Two of the three battalions of the 1st Parachute Brigade were slowed down by small German units of a training battalion which had quickly established a thin blocking line covering the obvious routes into Arnhem.

There was also a slave labour camp for the local industry. Because of its status as a naval port and as production site for submarines, Kiel was heavily bombed by the Allies during this period. The bombing destroyed more than 80% of the remaining old town, 72% of the central residential areas, and 83% of the industrial areas. During the RAF bombing of 23/24 July 1944, Luftwaffe fighters tried to intercept the spoof (i.e. decoy) force instead of the main force attacking Kiel, and there was no water for three days; trains and buses did not run for eight days and there was no gas available for cooking for three weeks.Campaign Diary: July 44 , Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary site .
