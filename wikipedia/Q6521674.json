He travelled to Catterick camp in Yorkshire where the band was based, did the audition, and got the job. This offered Hill a way to do his National Service as well as experience performing all around the world. After completing his military service, he toured with the musical Florodora, and he then became a singer with Teddy Foster's Band, a big band based in London. At the beginning of the 1960s, Hill joined the critically acclaimed British vocal group, The Raindrops, which gave him his first opportunity to perform in television and radio shows, especially on the BBC radio show Parade of the Pops. The Raindrops also had in its ranks Jackie Lee, Len Beadle and Johnny Worth. After leaving The Raindrops, Lee went on to record the popular singles \"White Horses\", and \"Rupert\", whilst Johnny Worth worked as a songwriter (under his pen-name, Les Vandyke he wrote many hits including the early successes of Eden Kane and Adam Faith)."]}, {"page": "Les Vandyke", "response": ["He worked in pubs as a semi-professional until he managed to secure a television appearance.

He then joined the Raindrops vocal quartet (together with Len Beadle, Len's wife Jackie Lee and Vince Hill), which appeared on the television programme Drumbeat and subsequent LP.

His first taste of chart success was provided by the theme music to children's TV programme The Adventures of Rupert Bear. The song \"Rupert\", co-written with Len Beadle and recorded by Beadle's wife Jackie Lee, made the UK Singles Chart in 1971. He also wrote the theme for Inigo Pipkin (later renamed Pipkins). Further success was attained when Roker met up with Lynsey Rubin (who was about to change her name to Lynsey de Paul). Together they penned \"Storm in a Teacup\" for The Fortunes, which landed them a Top Ten hit single; \"When You've Gotta Go\" which made the Dutch Tipparade (peak number 17) in late 1972, as well as the lower reaches of the Australian Aria chart in 1973; and also de Paul's third single, \"All Night\", which made the UK chart breakers listing in May 1973 and No. 17 on the Dutch Single Tip chart.

Rupert's friends and flying chariot appeared just as they had in the pages of the Daily Express, although he was joined by some new friends, including a sprite called Willy Wisp. One of the most-remembered elements of the series was the theme song, which was written by Len Beadle and Ron Roker, sung by Jackie Lee, and reached No. 14 in the United Kingdom charts in 1971.
