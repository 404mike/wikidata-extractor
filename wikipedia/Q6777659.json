Alexander kept clean sheets in both legs of the play-off semi-final, making his 100th appearance in all competitions for the Bluebirds during the second leg, earning plaudits for his performances which were described as \"faultless\". The club went on to achieve promotion by winning the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off Final against Queens Park Rangers following Andy Campbell's extra-time winner. During his time at Cardiff, Alexander became a fan favourite, despite nearly leaving the club midway through his six-year spell after falling behind Martyn Margetson and Tony Warner following their promotion to the First Division under manager Lennie Lawrence.

The club held talks with former England and Newcastle United captain Alan Shearer to replace Jones but he rejected the job despite stating that he was impressed with the \"vision, ambition and determination of the owner Dato Chan Tien Ghee and the board\". The Bluebirds instead approached Championship rivals Watford for permission to speak to their manager Malky Mackay, which was initially rejected. However, after the two clubs agreed a compensation fee, Mackay was officially appointed as Dave Jones' replacement on 17 June on a three-year contract. Mackay set about reshaping his coaching staff, allowing assistant manager Terry Burton, first-team coach Paul Wilkinson and fitness coach Alex Armstrong to leave the club, before appointing David Kerslake, Joe McBride and Richard Collinge as their replacements.
