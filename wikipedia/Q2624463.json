This led to the establishment of their Christian mission in New Zealand, which saw laymen arriving from 1814 to teach building, farming and Christianity to M\u0101ori, as well as training 'native' ministers. The M\u0101ori language (Te Reo M\u0101ori) did not then have an indigenous writing system. Missionaries learned to speak M\u0101ori, and introduced the Latin alphabet. The CMS, including Thomas Kendall; M\u0101ori, including T\u012btore and  Hongi Hika; and Cambridge University's Samuel Lee, developed the written language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission house of Anglican priest and the now head of the New Zealand CMS mission (later to become the New Zealand Church Missionary Society) Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published the Te Reo translations of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. His 1837 M\u0101ori New Testament was the first indigenous language translation of the Bible published in the southern hemisphere. Demand for the Te Reo New Testament, and the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian M\u0101ori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 M\u0101ori soon attending regularly.

Colenso made frequent visits to Whangaruru Bay over several years in the vain hope of procuring flowers and fruit. Colenso pointed out the tree to Dr Andrew Sinclair, (1794\u20131861), Colonial Secretary and naturalist, for whom the tree would eventually be named. Colenso and Sinclair sent specimens of the foliage to Kew.
