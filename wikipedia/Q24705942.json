Reflecting on the character's evolution in the television series, she stated: \"Throughout the season she's had an insane transformation from someone who barely even spoke and timidly did everything her brother said into a mother of dragons and a queen of armies and a killer of slave masters. She's a very Joan of Arc-style character.\" Clarke said she accepts appearing in nude scenes if \"a nude scene forwards a story or is shot in a way that adds insight into characters\". She added that \"sometimes explicit scenes are required and make sense for the characters/story, as they do in Westeros\" and that she can discuss with a director how to make a gratuitously nude scene more subtle. Clarke has used a body double in past background non-nude appearances, however, particularly Rosie Mac in season 5."]}, {"page": "List of The Little Mermaid adaptations", "response": ["* Little Mermaid (2017), an indie film set in the modern day with Rosie Mac as the titular character."]}]}}
