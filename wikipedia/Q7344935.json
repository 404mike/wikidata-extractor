In 1694 he was appointed tutor of his college, and in this capacity he acquired a reputation. John Colbatch, in his commemoration sermon preached in Trinity College Chapel, 17 December 1717, said of Laughton \"We see what a conflux of nobility and gentry the virtue of one man draws daily to one of our least colleges\". More colloquially, he was called a \"pupil-monger\".Walter William Rouse Ball, A History of the Study of Mathematics at Cambridge (1889), pp. 75\u20136, archive.org. Among his pupils were Martin Folkes, Benjamin Ibbot, and Robert Greene. He encouraged the study of Newton's Principia.", "In 1713 Laughton was an unsuccessful candidate for the mastership of his college, in an election that saw political tensions in Clare itself. Robert Greene, his former pupil, made clear his Tory allegiance. William Grigg was elected; in fact both he and Laughton were allies of Bentley and his reformist programme. Taking on George Parker as pupil in 1715, Laughton also reported to his father Lord Parker, the prominent Whig, on university politics. Laughton and Parker's agent Thomas Bell were heavily involved in supporting candidates for head of house, such as John Davies of Queens'."]}]}}
