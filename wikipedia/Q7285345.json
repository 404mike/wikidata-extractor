They may utilize the dolls as a substitute for a child. Some owners dress the dolls, wash their hair, and may even take them for walks in strollers and take them shopping. Reborn hobbyists refer to the emotional response to holding their dolls as cuddle therapy. Studies suggest cuddling a baby releases hormones which produce a sense of emotional well-being, and some psychologists believe that this may happen with realistic dolls as well. Consultant psychiatrist Raj Persaud explains that mothering a real newborn baby releases the hormone oxytocin in the mother, and hypothesizes that this may explain why \"reborn mothers\" become emotionally attached to the reborn baby doll."]}, {"page": "Dr. Raj Persaud", "response": ["#REDIRECT Raj Persaud"]}, {"page": "Life Beyond the Box: Margo Leadbetter", "response": ["The film also includes celebrity cameos from  Richard and Judy, Max Clifford, Raj Persaud, John Sergeant and Judith Chalmers."]}, {"page": "British Indo-Caribbean people", "response": ["Indo-Trinidadian people are thought to number well over 25,000, which is even more than the number of people born in Trinidad and Tobago living in the UK according to the 2001 Census.
