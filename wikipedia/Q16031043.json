Inspiration for the garden design followed visits by Powerscourt to ornamental gardens at the Palace of Versailles, Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, Vienna and Schwetzingen Palace near uHeidelberg.  The garden development took 20 years to complete in 1880.  On a commanding hilltop position, Cassels deviated slightly from his usual sombre style, to give the house something of what John Vanbrugh would have called the 'castle air' \u2013 a severe Palladian facade terminated by two circular domed towers.
