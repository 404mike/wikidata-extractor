The authors of the 2019 study hypothesised that it is extremely likely that historic cohorts of adults diagnosed with SPD either also had childhood-onset autistic syndromes or were misdiagnosed.

Cambridge University Press, 2006. , p. 447. Gillberg has done extensive research into autism throughout his academic career. In 2003, a French and Swedish research team at the Institut Pasteur and the psychiatric departments at Gothenburg University and University of Paris, led by Thomas Bourgeron, Marion Leboyer and Gillberg, discovered the first precisely identified genetic mutations in individuals with autism.Gosline, Anna. \"Roadmap to unravelling autism revealed\". New Scientist, 28 June 2005. Retrieved 20 August 2006. The team identified mutations altering two genes on the X chromosome which seem to be implicated in the formation of synapses (communication spaces between neurons), in two families where several members are affected. Previous studies, such as the Paris Autism Research International Sib-Pair Study (PARIS), coordinated by Gillberg and Marion Leboyer, have more generally associated the X-chromosome regions with autism. The 2003 breakthrough indicated the location of the mutation to be on the NLGN4 gene and the NGLN3 gene. The mutation prevents a complete protein from forming and is inherited from the mother.

It is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of autism. It was named after Hans Asperger (1906\u201380), who was an Austrian psychiatrist and pediatrician. An English psychiatrist, Lorna Wing, popularized the term \"Asperger's syndrome\" in a 1981 publication; the first book in English on Asperger syndrome was written by Uta Frith in 1991 and the condition was subsequently recognized in formal diagnostic manuals later in the 1990s.", "Lorna Wing coined the term Asperger's syndrome in 1976 and is also credited with widely popularizing the term in the English-speaking medical community in her February 1981 publication of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms. Wing also placed AS on the autism spectrum, although Asperger was uncomfortable characterizing his patient on the continuum of autistic spectrum disorders. She chose \"Asperger's syndrome\" as a neutral term to avoid the misunderstanding equated by the term autistic psychopathy with sociopathic behavior. Wing's publication effectively introduced the diagnostic concept into American psychiatry and renamed the condition as Asperger's; however, her accounts blurred some of the distinctions between Asperger's and Kanner's descriptions because she included some mildly retarded children and some children who presented with language delays early in life."]}, {"page": "Hans Asperger", "response": ["Asperger died before his identification of this pattern of behaviour became widely recognised. This was in part due to his work being exclusively in German and as such it was little-translated; medical academics, then as now, also disregarded Asperger's work based on its merits or lack thereof. English researcher Lorna Wing proposed the condition Asperger's syndrome in a 1981 paper, Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account, that challenged the previously accepted model of autism presented by Leo Kanner in 1943. It was not until 1991 that an authoritative translation of Asperger's work was made by Uta Frith; before this AS had still been \u201cvirtually unknown\u201d. Frith said that fundamental questions regarding the diagnosis had not been answered, and the necessary scientific data to address this did not exist. Unlike Kanner, who overshadowed Asperger, the latter's findings were ignored and disregarded in the English-speaking world in his lifetime."]}, {"page": "Lorna Wing, MD, FRCPsych", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lorna Wing"]}, {"page": "2014 in science", "response": ["*6 June \u2013 Lorna Wing, 85, English psychiatrist"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Lorna Wing, 85, psychiatrist, co-founder of the National Autistic Society, coined the term \"Asperger syndrome\"."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2014", "response": ["*Lorna Wing, 85, British psychiatrist, co-founder of the National Autistic Society, coined the term \"Asperger syndrome\".Lorna Wing \u2013 obituary"]}]}}
