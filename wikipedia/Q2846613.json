Pierluigi Martini and Luis P\u00e9rez-Sala qualified on the front row, followed by Andrew Gilbert-Scott. The championship leader Ivan Capelli spun early on, in his March 86B Cosworth powered car. Because of long delays, the first race was run over a reduced distance. The race was red-flagged when Gilbert-Scott was experiencing handling problems after an earlier spin. When he exited the Bristol Street Motors Bend on the 21st lap, he lost it and crashed into Alain Fert\u00e9's stationary car, blocking part of the track, with P\u00e9rez-Sala still fighting for the win from a fast catching up Martini. P\u00e9rez-Sala was given the win, Martini given second, and Michel Fert\u00e9 took third.
