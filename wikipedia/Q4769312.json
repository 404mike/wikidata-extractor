She was known as the bass guitarist and co-founder the Britpop band Elastica.Holland had an Elastica song named in her honour. \"Annie\" was written by guitarist Donna Matthews and her friend Jane Oliver and is about going down to Brighton to visit Holland, which is where she spent most of the time when the band were not working.Holland left the band after the F\u00e9ile Festival on 6 August 1995. Although she had some well-publicised arguments with Matthews about the future of Elastica, Holland left because she was fed up with the constant touring and was suffering quite badly from repetitive strain injury. At the time Elastica had been on the road for almost a year, and with even more dates being added to their schedule, Holland decided enough was enough.\n\nThe touring just got too much, I missed my friends and family in Brighton. We'd been on the road for months and I'd been looking forward to a break after T in the Park and the Feile Festival. But then we were offered the Lollapalooza tour and I couldn't face it.\nHolland re-joined Elastica in 1999 and remained a member until the band's demise in 2001.On 21 January 2017 Elastica's official Facebook page posted photos featuring three quarters of the original line-up \u2013 Holland, Matthews and Justin Welch \u2013 during a visit to Abbey Road Studios in London. Mastering engineer Sean McGee tweeted that he had just \"cut a record for Elastica today\" and that the band members \"hadn't seen each other for 20 years.\" The specific details of the record have yet to be announced, but in response to fan comments regarding lead singer Justine Frischmann's absence in the photos, the Facebook page stated that, \"Justine's involved in what's happening too.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elastica (album)", "response": ["* Annie Holland \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Annie Holland (Elastica)"]}, {"page": "Justin Welch", "response": ["On 21 January 2017, Elastica's official Facebook page posted photos featuring three-fourths of the original line-up - Welch, Donna Matthews and Annie Holland - during a visit to Abbey Road Studios in London.

By autumn of that year, bassist Annie Holland and guitarist Donna Matthews were added. After initially gigging under names such as \"Onk,\" they settled on the name \"Elastica\" in October 1992. They released their first single, \"Stutter,\" in October 1993, which benefited from the promotional efforts of BBC Radio 1 DJ and Deceptive Records label boss Steve Lamacq, who discovered the band earlier that year. In 1994, they released two UK Top 20 singles, \"Line Up\" and \"Connection\", and performed on numerous radio shows. Frischmann's relationship with Blur frontman Damon Albarn made tabloid headlines.", "The mid-90s witnessed another \"British Invasion\" in America. \"Stutter\" and \"Connection\" received airplay on modern rock radio and both charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at nos 67 and 53 respectively; their debut album also charted and was later certified gold). After performing at the 1995 Glastonbury Festival, the band joined the Lollapalooza tour continuing an almost solid year of constant gigs where they toured North America four times. Citing exhaustion, Annie Holland quit the band in early August 1995 and was replaced for the remainder of the tour by session bassist Abby Travis. Holland was not permanently replaced until the arrival of Sheila Chipperfield in the spring of 1996. Around this time, keyboardist David Bush (ex-the Fall) was added to the line-up.", "After playing more shows and demoing new material in the first half of 1996, Elastica entered the studio in the later part of the year to begin work on their second album. By late 1998 Matthews had left the band. She was replaced by guitarist Paul Jones (of the band Linoleum) and keyboardist Mew.
