Austen was also influenced by Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote (1752). Northanger Abbey was completed in 1803, the first of Austen's novels completed in full, but was published posthumously in 1817 with Persuasion. The story concerns Catherine Morland, the na\u00efve young protagonist, and her journey to a better understanding of herself and of the world around her. How Catherine views the world has been distorted by her fondness for Gothic novels and an active imagination. ", "Austen was also influenced by The Female Quixote; or, The Adventures of Arabella (1752) a novel by Charlotte Lennox that was an imitation and parody of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. It was approved by both Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, applauded by Samuel Johnson. "]}, {"page": "Samuel Johnson", "response": ["Besides working on the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote numerous essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: \"I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it.\" These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask \"that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others.\" The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, \"you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule.\" (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as \"the greatest Genius in the present Age.\"", "To occupy himself, Johnson began to work on The Literary Magazine, or Universal Review, the first issue of which was printed on 19 March 1756. Philosophical disagreements erupted over the purpose of the publication when the Seven Years' War began and Johnson started to write polemical essays attacking the war. After the war began, the Magazine included many reviews, at least 34 of which were written by Johnson. When not working on the Magazine, Johnson wrote a series of prefaces for other writers, such as Giuseppe Baretti, William Payne and Charlotte Lennox. Johnson's relationship with Lennox and her works was particularly close during these years, and she in turn relied so heavily upon Johnson that he was \"the most important single fact in Mrs Lennox's literary life\". He later attempted to produce a new edition of her works, but even with his support they were unable to find enough interest to follow through with its publication. To help with domestic duties while Johnson was busy with his various projects, Richard Bathurst, a physician and a member of Johnson's Club, pressured him to take on a freed slave, Francis Barber, as his servant."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox (c. 1730\u20131804), Scottish poet and novelist"]}, {"page": "1804 in literature", "response": ["*January 4 \u2013 Charlotte Lennox, English novelist and playwright (born c. 1730)"]}, {"page": "1775 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Old City Manners"]}, {"page": "1730 in literature", "response": ["*probable year \u2013 Charlotte Lennox, Gibraltar-born Scottish novelist and poet (died 1804)"]}, {"page": "1747 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Poems"]}, {"page": "1750 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The Life of Harriot Stuart"]}, {"page": "1752 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The Female Quixote"]}, {"page": "1753 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Shakespear Illustrated, or, The novels and histories on which the plays of Shakespear are founded, vol. 1"]}, {"page": "1756 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The Memoirs of the Countess of Berci"]}, {"page": "1758 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Henrietta", "*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Philander"]}, {"page": "1762 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 Sophia", "*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The Sister"]}, {"page": "1766 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The History of Eliza"]}, {"page": "1769 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Lennox \u2013 The Sister"]}, {"page": "Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calpren\u00e8de", "response": ["La Calpren\u00e8de wrote several long heroic romances that were later ridiculed by Boileau, and most of them were also referenced in Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote.
