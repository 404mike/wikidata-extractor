Once called \"the greatest inspired painter since William Blake\", Henry Stockley was arguably the most important primitive artists active in the period 1930 to 1960. Alan Clutton-Brock, art critic of The Times, was particularly impressed by his handling of figures and his ability \"to give its proper atmosphere to a landscape and keep a number of curious and unexpected colours in harmony with each other\". Stockley's work suffered years of neglect partially reversed with the publication of a number of articles on his life and artistic production and with a major exhibition devoted to his life and art at the London Transport Museum (July 1996 to March 1997). The location is significant. Although trained as a meat inspector, for many years Henry Stockley was a bus driver.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
