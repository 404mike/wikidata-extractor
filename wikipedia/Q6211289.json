The county played a total of ten matches, including three replays, which was a record for any winning team. Tyrone played five matches in the Ulster SFC, including replays against Cavan in the semi-final and against Armagh in the final, which they lost. Having to contest an All-Ireland SFC qualifier as a result of that loss, Tyrone overcame Monaghan to reach an All-Ireland SFC quarter-final against Dublin. Tyrone had yet another drawn game, a match memorable for Owen Mulligan's solo goal. Harte combined Enda McGinley with Joe McMahon for the second half of that game, a move which outwitted Ciar\u00e1n Whelan, who had been getting the better of his opponents in the first half; Whelan was ultimately removed from the game by the Dublin management. In the All-Ireland SFC semi-final, the county met Armagh for a third time; two points behind with only six minutes of play left and, in what Eamonn Sweeney writing later in the Sunday Independent called \"the defining moment of Harte's team\", Se\u00e1n Cavanagh scored a solo point, substitute Shane Sweeney levelled the game and Canavan converted an injury-time free.

Things then got worse as they relinquished their Ulster title to Down after a replay in which Down won by a point after 160 minutes. After two wins in the Football Qualifiers against Louth at Drogheda and Westmeath at Healy Park in Omagh, they faced Mayo in Round 3 in Croke Park for a place in the quarter finals. Tyrone defeated Mayo 0\u201313 to 1\u20139, earning Tyrone a place in the quarter finals (last 8) of the championship, where they faced Leinster champions Dublin in a repeat of the 2005 final clash. Tyrone made the brighter start to this game, and goals from Sean Cavanagh and Joe McMahon put Tyrone 2\u20135 to 1\u20133 up at the break. A third goal by David Harte in the second half ended the game as a contest, Tyrone winning 3\u201314 to 1\u20138. Tyrone then faced Wexford for a place in the senior football final but earlier in the day it was the Tyrone minors who booked their place in the final with a complete football performance, and eased past Meath on a scoreline of 1\u201321 to 2\u20137. They faced Mayo in the final. The seniors then always looked comfortable in their meeting with Wexford, and after racking up an 8-point lead at half-time they went through on a score of 0\u201323 to 1\u201314, to set up a 21 September date with All Ireland champions Kerry. In a thrilling All-Ireland Final Tyrone defeated Kerry 1\u201315 to 0\u201314 to win the Sam Maguire Cup for the third time. A week later the Tyrone Minor team defeated Mayo 1\u201320 to 1\u201315 in a replay to win the Thomas Markham Cup.
