Tony Cook began as a winger in local football only taking a turn in goal when the regular goalkeeper was unable to play. Cook had a trial for Bristol City and saved a penalty in a 0\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 26 December 1949. Bob Wright signed Cook on his return to Ashton Gate in December 1949 for Bristol City. Frank Coombes was replaced as Bristol City goalkeeper in January 1950 by Syd Morgan who himself had been discovered playing in the Downs League in Bristol. In 1950\u201351, Morgan contested the goalkeeping position with Con Sullivan who had joined from local Bristol side Horfield Old Boys six months before Cook. Sullivan was ever present in 1951\u201352. Cook finally got his chance after both Sullivan and Morgan had been tried in 1952\u201353. Cook made his debut in goal in the Third Division South in a 4\u20132 win v Swindon Town on 8 November 1952 and completed 29 consecutive appearances to the end of 1952\u201353 when Bristol City finished in fifth place. Cook made 38 appearances in 1953\u201354 before Morgan played in the final 8 matches as Bristol City rose to finish in third place. Tony Cook made 23 appearances in the opening games in 1954\u201355 then broke his arm versus Gillingham on 18 December 1954 when Bob Anderson played in the final 23 matches as Bristol City ended as Third Division South champions. Cook with 20 appearances shared the goalkeeping duties with Anderson in the Second Division in 1955\u201356. The following 1956\u201357 season, Cook began the season in goal making 21 appearances with Anderson finishing the season in the team. Cook made only 7 appearances in 1957\u201358 as Bristol City slipped to 17th in the table. Anderson started 1958\u201359 as first choice but Cook made 37 appearances and played in the fourth round FA Cup ties against Blackpool when the \"Robins\" lost 0\u20131 in a replay. Cook gained a reputation as a saver of penalties and saved six of the nine penalties he faced in 1958\u201359. Cook was ever present in the relegation season 1959\u201360 when Bristol City finished 22nd and bottom of the Second Division. Cook made 45 appearances in 1960\u201361 and in all six FA Cup ties as Bristol City lost 1\u20135 in the fourth round at Leicester City. Cook was the regular keeper in 1961\u201362 making 40 appearances as Bristol City finished sixth in the Third Division. Cook started as no.1 in 1962\u201363 but made only 15 appearances following another broken arm as Ron Nicholls took over. Cook made his final three appearances in the opening three matches of 1963\u201364 before Mike Gibson took over as the regular keeper."]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers F.C.
