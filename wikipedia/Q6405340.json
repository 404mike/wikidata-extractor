In the European series Borgia written by Tom Fontana, where he is played by Raimund Wallisch, his portrayal is more historically accurate in terms of his age and Sancia being his daughter. In Da Vinci's Demons he is played by Kieran Bew and is depicted as a sadistic warlord, bitterly jealous of Lorenzo the Magnificent."]}, {"page": "Brush with Fate", "response": ["* Kieran Bew \u2013 Adrian"]}, {"page": "After Miss Julie", "response": ["The Young Vic revived After Miss Julie in March 2012 as its first production of Classics for A New Climate.
