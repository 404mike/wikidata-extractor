Since 2010, he has been Professor of Cities and Society at Newcastle University's School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape. A qualified urban planner, he has an interdisciplinary background in human geography, urbanism and the sociology of technology. A widely cited  author in contemporary urban studies and related fields, Graham\u2019s work explores how cities and urban life are being reshaped by increased movement and mobility, intensifying social inequalities, the widespread application of digital technology, and the widening insecurities that characterise urban life. His most recent work has sought to rethink cities and urban life in fully three-dimensional ways that help to understand  their increased vertical reach (both far above and far below ground level).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Urbanism", "response": ["Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin argue that we are witnessing a post-urban environment where decentralized, loosely connected neighborhoods and zones of activity assume the former organizing role played by urban spaces. Their theory of splintering urbanism involves the \"fragmentation of the social and material fabric of cities\" into \"cellular clusters of globally connected high-service enclaves and network ghettos\" driven by electronic networks that segregate as much as they connect. Dominique Lorrain argues that the process of splintering urbanism began towards the end of the 20th century with the emergence of the gigacity, a new form of a networked city characterised by three-dimensional size, network density and the blurring of city boundaries.Graham, Stephen, and Marvin, Simon (2001).

Thus there are perspectives that see urbicide as part of broader imperialist goals, for example in the elimination of cities by Communist Cambodia. Writers and  geographers such as Mike Davis, Nurhan Abujidi and Stephen Graham represent some of these currents. The Nazis' deliberate destruction of Warsaw, as well as the Siege of Sarajevo, which led to the \"coining\" of the most current and popular definition of urbicide, stand as the most symbolic historical events representative of urbicide. Recent events in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Zimbabwe, post-Katrina New Orleans, and Iraq also stand as significant urbicidal examples, and can be taken as a broad spectrum of \"violence against the city,\" indicating the fluidity or multi-faceted discourse of urbicide.", "* Coward, Martin. \"Urbicide in Bosnia,\" in Stephen Graham, ed., Cities, War, and Terrorism: Towards an Urban Geopolitics.
