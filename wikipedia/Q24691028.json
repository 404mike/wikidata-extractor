Its members are Charles Bert (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ethan Jones (bass, keyboards). James Werle played lead guitar until he died in 2018. Kevin Emerson (drums) continues to play on recordings though no longer a full time member of the band. The band has released three EPs and four full-length albums on Santa Barbara-based Matinee Recordings, with UK distribution on Fika Recordings. They are often associated with Australian labelmates The Lucksmiths and twee pop band Tullycraft, and Pitchfork Media described their work as \"music to hold hands to\" after The Lucksmiths' song on the album \"Why That Doesn't Surprise Me\".", "Math and Physics Club began as a basement project for longtime friends Charles Bert (vocals) and James Werle (guitar). Their first release was a digital-only single on Comfort Stand Recordings which featured an early version of the song \"Graduation Day\", along with a b-side titled \"Everybody Lies\". Both songs featured keyboards by early collaborator Andrew Hall, according to the Comfort Stand web site, and who is also credited with playing keyboards on two songs on their first EP, and is credited as a co-writer with the band on the song \"Nothing Really Happened\" on their third EP. By mid-2004, the band's lineup featured Kevin Emerson on drums, Saundrah Humphrey on violin, and Ethan Jones on bass. The band's initial demo attracted the attention of both Jimmy Tassos of Matinee Recordings and the influential KEXP DJ John Richards. As they played their third show in December, they were already receiving considerable attention, including frequent spins on KEXP.", "In September 2005, the band enjoyed playing to a packed crowd at Seattle\u2019s Bumbershoot music festival. Shortly afterward, the band began recording their debut LP Math and Physics Club which was released a year later in October 2006, meriting a favorable review from Pitchfork Media and named \"Best Indie Pop Album of 2006\" by PopMatters. The band's third EP Baby I'm Yours was unveiled on October 1, 2007 with a short tour through southern California. Saundrah left the band in late 2007, and drummer Kevin Emerson left the band officially shortly thereafter, although he has continued to drum on their recordings. In the summer of 2009, they began recording their second full-length album at Jupiter Studios in Seattle with producer Martin Feveyear (Mark Lanegan, Presidents of the USA), which emerged in June 2010 as I Shouldn't Look As Good As I Do. Bassist Ethan Jones toured with indie-rock three-piece Eux Autres briefly between 2010 and early 2011, playing shows supporting Wild Flag on the West Coast of the US, and touring the UK, France and Italy."]}, {"page": "Ethan (given name)", "response": ["*Ethan Jones (footballer) (born 1998), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["|30||Ethan Jones||CF||||Dudley||||1||0||Academy||15 October 2015||Trainee||30 June 2017", "| 15 October 2015 || FW ||  || Ethan Jones || 2 years + 1 year option || 30 June 2017 || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 12 September 2016 || CF ||  || Ethan Jones || Tranmere Rovers || 4 November 2016 || ", "| 3 February 2017 || CF ||  || Ethan Jones || Stourbridge || End of season || ", "| 30 ||  || FW || Ethan Jones|| 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CF ||  || Ethan Jones || Southport || Free || "]}]}}
