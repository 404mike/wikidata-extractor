He is Professor of Archaeology in the Faculty of Science and Technology Bournemouth University in England. Timothy Darvill is recognised as one of the leading authorities on Stonehenge and the British Neolithic. In April 2008 he co-directed excavations within Stonehenge, together with Professor Geoffrey Wainwright and Dr Miles Russell, to examine the early stone structures on the site. The work featured heavily in a BBC Timewatch programme which examined the theory that Stonehenge was a prehistoric centre of healing. He was appointed OBE in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stonehenge", "response": ["Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site.  More recently two major new theories have been proposed. Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Timothy Darvill, of Bournemouth University, have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing\u2014the primeval equivalent of Lourdes. They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves. However, they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well. Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the \"Amesbury Archer\" grew up near the Alpine foothills of Germany; and the \"Boscombe Bowmen\" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.", "Researchers from the Royal College of Art in London have discovered that the monument's igneous bluestones possess \"unusual acoustic properties\" \u2013 when struck they respond with a \"loud clanging noise\". According to the team, this idea could explain why certain bluestones were hauled such a long distance, a major technical accomplishment at the time. In certain ancient cultures, rocks that ring out, known as lithophonic rocks, were believed to contain mystic or healing powers, and Stonehenge has a history of association with rituals. The presence of these \"ringing rocks\" seems to support the hypothesis that Stonehenge was a \"place for healing\", as has been pointed out by Bournemouth University archaeologist Timothy Darvill, who consulted with the researchers. The bluestones of Stonehenge were likely quarried near a town in Wales called Maenclochog, which means \"ringing rock\", where the local bluestones were used as church bells until the 18th century."]}, {"page": "West Kennet Long Barrow", "response": ["West Kennet Long Barrow measures 100 metres in length and 20 metres in width.
