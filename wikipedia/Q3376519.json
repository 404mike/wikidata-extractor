Director Peter Crane began filming material on the production. Many of the early point-of-view shots in the film and the footage at the psychiatric hospital in the beginning of the film were shot by Crane. After several days of shooting, the shooting schedule had already fallen behind, and Crane was fired and replaced with Larry Stewart, who completed the rest of the film. The difference in technique and style between the two directors accounts for slight aesthetic differences from some of the film's earlier footage. "]}]}}
