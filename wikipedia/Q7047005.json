He had been interviewed by the Chaplain-General in April, 1917 who described him as \u2018Nervous, slight stutter, charming fellow\u2019 and noted his experience \u2018In charge of slum church for tenement people; charge of workhouse 2 years; Hospital (Cottage) 9 months\u2019.   Impressed, the Chaplain-General sent him to Eastern Command for a year and then to France. Unfortunately, Hopkins\u2019 health broke down, and he spent weeks in hospital with several problems including pharyngitis and influenza. He was, however, fit to transfer to the RAF in 1918, and was demobilised the following year.\nWhen peace returned he became Chaplain at Ripon College Cuddesdon.  From 1925 to 1933 he was Sacrist of St Paul's Cathedral when he was appointed Provost of Wakefield, a post he held for nearly three decades.
