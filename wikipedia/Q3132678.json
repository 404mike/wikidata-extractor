Previously an actor, he was also a prolific stage director of classical theatre at the Old Vic in the 1930s.In 1923, Lee DeForest filmed Cass for a short film Henry Cass Demonstration Film made in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process. The film was previewed at the Engineers Society of New York on 12 April 1923, and premiered at the Rivoli Theatre in New York on 15 April 1923 with 17 other short Phonofilms.He was married to the actress Joan Hopkins.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "American International Pictures", "response": ["| align=\"right\" rowspan=\"2\" | March 22, 1961 || The Hand || Crime || Henry Cass"]}, {"page": "Blood of the Vampire", "response": ["Blood of the Vampire is a 1958 British colour horror film directed by Henry Cass and starring Donald Wolfit, Barbara Shelley, and Vincent Ball. The film was produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman for Tempean Films, from a screenplay by Jimmy Sangster.", "In summarizing contemporary reviews, film critic Bill Warren writes that \"although the film was popular and still has its adherents, Blood of the Vampire was not greeted by much enthusiasm by film critics, although most thought it somewhat above average\". For example, Charles Stinson of The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"it is gratifying to be able to turn in an on-the-whole good report on the film. It is \"intelligently scripted and well acted by a group of British performers\". Jack Moffitt of The Hollywood Reporter, whom Warren calls \"hard-to-please\", wrote in his review that the film \"rates more serious audience attention than most of the contemporary rash of domestic horror films. Direction by Henry Cass is brisk enough to keep yawning from being contagious to the audience\".", "In Warren's view, \"It's a shade better than some of its class, but the lumpy direction, muddled plot, and slow pace make it look much worse now than it did when it was new ... This is horror by the book, circa 1958, and it's pretty drab ... Cass' direction is, at best, pedestrian, but he probably had little time to do anything\". Taking the opposite view, Meehan says, \"Director Henry Cass moves the plot along vigorously while providing effective gothic atmosphere\". British critic Phil Hardy seems to agree, calling it a \"superior British horror movie\" and \"probably the routine Cass's best movie\".", "Category:Films directed by Henry Cass"]}, {"page": "Phonofilm", "response": ["# Henry Cass Demonstration Film (1923)* also at the Engineers Society Auditorium in NYC on April 12, 1923SilentEra entry"]}, {"page": "Young Wives' Tale", "response": ["Young Wives' Tale, also known as Fun for Four, is a 1951 British comedy film directed by Henry Cass and starring Joan Greenwood, Nigel Patrick, Derek Farr, and Guy Middleton.
