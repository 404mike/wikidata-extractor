Vassall played international rugby for England in the early years of the sport, winning five caps and scoring a hat-trick of tries in the first encounter between England and Wales.\nWhile at Oxford University Vassall led the university rugby side to 70 matches without defeat during his three-year captaincy. His belief that the forward players should work in unison with their backs was revolutionary to the game of rugby and changed the way that rugby was played at club and country level.

His emergence into the top flight was all the more surprising to contemporary commentators because the style of football played at Uppingham School was not \"the Rugby game proper\". Under the captaincy of Vassall, Rotherham was given the leeway to turn the halfback position into a link between forwards and three-quarters, and unlocking the potential for the passing game to be played among the backs, whereas before that date the game was dominated by the forwards and by the practice of hacking. This innovation, and Rotherham in particular, has been attributed with revolutionising the half-back position in rugby. One New Zealand newspaper in a brief obituary to Rotherham reported: \"It is not too much, to say that he entirely revolutionised halfback play, and he particularly introduced the passing game among the backs.\""]}, {"page": "2011 in rugby union", "response": ["** 28 April: Alan Rotherham and Harry Vassall,  (ceremony held at the annual dinner of Oxford University RFC in Oxford)"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*Harry Vassall and Henry Vassall; Harry was Henry's uncle"]}]}}
