Upon his arrival, Cuthbert stated \"The aim is promotion \u2013 I wouldn't have come to this club if I didn't think that was possible.\" He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 season in a 1\u20131 draw with Accrington Stanley. Cuthbert was sent off in second half stoppage time for a professional foul during a 3\u20132 defeat away to Notts County on 12 September. After the departure of Steve McNulty who joined National League club Tranmere Rovers on loan in October, Cuthbert was named temporary club captain, but was only given the role on a permanent basis after Nathan Jones replaced John Still as manager in January 2016. Cuthbert went off injured during a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Stevenage on 2 April, but despite his return to training prior to the penultimate match of the season against Northampton Town on 30 April, he did not add to his tally of 40 appearances during the season."]}, {"page": "McNulty", "response": ["* Steve McNulty, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Barry Cogan (footballer)", "response": ["In June 2008, Grays Athletic announced that Cogan had signed for the club, following a medical examination to test his fitness, on a trial basis. His first goal of the 2008\u201309 campaign came in the home win against Kidderminster Harriers on 7 September 2008, receiving a pass from Jamie Taylor on the right-wing to make the score 3\u20131. Cogan scored in the 47th minute of Grays' 1\u20131 draw against Woking on 18 October. In October 2008, Grays Athletic announced that players had been asked to take a 50% pay cut due to financial difficulties. During the FA Cup Fourth Round Qualifying tie against AFC Totton, Cogan scored a penalty in the 85th minute after Phil Warner handled a cross from Ishmael Welsh. His next goal came almost two months later when he netted both goals in Grays' 2\u20131 victory over Barrow at the New Recreation Ground on 20 December. His first goal of the game came after Barrow's goalkeeper, Alan Martin, spilled a cross from Ishmael Welsh which Cogan pounced on from barely a yard out. In the 56th minute, Cogan had a shot from the edge of the penalty area after out muscling defenders Steve McNulty and Paul Jones. In Grays' next match against Canvey Island in the Essex Senior Cup on 23 December, Cogan scored a late penalty in the 90th minute to equalise the game 2\u20132 and send the game into extra time.  Grays Athletic eventually lost 3\u20132 after extra time. The club released news that the players were again being paid in full and over the \"Christmas period and for January\". On 14 February 2009, Grays travelled to face Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground. He scored to equalise the game at 1\u20131 after the Wrexham goalkeeper struggled with George Beavan's initial shot whilst Cogan scored the rebound. He then set up Grays' second, crossing the ball to Andy Pugh, who scored a consolation goal as Grays lost 3\u20132. He then scored in Grays' 2\u20131 home victory over Altrincham on 7 March. Cogan finished the season as Grays' top goal scorer in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Chester F.C.", "response": ["| align=\"center\" |  Steve McNulty"]}, {"page": "Ritchie Sutton", "response": ["Sutton signed a two-year contract with Tranmere Rovers, newly relegated into the Conference Premier, in May 2015 after impressing manager Gary Brabin with his \"no-nonsense\" defending. He was sent off in a 1\u20131 draw at Welling United on 5 September, though had the red card overturned on appeal. He made 24 appearances in the first half of the campaign, before losing his first team place after Steve McNulty and Michael Ihiekwe formed a centre-back partnership in December. Sutton joined Barrow on loan until the end of the 2015\u201316 season on 4 March 2016. His loan spell at Holker Street was ended early after he suffered a slight hamstring tear in his tenth appearances for the club. Speaking in December 2016, Sutton said new Tranmere boss Micky Mellon had improved his game after playing Sutton in a centre-back partnership alongside Steve McNulty as Tranmere conceded only 16 goals in a run of 24 games. Having scored four goals in 27 games during the 2016\u201317 season, a season cut short due to an Achilles injury, he signed a new two-year contract in May 2017."]}]}}
