It was known as Sanchez Boys and Team Sanchez in the U.S. The performers were the Welshmen Mathew Pritchard, Lee Dainton, Michael \"Pancho\" Locke and the Englishman Dan Joyce and was originally based in Newport, South Wales, but later series of the show took place elsewhere in the United Kingdom and the world. Pritchard and Locke also starred as the \"Pain Men\" in Channel 4's Balls of Steel. The series was similar to the American series Jackass and the Finnish series The Dudesons. The show aired on MTV in the United Kingdom and on MTV2 in the United States.", "Dirty Sanchez consisted of three Welshmen named Mathew Pritchard, Lee Dainton, and Michael \"Pancho\" Locke, and one Englishman Dan Joyce. Pritchard and Dainton became close friends after being in a skateteam together. Dainton bought a videocamera and started filming skate videos with Pritchard. They also participated in various skateboarding competitions where they first met Pancho, and later met Dan. The 4 became close friends and started filming stunts and pranks together for around 18 months. Dainton decided to make a DVD out of it titled Pritchard vs Dainton, which came out in 2001. It was the most popular skateboarding DVD in the United Kingdom. After the executives at MTV UK saw the DVD, they wanted to make a TV show out of it. The original plan for the TV show was that Pritchard, Dainton, Pancho, and Dan traveled through the UK to find \"the most fucked up people\". The Sanchez Boys did not like that idea, but the executives were only interested in the stunts and pranks rather than the skateboarding. The Sanchez Boys then agreed that they would be performing the stunts and pranks themselves. The first series aired in 2003, and became the most popular MTV UK series of all time.
