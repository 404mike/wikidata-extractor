He later represented England at under-20 level. During his four years at Middlesbrough, Graham made just one first team start. He was loaned out to clubs in all three divisions of the Football League, before joining his final loan club Carlisle United on a two-year deal in 2007.\nAt the end of his contract, he joined Championship side Watford, who were subsequently ordered to pay compensation. Graham was Watford's top-scorer in both of his seasons at Vicarage Road, as well as the club's Player of the Season award and the Championship's overall top scorer in the 2010\u201311 season. In July 2011, Graham transferred to newly promoted Premier League team Swansea City for \u00a33.5 million, where in his first season he was their top goalscorer with 12 league goals. In January 2013, he moved to Sunderland, but his stint at the Wearside club was mixed; his first and only goal came over two years after his arrival, and he was often loaned out to other clubs. He was released in June 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 12", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Danny Graham, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Chester-le-Street", "response": ["* Danny Graham, footballer"]}, {"page": "Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "response": ["|2018\u201319|| Danny Graham"]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Former Middlesbrough defender Craig Harrison was appointed as manager ahead of Hartlepool's first campaign in non-league. Hartlepool started the 2017\u201318 season with just one win from seven attempts. However, a win at Guiseley kick-started a run of only one defeat in thirteen matches. By November, off-field financial issues intensified which coincided with a winless run of eleven games. In a statement, Pam Duxbury (then chairwoman) claimed that a number of \"legacy issues have consumed high financial and human resources\" and that the club needed \u00a3200,000 in order to survive. In response to the financial issues, fans set up a JustGiving page which raised just over \u00a385,000, including donations from supporters across the UK and a \u00a32,500 boost by the former Middlesbrough striker Danny Graham. An initiative called 'Save Pools Day' took place on 20 January 2018 for a fixture against Wrexham where supporters from other clubs visited to raise funds via ticket sales. Hartlepool lost 2\u20130 with 6,833 supporters in attendance. The poor run of form resulted in the sacking of Craig Harrison in February who was replaced by caretaker manager Matthew Bates. Bates' first win came on 21 March during the televised away fixture at Barrow. During this match, Hartlepool went 1\u20130 down and briefly fell into the relegation places. Hartlepool won three consecutive matches to pull away from the relegation places and finally guaranteed safety from relegation on 17 April with a win against Leyton Orient. Hartlepool's first season in non-league ended with the club avoiding liquidation when Raj Singh bought the club in April. Hartlepool ultimately finished a turbulent season in 15th place."]}, {"page": "Swansea City A.F.C.", "response": ["By being promoted to the Premier League for the 2011\u201312 season, Swansea became the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992.

Swansea finished their debut Premier League season in 11th, but at the end of the season Brendan Rodgers left to manage Liverpool.
