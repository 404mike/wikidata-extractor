The York City goalkeeper Dean Kiely made a number of saves in the first half, including two shots from David Adekola and a header from Liam Robinson.  After Kiely had made further saves from both Roger Stanislaus and Derek Ward, his Bury counterpart Gary Kelly twice prevented Paul Barnes from scoring and the match ended 0\u20130.  The second leg took place three days later at Bootham Crescent in York.
