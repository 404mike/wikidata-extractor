The colony's first parliament passed a resolution in 1860 favouring direct connection with England via the Torres Strait. In December 1861, Sir George Ferguson Bowen (1821\u201399), Governor of Queensland (1859\u201367), described the necessity for a station in the far north of Queensland. From a naval and military point of view, a post at or near Cape York would be valuable, due to the establishment of a French colony and naval station in New Caledonia. Bowen informed Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the government of Queensland would be willing to undertake the formation and management of a station at Cape York and to support a civil establishment there.C G Austin, \"Early History of Somerset and Thursday Island\", Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Volume 4, issue 2, Brisbane 1949, p. 217."]}]}}
