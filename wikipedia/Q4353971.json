The first half of the season continued spectacularly for the Hitmen, winning their next four games on the bounce, demolishing Ventura County Fusion and Bakersfield Brigade 4\u20130 each, and not conceding a goal until their topsy-turvy 4\u20133 victory over Ogden Outlaws in mid-May. During the early part of the season, Hollywood negotiated a deal with Los Angeles Galaxy whereby some of the MLS team's fringe players would join the Hitmen on loan to keep up their match fitness levels, following the demise of the MLS Reserve Division; Tristan Bowen, Leonard Griffin, Kyle Patterson and Israel Sesay all contributed to the Hollywood cause with several goals and assists during their spells. They suffered their first defeat 1\u20130 away to BYU Cougars, and endured a rocky spell in June when they went three games without a win, but bounced back to demolish Ogden 7\u20133 at home thanks to a brace from striker Jaime Chavez. Halfway through the season head coach Michael Erush left the team to take up a coaching position with the US national soccer team competing at the 2009 Maccabiah Games in Israel; his position as head coach was taken over by his assistant, Mat Herold. Despite being involved in an astonishing 0\u20130 tie with the Los Angeles Legends in early July in which seven players were shown red cards, Hollywood wrapped up the Southwest Division title with a 3\u20132 come-from-behind victory over the Southern California Seahorses, and secured a bye to the final of the divisional playoffs. Unfortunately, the Hitmen were unexpectedly dropped 3\u20131 by Ventura County Fusion in extra time, and had to be content with nothing more than the divisional title in their first year in PDL competition. Jaime Chavez was Hollywood's top scorer, with 10 goals, while both Nick Kohlschreiber and Armando Ochoa contributed three assists each.", "*  Kyle Patterson"]}, {"page": "2009 Los Angeles Galaxy season", "response": ["|Kyle Patterson || M || #48 (4th) || Saint Louis UniversitySt. Louis Lions", "| ||30 ||align=left|PattersonKyle Patterson"]}, {"page": "2009 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Kyle Patterson||Donovan Ricketts||"]}, {"page": "All-time Hollywood United Hitmen roster", "response": ["*  Kyle Patterson"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Allsvenskan players", "response": ["*Kyle Patterson \u2013 GAIS \u2013 2010"]}, {"page": "Kyle (given name)", "response": ["*Kyle Patterson (born 1986), English footballer "]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Kyle Patterson \u2013 TP-47 \u2013 2005"]}]}}
