A self-confessed \"miserable bastard\", he is always tricking people into giving him free belongings or buying him a drink, and is known for his unapologetic greed. (In Scottish patois, \"miserable\" is equated with \"miserly\", \"thrifty\", or \"stingy\", not \"sad\" or \"mean\" as in many other cultures.) Tam enters competitions to get hold of free goods (which, much to the others' annoyance, he always wins), and in some episodes appears to be almost delirious at the thought of getting freebies. He married the local librarian, Frances Drummond, in the episode \"Ring.\" His materialistic attitude often causes a rift between himself and his wife, but at 70, Tam became father to Tam Junior and Frances became Britain's oldest mum. Tam is a DJ at the Western General Hospital and often manages to con the terminally ill out of their valuable possessions. He tends to be Winston's 'double act' partner, and Winston is the best man at Tam and Frances\u2019 wedding. Tam occasionally demonstrates a more generous side. For example, in the two-part episode \"Dead Leg\", Tam fakes his death in order to use his life insurance money to pay for Winston to go to Switzerland to save his remaining leg, which was due to be amputated."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish actors", "response": ["*Mark Cox (born 1972)"]}, {"page": "Mark Cox", "response": ["Mark Cox may refer to:", "*Mark Cox (tennis) (born 1943), British tennis player", "*Mark Cox (poet) (born 1956), American poet", "*Mark Cox (rugby league) (born 1978), English rugby league player", "*Mark Cox (actor) (born 1972), Scottish comedian and actor", "*Mark Cox, Jr. (1905\u20131979), English cricketer", "*Mark Cox (cricketer) (1879\u20131968), English cricketer", "*John Mark Cox Jr., first African American to attend Rollins College"]}, {"page": "Having It All (radio programme)", "response": ["The plot of \"having it all\" revolves around Debbie (Michelle Gomez), her family - her teenage daughter named Lucy (Ellie Bird) and her ten-year-old son Oliver (Michael Kelly), and her friends - Janice (Cora Bissett) and Martin (Mark Cox).", "* Multiple Roles - Mark Cox"]}, {"page": "Shetland (TV series)", "response": ["*Mark Cox as Tommy Monro"]}, {"page": "List of Outlander characters", "response": ["* Mark Cox as Reverend Caldwell"]}, {"page": "Beatrice Colin", "response": ["| Liam Brennan, Deirdre Davis, Anne Kristen, Louise Ironside, Mark Cox, Margaret Clark and Owen Kavanagh"]}]}}
