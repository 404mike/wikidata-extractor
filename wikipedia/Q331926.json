He is currently a coach at Dover Athletic.\nRidgewell, who earned eight caps for England at under-21 level, began his senior career with Aston Villa. He spent time on loan at AFC Bournemouth in 2002, before moving to Villa's local rivals Birmingham City in 2007, where he was part of the 2011 Football League Cup Final-winning team. He played for two and a half seasons with West Bromwich Albion, who released him at the end of 2013\u201314. He then joined the Portland Timbers, whom he captained to victory in MLS Cup 2015. During the MLS off-season, he spent time on loan in England with Wigan Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion.

In the return, Caldwell helped the club beat Nacional 3\u20130 advance to the Group Stage. Since making his debut for Birmingham City, he quickly became a first team regular, forming a centre\u2013back partnership with Curtis Davies. Caldwell then helped the club keep four consecutive clean sheets between 16 October 2011 and 29 October 2011. His performance was praised by Manager Chris Hughton for his dedication and commitment to the team. In return, he praised his philosophy, comparing it to his former manager Owen Coyle and even going far as to say \"the best sort of manager to play for\". Caldwell also captained Birmingham City's matches in the UEFA Europa League group stage, as they were eliminated. He successfully predicted that if the club failed to qualify for the Europa League knockout stage, it would be a disappointment. Once again, Caldwell helped the club keep four consecutive clean sheets between 14 January 2012 and 28 January 2012. In the absent of Stephen Carr and Liam Ridgewell, he captained Birmingham City for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season. Caldwell stated on two occasions that the club can win the promotion back to the Premier League. However in a match against Ipswich Town on 17 April 2012, he suffered a groin injury and was substituted in the 35th minute, as Birmingham City drew 1\u20131. After the match, it was announced that Caldwell was sidelined for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season. He previously missed a match against Watford on 28 August 2011. Caldwell's groin injury was considered to be a loss among the club's supporters, considering his contribution he has done this season so far. However in his absent, Birmingham City lost 3\u20132 against Blackpool in the semi\u2013finals of the Championship play\u2013offs.
