In May 1951 an interdenominational Christian rally was held in nearby Hyde Park to coincide with the launch of the Festival of Britain. A number of Anglo-Catholic clergy and lay people, led by Rev. Hugh Ross Williamson, held a protest meeting at the Annunciation Church to express their opposition to Bishops of the Church of England sharing a platform with Methodists, Baptists and other Non-Conformist churches, organisations which, in their opinion, did \"not accept the traditional Faith of the Church\". In a signed letter, they expressed the concern that \"the participation of the Church of England may give the additional impression that Roman Catholics are the only religious body which defend the full Catholic Faith.\" The poet John Betjeman was among the signatories; although he admitted to T. S. Eliot (a fellow Anglo-Catholic and a churchwarden of St Stephen's, Gloucester Road) that he found the tone of the protest \"somewhat extreme\", he nevertheless declared \"I have nailed my colours to the mast and cannot let down my co-signatories.\" Rose Macaulay, a novelist, also commented on the protest at the Annunciation, expressing dismay at opposition to the rally."]}, {"page": "Now (1940\u20131947 magazine)", "response": ["In his reply to George Orwell's \"London Letter\", published in the March\u2013April 1942 issue of Partisan Review, in which Orwell had mentioned NOW as an example of publications that published contributions by both pacificts and Fascists,Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.)

An inheritance enabled him to subsidise himself to write poetry, and in 1939 the Hogarth Press chose him as one of their Poets of Tomorrow. Erica Marx\u2019s Hand and Flower Press published his long poem The Two Natures in 1951. During this period, influenced by Stapledon, he began to write on agriculture and ecology. His dissatisfaction with the BBC took satirical form in his 1956 novel Shadow of Authority. On Stapledon\u2019s death in 1960 Waller became his literary executor, writing the biography Prophet of the New Age (1962) and then editing, and providing a long introduction to, Stapledon\u2019s unpublished notes on environmentalism, Human Ecology. Waller\u2019s attempt at summing up his own philosophy, Be Human or Die (1973), though not without interest, is over-ambitious and perhaps reflects the confusion of his domestic life at the time he was drafting it. In 1992 he published an autobiographical collection The Pilgrimage of Eros, which covered his pre-war life.

In it she refers to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds directly and includes pictures of two Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed-related installations she did in Haifa. She says:In the West, we do not consider religion as an integral part of life, probably because our scientific education makes it impossible for us to accept reasonably the dogmatic theories or orthodoxies which narrow men's thirst for the infinite down to their own particular measurements. The message of the Bahai[sic] Revelation which came through the Persian prophet Baha'ullah[sic] (1866) is most in keeping with our modern outlook, since its fundamentals enjoin the union of Religion with science, universal religious tolerance, international parliaments and the absolute equality of men and women. She had constructed a portable version of the Irwin Colour Filter specifically for use at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Shrines she named \"The Gate\". She also included an outdoor picture uphill towards the front of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b as it stood in April 1930 with lighting she supplied,(though the picture itself as published in the book was black-and-white.) She also speaks of the difficulties of the burgeoning field of illumination saying \"I voice the feeling of many comrade and creative engineers when I say that the art of illumination cannot come into robust existence until the Illuminating Specialist is recognized as an independent authority, whose scheme, though co-operative, is based upon a deeper and more detailed study of Colour and Light than architects or decorators usually have time to afford to these subjects. The public is gradually awakening to this fact, though its own limited idea that Architecture and Decoration are fine arts, whereas illumination is a mere mechanical necessity, is largely responsible for the present situation.\" It was commented on by Hugh Ross Williamson in January 1931 noting Irwin's color illumination technology had been used in \u201cmasonic lodges in California, to Bahai[sic] shrines in Palestine, and elsewhere\u201d. In November she was noted in the journal Nature giving a talk for the Electrical Association for Women in New York; she also aided founding a chapter in England."]}]}}
