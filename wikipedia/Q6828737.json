At the age of 17, he joined Conference National club Crawley Town on a work experience loan during the latter stages of 2005\u201306 season. Bostwick played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007. He was told he was surplus to requirements at the club and subsequently signed for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract, where he played eight matches before being released by Rushden at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. He joined Ebbsfleet United in August 2007 ahead of the 2007\u201308 season, helping Ebbsfleet win the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. \nBostwick rejected a contract offer from Ebbsfleet, and signed for Stevenage Borough shortly after the FA Trophy success. He played regularly in the club's defence and midfield throughout his time at Stevenage, winning the FA Trophy once again in May 2009 and helping the club earn back-to-back promotions from the Conference Premier into League One. After four years at Stevenage, Bostwick signed for Championship club Peterborough United in July 2012, where he spent five seasons; playing 228 times and helping the club win the Football League Trophy in 2014. He then joined Lincoln City ahead of the 2017\u201318 season, winning the EFL Trophy in 2018 before being named the club's Player of the Year as they finished the 2018\u201319 season as League Two champions.

A month later, on 4 September 2010, he started his first game of the season, against Crewe Alexandra, but was sent-off in the 63rd minute of the match for two bookable offences. He remained a regular starter throughout the remainder of 2010, scoring his first goal of the season in a 1\u20131 home draw against Shrewsbury Town on 23 November 2010. He scored in Stevenage's 3\u20131 win over Premier League club Newcastle United on 8 January 2011. Long's shot from 25-yards out resulted in Stevenage's first goal, also providing the assist for Michael Bostwick's goal in the same game. Long played 30 games during the 2010\u201311 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010\u201311 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish.

On his next appearance, ten days later, he scored the first goal of the campaign in a 3\u20131 away victory against AFC Bournemouth. Reid scored twice for Stevenage in a 4\u20132 home win against Rochdale on 3 September. His first goal, from Lawrie Wilson's knockdown, opened the scoring, and his secondStevenage's fourthwas widely reported as a Neal Trotman own goal, although it was attributed by Stevenage's website to Reid, who \"managed to nip between the two defenders and just poke the ball into the net\". His fourth goal in five games was Stevenage's first in a 5\u20131 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 13 September 2011; he reacted quickest to a parried Michael Bostwick shot and scored from six yards out. He suffered a groin injury in November 2011 which required surgery, and he had a successful operation in January 2012. Reid returned to first-team action on 28 February, after three-and-a-half months out; he played the first 74 minutes of a 2\u20132 draw with Huddersfield Town.

He signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011. Two weeks later, Roberts scored his first competitive goal of the season in Stevenage's 1\u20131 away draw against Oldham Athletic on 10 September 2011. Roberts' goal came in the fourth minute of the match, heading in Michael Bostwick's shot to give Stevenage the lead. His second goal of the season came in the club's exit from the Football League Trophy on 4 October, with Roberts scoring a 20-yard volley in injury-time to take the game to penalties, which Stevenage subsequently lost 4\u20133. He described the volley as \"easily the best goal of his career\". Following Graham Westley's departure to Preston North End on 13 January 2012, Roberts was made player-manager for Stevenage's away match to Rochdale on 14 January 2012, with the club securing a 5\u20131 victory at Spotland. He remained in the position for two further matches, a 1\u20131 draw at Scunthorpe United, and a 4\u20132 home victory against Milton Keynes Dons, until the appointment of manager Gary Smith allowed Roberts to concentrate on the playing side of the game. He scored in successive games towards the latter stages of the season; a late equaliser against Preston North End, as well as the fifth goal in the club's 6\u20130 away victory against Yeovil Town on 14 April 2012. Roberts played every minute of Stevenage's 56 games during the season, scoring seven goals from defence, with the club losing out in the play-off semi-finals. Stevenage also progressed to the Fifth Round of the FA Cup that season, the furthest the club had reached in the competition; with Roberts playing in all six cup matches, including two matches against Tottenham Hotspur as the team took the Premier League club to a replay. He was also named as Stevenage's Player of the Year at the end of the season, becoming only the third player to win the award twice."]}]}}
