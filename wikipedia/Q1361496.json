Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it.\" Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that \"the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it\".Penney, Manchester City: The Mercer-Allison Years, p. 11. As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6\u20133 victory over England in 1953."]}, {"page": "Colin Bell", "response": ["In the 1967\u201368 season, Bell helped City win their second League Championship (they had won their first in 1937).

Mike Summerbee, Tony Coleman and Neil Young scored City's other goals while Jimmy Greaves scored the goal for Spurs. After the game, legendary centre forward Dixie Dean informed Allison that the City team which had beaten Spurs was \"the most brilliant side I have ever seen\". In the penultimate game of the season, Bell scored twice in a 3\u20131 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. In the game, Lee and Summerbee stretched the Spurs defence allowing Bell a clear run at a slowing Dave Mackay which overwhelmed the Scotsman.

In the 1969\u201370 season, Bell scored eleven league goals for City, who finished tenth in the league.

Lee had the first chance of the match, a close range shot which was saved by Kostka. Manchester City took the lead in the 12th minute. Lee cut in from the left wing, escaping a tackle from Alfred Olek, and struck a fierce shot.Gardner, The Manchester City Football Book No. 2, p. 20. Goalkeeper Hubert Kostka parried the ball, only for it to land at the feet of Neil Young for a simple finish.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 66.

Manchester City played on with ten men for a period as Doyle received treatment from trainer Dave Ewing, but the defender was unable to continue.

Shortly before half-time, Young won the ball after loose play from Florenski, which put him clear on goal. As Young moved into the penalty area Kostka rushed out of his goal and upended him, leaving the referee no option but to give a penalty.
