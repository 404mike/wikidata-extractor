Rangers employed an attacking line up and had a two-goal lead by half time. The first was scored by forward Colin Stein with the assist provided by Dave Smith.  The second was scored by Willie Johnston after he headed in a Dave Smith pass with six minutes to go before half time.  Rangers went 3\u20130 up minutes into the second half as Willie Johnston scored his second after a long kick out by goalkeeper Peter McCloy. Dynamo Moscow came back into the match when with thirty minutes left for play Eshtrekov scored after a defensive mistake from the Rangers back line. Dynamo continued to pressure however the Rangers keeper Peter McCloy twice made fine saves from Gershkovich and Sandy Jardine cleared off the line from Evryuzhihin. Moscow found their second with three minutes left with a goal from Makhovikov. Rangers held on to secure their only trophy in Europe in front of almost 25,000 people, albeit there was no award ceremony in the stadium due to the Rangers fans pitch invasion.", "|GK ||1 || Peter McCloy"]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["Billy McNeill (nicknamed \"Cesar\") the former player and captain of The Lisbon Lions, took over as manager in August 1978.  The return from injury of Danny McGrain and shrewd signings such as winger Davie Provan and midfielder Murdo MacLeod helped McNeill strengthen a Celtic side that had finished fifth in the league previous season.  In May 1979 Celtic's final league fixture was an Old Firm fixture against Rangers at Parkhead.  A win would clinch the 1978\u201379 league title for Celtic, but any other result would leave Rangers as favourites for the league as they had two additional games to play.  Celtic attacked from the start but trailed 1\u20130 at half-time through an Alex MacDonald goal for Rangers.  Johnny Doyle was then sent-off in the second half, leaving Celtic a man down as well as a goal down.  Celtic though, responded in exhilarating style through goals from Roy Aitken and George McCluskey to go 2\u20131 ahead. Celtic's lead only lasted a couple of minutes, Bobby Russell equalising with a fine strike.  As the game neared the end, and with Celtic attacking relentlessly, a McCluskey cross was parried by Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy against one of his own defenders, Colin Jackson, and then rebounded back into the goal to put Celtic 3\u20132 ahead.  In the final minute Murdo MacLeod put the matter beyond doubt when he hammered home a powerful 20 yard strike to secure a 4\u20132 win on the night and clinch the title in the most dramatic of circumstances."]}]}}
