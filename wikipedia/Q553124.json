As his biographer R. A. Gilbert described him, \"Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western occultism\u2014viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
