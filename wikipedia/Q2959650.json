In its early years, the reviewers included Edmund Gosse, George Saintsbury, and Henry Sidgwick. As a general rule, The Academy did not publish signed reviews. After its purchase by John Morgan Richards in 1896, the periodical published lighter farehistory of The Academy from conradfirst.net under the editorship of Charles Lewis Hind. The editors for The Academy were: Charles Appleton (1869\u201378), Charles Doble (1878\u201380), James S. Cotton (1881\u201396), and C. Lewis Hind (1896\u20131903, including his editorship of The Academy and Literature). Henry Bradley served as temporary editor for a portion of 1884\u201385."]}]}}
