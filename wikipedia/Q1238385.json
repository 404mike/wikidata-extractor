He became a naturalised citizen in 1872.Biliotti was also an accomplished archaeologist who conducted important excavations at sites in the Aegean, western Anatolia, and eastern Anatolia. He was made a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George in October 1898. Biliotti's despatches, though written in slightly poor English, are recognized as being of major value for 21st century scholars in fields as different as diplomatic history, anthropology, and of course archaeology.He served as British vice-consul at Rhodes and was transferred to Trebizond in 1873; later he was consul at Chania (Crete) and consul-general at Salonica. His service in Crete covered the period of the revolutionary movements of 1889, 1895 and 1897, in all of which Britain was concerned as one of the Great Powers. His service at Salonica saw the beginnings of the guerilla warfare which would eventually lead to the Balkan Wars.\nHe excavated at Camirus (1858\u20131865), Ialysus (1868\u20131870), Satala (1874) and Cirisli Tepe (1883). Many of his finds are now displayed or stored at the British Museum.The Biliotti family mausoleum is in the Catholic Cemetery on Rhodes, a few 100 metres from the sea and near the busy Saturday market.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aegean civilization", "response": ["Meanwhile, in 1868, tombs at Ialysus in Rhodes had yielded to Alfred Biliotti many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth \"Mycenaean\"; but these, bought by John Ruskin, and presented to the British Museum, excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date.

According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents,David Barchard, The Fearless and Self-Reliant Servant: The Life and Career of Sir Alfred Biliotti (1833-1895), p.50 starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers,;  but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani (today Vasiliada, Greece), which was an Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands.The Macedonian question, 1893-1908, from Western sources; Nadine Lange-Akhund; 1998 p.279"]}, {"page": "Felix von Luschan", "response": ["In 1881 Luschan and Otto Benndorf explored the ancient Lycian region of southern Anatolia, part of the Ottoman Empire, where they excavated the Heroon of Trysa near Myra, which is now on display at the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum.

Although Sadagh was assumed by Taylor to be the site of Satala, and indicated as such by Kiepert in his maps,Vincent Yorke, \"A Journey in the Valley of the Upper Euphrates\" in Geographical Journal, Vol VIII, 1896, p461. the site's identification as Satala was not conclusively established until 1894 when two British scholars, Vincent Yorke and D.

Unfortunately, the letter was intercepted at Livissi by Turkish authorities. Later that same year, many families of Livissi were deported and driven on foot to Denizli, around 220\u00a0km away.

Stopping for the night at Selino Kasteli, the expedition came under fire by Christian insurgents besieging two small Ottoman redoubts outside the village, but a Russian field gun drove them off. The expedition relieved one of the redoubts overnight. On the morning of 9 March, Christian insurgents again opened fire, but the expedition's artillery ashore and gunfire by International Squadron warships in the bay silenced them.

The expedition suffered no casualties among its European personnel or the Ottoman soldiers it rescued, and only one Muslim civilian was wounded during the four-day operation.
