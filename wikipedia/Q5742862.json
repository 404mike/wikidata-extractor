To realise this purpose the community needed a proper church and on St Mary Magdalen's Day, 22 July 1911, the foundation stone of a great church was laid.

As a part of his monastic studies Walter Frere had visited Roman Catholic clergy and monasteries in France before he joined the community. In 1928 he became the first Anglican president of the Fellowship of St Alban and St Sergius after a visit to Russia in 1909. Strong links to Roman Catholics and Orthodox have remained in CR and has become even stronger in the age of globalism. On the initiative of the Roman Catholic Benedictine abbey of Trier in Germany, an official friendship, which grew from several visits, was made in 1983, and several brethren have built up links with the Orthodox Church in Romania in a mutual spiritual exchange.

Research by the Penwith History Group has found that the earliest reference to Bridget \u2033of Sweden\u2033 is an April 1928 article in The Cornishman newspaper by Canon Jennings, the vicar of Madron with Morvah and repeated by Walter Frere, the Bishop of Truro on the centenary of the rebuilding of the church in August 1928. A chapel of St Bridget, probably at Morvah, was mentioned in 1390, a year before St Bridget of Sweden (died 1371) was canonised. There is a pattern of churches along the coast being dedicated to Irish saints and it is likely that the St Bridget at Morvah refers to an Irish saint. One such saint is Brigid of Kildare who died in 525 and named after a pagan Irish goddess who seemed to be an important figure in the Celtic church. Further evidence for an Irish connection was the feast of Lughnasa (now Lammas), an Irish pagan festival held on the first Sunday in August until the mid 1800s.
