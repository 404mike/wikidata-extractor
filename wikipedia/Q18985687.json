In 1918, she began work at Kew Garden in London, England as an assistant to Dr. Otto Knapf. During this time, she also studied botany at the University of London, becoming an expert in grasses. In July 1923, she accepted an invitation from Agnes Chase to join the staff of the United States National Herbarium in the Office of Foreign Plant Introduction. She conducted numerous studies of cultivated bamboo. Through her work in Washington, D.C. she met the agricultural explorer and tropical fruit expert, Wilson Popenoe. They married on November 17, 1923. In 1925, her husband accepted a position with the United Fruit Company as the director of agricultural experiments and moved the family to Tela on the Atlantic Coast of Honduras.\nWhile in Honduras, Popenoe developed an interest in archaeology and worked on several Honduran archaeological sites including in the Maya fortress of Tenampa in 1927 and Cerro Palenque. Between 1928 and 1932 she excavated in the pre-Columbian cemetery at Playa de los Muertos.\nHowever she could not complete her work because in December 1932, she ate an unripe, uncooked akee fruit, which is believed to have poisoned her and as a result she died.\nThe results of her excavations at Playas de los Muertos were published posthumously in 1934.

Latin American Antiquity 12(1): 5-23. however it has \"had a continuous history going back as early as any sedentary society yet documented in Mesoamerica\". Thought to at one time have been a village, Playa de los Muertos is primarily known through its burials and ceramics. Archaeologists have identified a strong Aztec and Mayan influence on the early inhabitants at Playa de los Muertos, however it is considered a distinct culture. The site is most notable for its finely made ceramic figurines, famously excavated by Dorothy Popenoe. These figurines, in particular those depicting the female form, have helped archaeologists interpret gender roles at the site.Joyce, Rosemary A. 1993 Women's Work: Images of Production and Reproduction in Pre-Hispanic Southern Central America. Current Anthropology 34 (3): 255-274 Archaeologists believe that people at Playa de los Muertos likely participated in long-distance trade networks which reach from Guatemala to the Gulf Coast Olmec centers.", "Then in 1928, Dorothy Popenoe commenced excavations at the site. Popenoe's excavations centered on the cemeteries located at Playa de los Muertos. Many of the pots and figurines recovered centre around gender roles and how the female form was depicted. During excavations, Popenoe drew sketches of artifacts and of the site as she excavated. The excavations were focused on the cemeteries and in particular the grave goods that were stored with the bodies. These excavations unearthed many pots, clay figurines and animal bones. The high number of animal bones has led researchers to believe that Playa de los Muertos was at least partially supported through hunting. Of the many potsherds and figurines that have been excavated, a large number depict females and distinct female sexual characteristics. Many of the figurines are depicted with; little clothing, sit cross-legged with one knee drawn up, and distinct sexual characteristics are visible.Joyce, Rosemary A. 1993 Women's Work: Images of Production and Reproduction in Pre-Hispanic Southern Central America.
