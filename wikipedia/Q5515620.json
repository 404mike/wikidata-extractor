In 1947 she became editor of the Poetry Review. This position made Spark one of the only female editors of the time. Spark left the Poetry Review in 1948. In 1953 Muriel Spark was baptized in the Church of England but in 1954 she decided to join the Roman Catholic Church, which she considered crucial in her development toward becoming a novelist. Penelope Fitzgerald, a fellow novelist and contemporary of Spark, wrote that Spark \"had pointed out that it wasn't until she became a Roman Catholic ... that she was able to see human existence as a whole, as a novelist needs to do\".. In an interview with John Tusa on BBC Radio 4, she said of her conversion and its effect on her writing that she \"was just a little worried, tentative. Would it be right, would it not be right? Can I write a novel about that \u2013 would it be foolish, wouldn't it be? And somehow with my religion \u2013 whether one has anything to do with the other, I don't know \u2013 but it does seem so, that I just gained confidence.\" Graham Greene, Gabriel Fielding and Evelyn Waugh supported her in her decision."]}, {"page": "Llangefni", "response": ["* Gabriel Fielding, author, attended Llangefni County School, in 1934"]}, {"page": "Michael Barnsley", "response": ["Michael Barnsley is the son of author Gabriel Fielding (Alan Fielding Barnsley) and a descendant of Henry Fielding."]}, {"page": "Paul Scott (novelist)", "response": ["While Scott was teaching creative writing at the University of Tulsa in 1976, he arranged to sell his private correspondence to that university's McFarlin Library, thus making available some 6000 personal letters.
