Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops. In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophecies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse."]}, {"page": "September 24", "response": ["*  1950   \u2013 Harriet Walter, English actress"]}, {"page": "Christopher Lee", "response": ["Lee was introduced to Danish painter and former model Birgit \"Gitte\" Kr\u00f8ncke by a Danish friend in 1960.
