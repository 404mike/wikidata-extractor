He scored two goals that season, including a goal against Premier League champions Chelsea in the League Cup fourth round. He dedicated the goal to his late grandad, who had passed away hours before. In March 2016, he signed a two-year extension to his contract to keep him at the club until summer 2018. Interim manager Jon Whitney stated that \"he's been one of our most consistent performers this year and his experience is invaluable, on and off the pitch\". Walsall struggled at the start of the 2016\u201317 season, before a switch to a 3\u20135\u20132 formation helped to shore up the defence.

But Osbourne returned to the first team from injury, appearing twice as an unused substitute. Following this, he was invited back to attend Walsall's pre-season training, in order to be assessed.
