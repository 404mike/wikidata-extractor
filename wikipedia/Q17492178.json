The music makes use of pentatonic scales and numerous melodic and rhythmic allusions to Irish traditional music, but only once quotes from an original Irish lament in a tune Butler claimed he had known from his childhood.See published score of Muirgheis, p. 170; quoted in Klein (1996), p. 150.

The vocal score of 1910, published by Breitkop and Hartel contains both the English libretto and Irish translation. As the opera was only performed in 1903, using the English libretto, the first opera to be performed in the Irish language was actually Eithne (1909) by Robert O'Dwyer."]}, {"page": "Chronological list of Irish classical composers", "response": ["* Robert O'Dwyer (1862\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "O'Dwyer, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert O'Dwyer"]}]}}
