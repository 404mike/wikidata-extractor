According to Twyne, Camden promised this to him in a conversation in 1623, and a patent sealed by Camden in March of that year to this effect was read out to the university's governing body in January 1624. Camden, however, wrote to Wheare shortly after the patent was signed and said that he had been tricked by some \"foul play\" and did not intend to appoint Twyne. In the end, Twyne died three years before Wheare.Gibson, pp. 101\u2013102.
