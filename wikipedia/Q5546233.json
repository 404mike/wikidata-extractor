Whitmore also transformed the auditorium to the oval shape that it has today. Further alterations were made in 1844, when the Manoel's set designer, Ercolani, repainted the panels on the wooden boxes and had them gilded. Another stratum of silver leaf was added to the panels and ceiling in 1906. Throughout this time, the Teatro Reale was rented out to professional impresarios, who hosted nine-month opera seasons. It was visited by many foreign dignitaries, including Sir Walter Scott, and H.M. Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager, widow of William IV of the United Kingdom, who attended performances of Elisir d'Amore and Gemma di Vergy at the theatre, during her convalescence in Malta. Lucia di Lammermoor was given as a gala night in honour of the Queen Dowager, featuring soprano Camilla Darbois.Rolandi, Ulderico, \"Musica e Musicisti in Malta\", in Archivio Storico di Malta, Vol. I, Fasc.

On the request of the British Royal Navy to the Governor the site was handed over in 1830 to build the Royal Navy Bighi Hospital. The building was designed by the eldest son of Saverio Scerri. The building cost roughly \u00a320,000 and started operating in 1832. It accommodated 200 beds and it roughly gave service to 800 navy sailors per year. The design of Bighi Hospital is generally attributed to Colonel (later Major General) Sir George Whitmore (1775\u20131862) who headed the Royal Engineers between 1811 and 1829. The foundation stone was laid by Vice Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm on 23 March 1830. The works were completed on 24 September 1832, at a total cost of \u00a320,000. The West and East Wings' architecture is in the modern Doric style and built with high floors. The hospital has three separate building and are known as Villa Bighi.

This gate is commonly attributed to Giorgio Pullicino, who was the professor of architecture at the University at the time.

The  Maltese craftsmen also supervised the construction of public buildings, cisterns and fortifications in Corfu town. The Maitland Monument (Rotunda) was also built in Maltese limestone in 1821.
