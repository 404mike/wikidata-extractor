He was born at Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham.\nHutton made his debut for Durham in the 1991 Minor Counties Championship, playing in three matches in the competition, against Northumberland, Norfolk and Suffolk.  He recorded two half centuries in these matches.  He was one of the few players retained by Durham who had played minor counties cricket following their elevation to first-class status for the 1992 season.  He made his first-class debut midway through that season against Essex in the County Championship.  He made eight first-class appearances in that season, scoring 406 runs at an average of 27.06.  He made two half centuries, with his highest score of 78 coming in his second match against Sussex at Horsham.  He also made his List A debut in that season against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in the Sunday League.  He made two further appearances in that format in 1992, against Glamorgan and Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Durham first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 1st || 334* ||  Stewart Hutton Mike Roseberry || v Oxford University || Oxford || 1996", "| 3rd || 205 ||  Graeme Fowler Stewart Hutton || v Yorkshire || Leeds || 1993"]}, {"page": "List of Durham List A cricket records", "response": ["| 1st || 255 ||  Mike Roseberry Stewart Hutton || v Herefordshire || Chester-le-Street\u00b9 || 1995", "| 4th || 166 ||  Stewart Hutton Phil Bainbridge || v Wiltshire || Trowbridge || 1993"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["Durham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins  (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs."]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Stewart Hutton (1991\u20131998) : S. Hutton"]}]}}
