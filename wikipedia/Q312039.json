Goalkeeper Paul Robinson was also dropped after recent erratic form. Debut call-ups were handed to two players: Curtis Davies and Gabriel Agbonlahor, both of Aston Villa.

Mowbray replaced them by signing a total of 14 permanent and loan players in the summer transfer window, making an overall profit in the process. His most expensive signings were Chris Brunt from Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a33 million, Leon Barnett from Luton Town for \u00a32.5 million, and James Morrison from Middlesbrough for \u00a31.5 million."]}, {"page": "Steven Caldwell", "response": ["He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 Football League Championship season, playing the whole of a 2\u20131 defeat at Derby County. He came close to opening the scoring in the Europa League play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional, the first time that Birmingham had participated in major European competition for nearly 50 years, when his placed header struck the foot of the post. In the return, Caldwell helped the club beat Nacional 3\u20130 advance to the Group Stage. Since making his debut for Birmingham City, he quickly became a first team regular, forming a centre\u2013back partnership with Curtis Davies. Caldwell then helped the club keep four consecutive clean sheets between 16 October 2011 and 29 October 2011. His performance was praised by Manager Chris Hughton for his dedication and commitment to the team. In return, he praised his philosophy, comparing it to his former manager Owen Coyle and even going far as to say \"the best sort of manager to play for\". Caldwell also captained Birmingham City's matches in the UEFA Europa League group stage, as they were eliminated. He successfully predicted that if the club failed to qualify for the Europa League knockout stage, it would be a disappointment. Once again, Caldwell helped the club keep four consecutive clean sheets between 14 January 2012 and 28 January 2012. In the absent of Stephen Carr and Liam Ridgewell, he captained Birmingham City for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season. Caldwell stated on two occasions that the club can win the promotion back to the Premier League. However in a match against Ipswich Town on 17 April 2012, he suffered a groin injury and was substituted in the 35th minute, as Birmingham City drew 1\u20131. After the match, it was announced that Caldwell was sidelined for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season. He previously missed a match against Watford on 28 August 2011. Caldwell's groin injury was considered to be a loss among the club's supporters, considering his contribution he has done this season so far. However in his absent, Birmingham City lost 3\u20132 against Blackpool in the semi\u2013finals of the Championship play\u2013offs. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, Caldwell went on to make fifty\u2013two appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Abdoulaye Faye", "response": ["On 15 September 2012 against Millwall at the KC Stadium, James Chester and Faye stayed up following a corner and when the ball was worked to Chester on the edge of the Millwall box, he went past Scott Malone down the outside and crossed for Faye to head home past Maik Taylor Two days later, Faye scored his third goal in as many games with a header against Leeds United at Elland Road to make it 2\u20131 to Hull in a 3\u20132 win. He played 33 times for Hull in 2012\u201313 helping the Tigers gain promotion to the Premier League on the final day of the season. He signed a new one-year contract with Hull on 16 May 2013. Faye made limited appearances during the 2013-14 season, making only 3 Premier League appearances after falling behind Curtis Davies, James Chester, Alex Bruce and Paul McShane in the pecking order for the centre-back positions. Faye did make 3 appearances in the FA cup as Hull City reached the FA cup final for the first time in their history, however Faye was an unused substitute for the Wembley semi-final, and did not make the bench for the FA cup final. Thirty-six-year-old Faye was released by Hull City at the end of the 2013\u201314 season."]}, {"page": "Alex Bruce (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["On 20 October 2015 he scored his first goal for Hull City with a 36th-minute header, after coming on for the injured Curtis Davies in the 18th minute of a 3\u20130 win against his former club, Ipswich Town."]}, {"page": "Steve Watson", "response": ["Watson joined Sheffield Wednesday on 9 February 2007 on loan until the end of the 2006\u201307 season, with opportunities at West Brom limited.

However, they won six, drew four and only lost once when Watson was in the team. He was re-called by West Brom on 26 April with two matches remaining as cover for the injured Curtis Davies and the suspended Neil Clement. Watson signed for Wednesday permanently on 10 July 2007 on a free transfer.

The fee was undisclosed. He made his debut for the club in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Braga in the group stage of the Europa League. Away to Club Brugge in the same competition, he was knocked unconscious in a clash of heads with Joseph Akpala for which he received lengthy treatment; in the tenth minute of the resultant stoppage time, Chris Wood scored a winning goal for Birmingham. Pablo had replaced the injured Curtis Davies in the starting eleven, but the concussion sustained at Brugge gave Davies time to regain fitness and his undisputed starting place alongside Steven Caldwell in central defence. After Caldwell's season ended early through injury, Pablo returned to the team for the last few games, including the play-off semi-final defeat, and finished the 62-game season with 17 starts, of which only 7 came in the league."]}]}}
