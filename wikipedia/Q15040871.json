The second of four sons, his father was Joseph Gilbert and his mother, Jane (n\u00e9e Pike). He studied at Marlborough College in Wiltshire and learnt about vine-growing and winemaking on the European mainland.He migrated to South Australia in 1839 on the Buckinghamshire and immediately erected his prefabricated two-roomed Manning cottage on an Adelaide allotment. He acquired a property on the South Para River and stocked it with sheep purchased from Van Diemen's Land. He later moved his flock to a selection near Lyndoch, which he named \"Pewsey Vale\" and developed into an ideal country home.In 1847 he established Pewsey Vale winery in Eden Valley, the same year Jacob's Creek winery was established in the neighbouring Barossa Valley, with substantial cellars, and Pewsey Vale clarets, burgundies and hocks achieved considerable success.He married Anna Browne (1812\u20131873) in 1848. Her brothers Dr. William James Browne (1815 \u2013 4 December 1894) and Dr. John Harris Browne (1817\u20131904) made a wedding present of the property \"Wongalere\" near Williamstown. Joseph's brother William emigrated to South Australia and leased Wongalere for ten years, after which it was managed by Joseph's son, also called William.In 1872 he acquired leases 3-5 in the Northern Territory, just north of Oodnadatta.

Although registered to practise medicine in South Australia, he turned to agricultural pursuits on land he purchased at Pewsey Vale with Joseph Gilbert. His brother John Harris Browne and sister Anna (1812-1873) arrived in 1840 and together they ran a leasehold property at Lyndoch, then Booboorowie, steadily increasing their stockholding. Apart from huge tracts of land they leased or squatted on, they purchased significant properties: Buckland Park in 1856, \"Moorak\" at Mount Gambier in 1862 and Booboorowie in 1863. The partnership was dissolved around 1865. At one stage they were South Australia's largest producers of wool. As a pastoralist he did valuable work in experimenting with grasses and fodder plants, and with fine wools from crossbred Lincoln and Merino sheep. Among station properties which Dr. Browne held were Mikkira, Booboorowie, Spring Vale (or Springvale) Station near Katherine, managed by Alfred Giles and Delamere. A. T. Woods was his agent who managed the forward party in 1879, then in 1880 Giles and his brother Arthur, with H. Pinder, Hart, Needham, Martin, C. Lees, T. Pearce and others, drove 6000 head of cattle, 300 horses and 14,000 sheep from Adelaide, when, despite their undoubted expertise, 6000 of the sheep perished.
