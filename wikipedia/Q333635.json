Heseltine also explored the option of unitary authorities (ie. merging district and county councils), setting up what came to be known as the Banham Commission. Crick regards the Commission as a mistake for which Heseltine has received too little blame. The proposals rumbled on for several years, causing annoyance to many Conservative councillors and to their backers in Parliament. The Commission was reconstituted and scaled down by the then Environment Secretary John Gummer in 1995.Crick 1997, pp. 370\u20134.", "Following Cameron's election to the leadership he set up a wide-ranging policy review.
