A week later winger Chris Johnston left the club on an emergency loan - joining Peterhead. The same day defender Aidan Wilson joined on an emergency loan from Rangers. After defeat to Greenock Morton in the Scottish Cup Aitken re-entered the emergency loan market, to add midfielder Liam Burt on a 28 day loan from Rangers. There was reason to be cheerful a day later, as Dumbarton made it to their first major national cup final for more than 100 years. Danny Handling's first goal for the club was followed by a stunning, late, Dimitris Froxylias free-kick, as Sons overcame Welsh Premier League Champions The New Saints to reach the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup. Four days later, and back on league action, Sons suffered defeat at the hands of Greenock Morton - despite a strong first half showing. Next up was a 0-0 draw with eighth placed Falkirk - a result that left the Sons still searching for their first league goal of 2018.", "| Aidan Wilson", "|DF||style=\"text-align:left\"| Aidan Wilson ||4|| 0 ||3|| 0 ||1||4"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Aidan Wilson"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Aidan Wilson"]}]}}
