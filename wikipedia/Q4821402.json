An influential textbook of entomology that he first wrote went into several editions during his life and was updated posthumously with Imms' General Textbook of Entomology last being published in 1977 as a 10th edition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rothamsted Research", "response": ["*Augustus Daniel Imms"]}, {"page": "Holometabolism", "response": ["In 1883, John Lubbock revitalized Harvey's hypothesis and argued that the origin and evolution of holometabolan development can be explained by the precocious eclosion of the embryo. Hemimetabolan species, whose larvae look like the adult, have an embryo that completes all developmental stages (namely: \"protopod\", \"polipod\", and \"oligopod\" stages) inside the eggshell. Holometabolan species instead have vermiform larvae and a pupal stage after incomplete development and hatching. The debate continued through the twentieth century, with some authors (like Charles P\u00e9rez in 1902) claiming the precocious eclosion theory outlandish, Antonio Berlese reestablishing it as the leading theory in 1913, and Augustus Daniel Imms disseminating it widely among Anglo-Saxon readers from 1925 (see Wigglesworth 1954 for review). One of the most contentious aspects of the precocious eclosion theory that fueled further debate in the field of evolution and development was the proposal that the hemimetabolan nymphal stages are equivalent to the holometabolan pupal stage. Critics of this theory (most notably H. E. Hinton) argue that post-embryonic development in hemimetabolans and holometabolans are equivalent, and rather the last nymphal instar stage of hemimetabolans would be homologous to the holometabolan pupae. More modern opinions still oscillate between these two conceptions of the hemi- to holometabolan evolutionary trend."]}, {"page": "Royal Entomological Society", "response": ["* 1936\u20131937: Augustus Daniel Imms"]}, {"page": "Timeline of entomology since 1900", "response": ["* Augustus Daniel Imms General textbook of Entomology published. 10th revised edition (1977) still one of the most widely used of all insect texts."]}, {"page": "Imms", "response": ["* Augustus Daniel Imms (1880\u20131949), English educator and entomologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Augustus Daniel Imms||02/05/1929||24 August 1880 \u2013 3 April 1949"]}, {"page": "A.D.

Its seventh edition appeared in 1948, the year before his death. By then it had become one of the standard entomological textbooks of its day; in 1958 it was described as having been \"the standard reference work for over 30 years\". In 1942, Imms published a shorter, simpler version, Outlines of Entomology.

He then studied at Lucknow where he obtained a Bachelors (1929) and a Master of Science in 1930. He began work at the Locust Research Institute in 1931 at Lyallpur and went to Cambridge where he worked on the embryology of Schistocerca gregaria under the guidance of Augustus Daniel Imms and obtained a Ph.D. in 1935. He was a demonstrator at Cambridge University for a term in 1934 and taught at the Government College Ajmer for a few months in 1935. He joined the Zoological Survey of India where he worked at the birds and mammals section from 1939 to 1940. Roonwal joined the army during the Second World War and served as a Major in the 15th Punjab Regiment and received a Burma Star for his services. From 1946 he continued his studies on the desert locust and published ideas on predicting the formation of swarms. He joined the Forest Research Institute in 1949 as an entomologist and worked on cataloguing the insect collections held there. He continued working there until 1956 during which time he took an interest in the systematics of termites in which he collaborated with Alfred E. Emerson. In 1956 he joined the Zoological Survey of India to succeed Sunder Lal Hora as the director. He retired from the ZSI in 1965 and joined Jodhpur University. He received a Sc.D. for his work on the morphology and systematics of termites in 1962 from Cambridge University."]}]}}
