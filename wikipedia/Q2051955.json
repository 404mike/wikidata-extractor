The band's name comes from the character Travis Henderson (played by Harry Dean Stanton) from the film Paris, Texas (1984).", "The band that would become Travis was formed by brothers Chris Martyn (bass) and Geoff Martyn (keyboards) along with Simon Jarvis (drums). Andy Dunlop, a school friend at Lenzie Academy, was drafted in on guitar. The line-up was completed by a female vocalist, Catherine Maxwell, and the band's name became \"Glass Onion\", after the Beatles song of the same name. Neil Primrose joined to replace Jarvis.  Parting company with their singer in the spring of 1991, they auditioned for a new vocalist. Having met each other through Primrose pouring him a pint, an untrained art student, Fran Healy, then joined after being invited to audition by Primrose. Healy joined the band on the day he enrolled at The Glasgow School of Art, in the autumn of 1991. Two years later, with the option of music holding more appeal, Healy dropped out of art school, and inspired by songwriters such as Joni Mitchell, assumed songwriting responsibilities. With brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn on bass and keyboards, in 1993, the fivesome released a privately made CD, The Glass Onion EP, featuring the tracks \"Dream On\", \"The Day Before\", \"Free Soul\" and \"Whenever She Comes Round\". 500 copies of the EP were made and were recently valued at \u00a31000 each.

Yet although the likes of 'Turn' and 'Driftwood' were undeniably easy on the ear paradigms for thoughtful indie/adult rock, they seemed to lack any kind of edge to go further particularly on the unremarkable 'Why Does It Always Rain On Me?' which was in danger of becoming their musical albatross. It seems as they have never been away but the follow-up release signifies their intention to become known as an albums band. The singles thus far, 'Sing' and 'Side', both feature hypnotic tunes courtesy mainly of Andy Dunlop's fine guitar work; the former is hopeful and joyous whilst the latter is steeped in melancholy. Further exposure to the album unveils a remarkably consistent level of songwriting with the unassuming-looking Dunlop always able to turn guitar and even banjo into memorable verses and choruses whilst Fran Healy sensibly never over-reaches in his successful quest for the yearning vocal. It's easy to imagine that the earnest, yet brilliant, likes of 'The Last Train' and 'Pipe Dreams' might alienate former fans but Travis are clearly above turning into victims of their own success. As an exercise in how modern rock should sound like, 'The Invisible Band' will take some beating\".", "* Andy Dunlop \u2013 guitar, banjo"]}, {"page": "Singles (Travis album)", "response": ["*Andy Dunlop \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, banjo"]}, {"page": "The Man Who", "response": ["*Andy Dunlop \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Good Feeling (Travis album)", "response": ["*Andy Dunlop \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Magne Furuholmen", "response": ["Furuholmen released his first solo album \"Past Perfect Future Tense\" in 2004, with appearances from Guy Berryman and Will Champion of Coldplay, and from Andy Dunlop of the Scottish band Travis."]}, {"page": "Boulevard of Broken Songs", "response": ["** Andy Dunlop \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*Andy Dunlop (Travis)"]}, {"page": "Lenzie", "response": ["*Andy Dunlop (b.1972), musician and lead guitarist of indie band Travis"]}, {"page": "Neil Primrose (musician)", "response": ["This led to his joining the band Glass Onion with Andy Dunlop along with brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn in the early 1990s.

He came up with the song as he watched a swingbeat video on MTV, leading him to compose a basic melody called \"Swing\" on his guitar. Healy liked the results and said that he appreciated the free chorus and verse melody. \"It really felt like it took to the air\", he said on the band's official website. The following day, after recording the B-side \"We Are Monkeys\", Healy began to play the song's chords while the track was rewinding, and the rest of his bandmates soon joined him. Healy then asked for the production of \"We Are Monkeys\" to be put on hold so they could record a demo of the new composition. As he performed with the rest of Travis, he changed the word \"swing\" to \"sing\" on the chorus.
