He admitted that he had expected to stay at the New Meadow, but that he was happy to switch clubs in an attempt to win promotion out of League Two for a second successive season with the \"Valiants\". He began the 2012\u201313 season in excellent form, and was named as man of the match after saving eleven shots in a 1\u20130 win over Bradford City at Valley Parade on 29 September. However three days later he dropped a \"clanger\" at Vale Park as a weak 25-yard shot from Dagenham & Redbridge midfielder Luke Howell \"somehow squirmed beneath the embarrassed keeper and trickled into the Vale net\" in a disappointing 1\u20131 draw. He began wearing protective face gear after bruising his cheekbone against Dagenham, and then continued to wear the gear as he superstitiously believed they were essential to the team's run of good results (however he stopped this practice after a run of defeats in December). He made \"a string of flying stops during a man-of-the-match display\" in an FA Cup defeat to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on 1 December. He remained a near ever-present, playing 51 games as Vale were promoted at the end of the season in third-place, and was voted as both the Port Vale's players' player of the season and away fan's player of the season."]}, {"page": "Howell (name)", "response": ["*Luke Howell (born 1994), Australian film actor"]}, {"page": "Scott Doe", "response": ["In May 2016, he re-signed for Dagenham & Redbridge after their relegation to the National League along with Luke Howell on a free transfer, re-uniting with former manager John Still.

After the game, Saunders said he expected to score and said: \"I feel in previous games I've come close to scoring with a few strikes and it was a relief to be honest to get on the scoresheet, Hopefully now I've got one I'll start to get a few more. When you score and don't get anything out of the game it kind of gets forgotten but if it's a goal that gets you a point or a goal which wins a game or helps win a game, you get more recognition for it.\" That did happen when followed up by his second on 5 January 2013, in a match against Accrington Stanley and set up a goal for Luke Howell in a 2\u20130 win.
