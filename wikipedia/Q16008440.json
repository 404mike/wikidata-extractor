He was born at Knaresborough, Yorkshire and died at Leeds, also in Yorkshire.\nPrentice was a right-handed batsman often used as an opener and a right-arm off-break bowler, used irregularly and often rather expensively. He played a few matches for Yorkshire's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1931. But with competition for places in Yorkshire's first eleven very stiff, he left to join Leicestershire, where he was not qualified for County Championship games until 1935. From then on until the end of the 1949 season he was a regular in the Leicestershire first team.", "link_mentions": {}}}
