He was born at Knaresborough, Yorkshire and died at Leeds, also in Yorkshire.\nPrentice was a right-handed batsman often used as an opener and a right-arm off-break bowler, used irregularly and often rather expensively. He played a few matches for Yorkshire's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1931. But with competition for places in Yorkshire's first eleven very stiff, he left to join Leicestershire, where he was not qualified for County Championship games until 1935. From then on until the end of the 1949 season he was a regular in the Leicestershire first team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Leicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.Playfair, pp. 106\u2013107."]}, {"page": "Frank Prentice", "response": ["#REDIRECTFrancis Prentice"]}, {"page": "Laurence Thursting", "response": ["He was recruited by Leicestershire in 1938 from the ground-staff at Lord's primarily as a bowler, but had little success at that. Instead he developed very quickly as a right-handed opening batsman, with opportunities opening up because of injuries to Francis Prentice and then Stewie Dempster's regular unavailability. His high point and his highest score came in the match against Warwickshire when his 94, made in four and a quarter hours, helped Leicestershire to save the game after they had to follow on. In the season, he scored 625 runs at an average of 27.17."]}]}}
