Lewis passed this material to a second legal firm, Hickman Rose, who in turn asked the former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald to examine the evidence and report his findings to the News International board.

No journalists were charged.   Whittamore, Boyall, King, and Marshall pleaded guilty in April 2005. According to ICO head Richard Thomas, \"each pleaded guilty yet, despite the extent and the frequency of their admitted criminality, each was conditionally discharged [for two years], raising important questions for public policy.\"   The following year John Gunning was convicted of acquiring private subscriber information from British Telecom's database.", "Met officials consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)  headed by Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ken Macdonald about the best general way to proceed with the investigation and prosecution.  The Met did not disclose all available evidence to senior CPS prosecutors at this time, reportedly omitting documents indicating that reporters in addition to Clive Goodman appeared to have been using Mulcaire's services.  The CPS appears to have provided some rationale to the Met for limiting the  investigation by initially advising that \"phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.\"  In fact, the hacking was illegal under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act regardless of whether messages had already been listened to by their intended recipient even if it was not illegal under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The precise nature of the guidance given by CPS to the Met became the subject of public disagreement between them in 2011, at which time it was noted, among other things, that the charges brought against Goodman and Mulcaire included counts where there was no evidence provided regarding whether messages had already been heard or not.", "In May 2011, News International's law firm, Hickman & Rose, hired former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald to review the emails newspaper executives had used as the basis of their claim that no one at News of the World but Clive Goodman had been involved in phone hacking.

(See discussion of Operation Elveden, below.)", "From 2003 to 2008, Ken Macdonald was Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).  During this period, Andy Hayman of the Metropolitan Police Service limited the Met's investigation of alleged phone hacking to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire.  John Yates later claimed the investigation was limited as a result of collaboration with the CPS because CPS indicated no law was broken unless the voice messages were listened to by phone hackers before the intended recipient listed to them.  Macdonald recused himself from these strategy sessions because of his acquaintance with the then editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson.", "News International faced growing scepticism and criticism from newspapers, Parliament, and the police about the single \"rogue reporter\" stance.  There were also questions about illegal action by the police themselves.  As a result, News International's parent company, News Corporation arranged for another review of the emails.  In May 2011, their law firm, Hickman & Rose, hired Ken Macdonald, still an acquaintance of former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, to review the emails H&L had held since 2007.  When Macdonald reviewed the e-mails, it took him less than five minutes' to conclude that it was \"blindingly obvious\" that they represented evidence of criminal wrongdoing.  He advised the News Corporation board to give the emails to the police,  \"a move that set off the current investigation into the payments made to the police by journalists at The News of the World.  The company then trawled through other documents, including its cash authorization records, and found 130,000 pounds\u2019 worth of payments to a group of officers over several years, according to officials with knowledge of the inquiry. Included within those records was documentation of a thousand-pound cash withdrawal around the date of Mr. Goodman's e-mail concerning his purchase of the Green Book from a police officer.\"", "As part of setting their investigative priorities in 2006, the Met consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to agree upon a strategy for pursuing the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry.  Assistant commissioner John Yates claimed that the Met was guided by advice from the CPS, then headed by Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ken Macdonald,  that \"phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.\"  Yates told Parliament on four separate occasions that it was on the basis of this legal theory that Yates repeatedly claimed that only 10 to 12 phone hacking victims had been identified.
