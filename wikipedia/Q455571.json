Her mother compiled the child's poetry into collections of \"Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett\". Her father called her the \"Poet Laureate of Hope End\" and encouraged her work. The result is one of the largest collections of juvenilia of any English writer. Mary Russell Mitford described the young Elizabeth at this time, as having \"a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.\"", "In London, John Kenyon, a distant cousin, introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including William Wordsworth, Mary Russell Mitford, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Carlyle. Elizabeth continued to write, contributing \"The Romaunt of Margaret\", \"The Romaunt of the Page\", \"The Poet's Vow\" and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers, including Mary Russell Mitford, who would become a close friend and who would support Elizabeth's literary ambitions.", "Throughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning's poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women's movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women's rights principles, suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In Aurora Leigh, however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she \"is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...\" A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century."]}, {"page": "January 10", "response": ["*1855 \u2013 Mary Russell Mitford, English author and playwright (b. 1787)"]}, {"page": "1787", "response": ["* December 16 \u2013 Mary Russell Mitford, English novelist, dramatist (d. 1855)"]}, {"page": "1855", "response": ["* January 10 \u2013 Mary Russell Mitford, English novelist, dramatist (b. 1787)"]}, {"page": "Mary, Queen of Scots (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Mary, Queen of Scots, an 1831 book by Mary Russell Mitford"]}, {"page": "Reading, Berkshire", "response": ["Mary Russell Mitford lived in Reading for a number of years and then spent the rest of her life just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield.

Constanza died in 1345, weeks after giving birth to Fernando, who eventually became the first of Peter's sons to succeed him as king of Portugal. The scandal of Peter's affair with In\u00eas, and its political ramifications, caused Afonso to banish In\u00eas from court after Constanza died. Peter refused to marry any of the princesses his father suggested as a second wife; and the king refused to allow his son to marry In\u00eas as Peter wanted. The two aristocratic lovers began living together in secret. According to the chronicle of Fern\u00e3o Lopes, during this period, Peter began giving In\u00eas's brothers, exiles from the Castilian court, important positions in Portugal and they became the heir-apparent's closest advisors. This alarmed Afonso. He worried that upon his death, civil war could tear the country apart, or the Portuguese throne would fall into Castilian hands, either as Juan Manuel fought to avenge his daughter's honor, or the de Castro brothers supported their sister. Peter claimed that he had married In\u00eas against his father's orders. In any event, in 1355, Afonso sent three men to find In\u00eas at the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha in Coimbra, where she was detained, and they decapitated her in front of one of her young children. Enraged, Peter revolted against his father. Afonso defeated his son within a year, but died shortly thereafter, and Peter succeeded to the throne in 1357. The love affair and father-son conflict inspired more than twenty operas and many writers, including: the Portuguese national epic Os Lus\u00edadas by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, the Spanish \"Nise lastimosa\" and \"Nise laureada\" (1577) by Jer\u00f3nimo Berm\u00fadez and 'Reinar despues de morir' by Lu\u00eds V\u00e9lez de Guevara, as well as \"Inez de Castro\" by Mary Russell Mitford and Henry de Montherlant's French drama La Reine morte."]}, {"page": "St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9, comtesse de Genlis", "response": ["F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Genlis appears as a character in the works of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (Illusions perdues) and Victor Hugo (Les Mis\u00e9rables), among others.

Unlike many men's publications, however, the Lady's Magazine largely stayed out of the political sphere and did not report on political events; for instance, in the lead-up to the French Revolutionary Wars, Lady's Magazine readers are reassured that France is no match for British naval power, while readers of The Gentleman's Magazine are warned that Europe is \"at the present moment [in a state of] alarm and danger\". Mary Poovey, a professor of English, posits that The Lady's Magazines projection of national strength was intended to avoid alarming its female readers and thus causing anxiety in the domestic sphere; conversely, men's magazines sought to arouse anger over an emerging enemy and thus encourage male readers to be ready to undertake an active military role."]}, {"page": "Letitia Elizabeth Landon", "response": ["At the age of five, Landon began attending Frances Arabella Rowden's school at 22 Hans Place, Knightsbridge.

Anne Isabella Milbanke gave a glowing review of the novel, while Mary Russell Mitford criticizes Elizabeth's lack of taste.In a letter to Sir William Elford dated 20 December 1814. The modern exegetes are torn between admiration for the vitality of the character and the disappointment of seeing Elizabeth intentionally suppress her verve and submit, at least outwardly, to male authority.Lydia Martin 2007 , p. 201. In Susan Fraiman's essay \"The Humiliation of Elizabeth Bennett\", the author criticises the fact that Elizabeth must forgo her development as a woman in order to ensure the success of \"ties among men [such as her father and Darcy] with agendas of their own\". The Bennet sisters have only a relatively small dowry of \u00a31,000; and as their family's estate will pass out of their hands when their father dies, the family faces a major social decline, giving the Bennet girls only a limited time in which to find a husband.MacDonagh, Oliver \"Minor Female Characters Depict Women's Roles\", pp. 85-93 (88), in Readings on Pride and Prejudice, ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999. About feminist criticism of the character, the French critic Roger Martin du Gard wrote that primary purpose of Austen was to provide jouissance (enjoyment) to her readers, not preach, but the character of Elizabeth is able to manoeuvre within the male-dominated power structure of Regency England to assert her interests in a system that favours her father, Mr Darcy, and the other male characters.Gard, Roger \"Questioning the Merit of Pride and Prejudice\", pp. 111\u2013117, in Readings on Pride and Prejudice ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999. Gard noted that the novel hardly glorifies patriarchy since it is strongly implied that was the financial irresponsibility of Mr Bennet that has placed his family in a precarious social position.  Furthermore, it is Elizabeth who criticises her father for not doing more to teach her sisters Lydia and Catherine the value of a good character, which Mr Bennet disregards, leading to Lydia's eloping with Wickham.MacDonagh, Oliver \"Minor Female Characters Depict Women's Roles\", pp. 85\u201393 (89), in Readings on Pride and Prejudice, ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999. Unlike the more superficial and/or selfish characters like Lydia, Wickham, Mr Collins, and Charlotte, who regard marriage as a simple matter of satisfying their own desires, for the more mature Elizabeth marriage is the cause of much reflection and serious thought on her part.Brown, Julia Prewit \"The Narrator's Voice\" from Readings on Pride and Prejudice, ed.
