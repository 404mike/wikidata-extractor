The final plan, known as Operation Infatuate, involved two amphibious assaults to be launched simultaneously, one to be launched from Breskens to Flushing by 4 Commando (the one Army unit in the 4th Commando Brigade), and the other assault to be directed by the main force of 4th Commando Brigade at the beach at Westkapelle, the westernmost point of Walcheren. Westkapelle was still heavily defended and the defences had not been greatly affected by the flooding of the island. Fourteen batteries with guns ranging from 75mm up to 200mm were sited, pointing seawards, within the defences.
