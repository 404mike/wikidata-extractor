Starring Bernice Stegers, Philip Sayer, and Simon Nash, the film focuses on a father who was abducted by aliens and returns to his family three years later, where he goes in search of his son. Production of the film started and completed in February 1982. The film received largely negative reviews, though the special effects were praised.", "* Bernice Stegers as Rachel Phillips", "From contemporary reviews, Alan Jones wrote in Starburst that the film has \"occasional flashes of tangential inspiration\" but was \"really nothing very xtro-ordinary.\" finding that scenes did not scare him \"or even disgusted [him] to any great extent\" and that he would have liked more characterisation and that Bernice Stegers was \"horribly miscast\". Jones went on to state that the special effects were \"minor miracles of ingenuity\" for their low budget and he at least admired director Metcalfe for \"trying so earnestly to resuscitate low budget exploitation sf/horror films in this country.\" Jo Imeson of the Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as a \"sub s-f rip-off\" and that it was \"entirely lacking in the energy or resonances of It's Alive! horror-within-the-family genre.\" The review also noted \"flat acting\" stating that Bernice Stegers was \"weighed down by a depressingly one-dimensional role\".  The review did note that \"one or two effects are quite memorable-the cocoon in the bathroom, the revolving birth of a full-sized man\".\"Lor.\" of Variety found the film \"too silly and underdeveloped in story values to expand beyond diehard fans\" and that \"Harry B Davenport builds little suspense and no thrills in a film devoid of stuntwork or action scenes. It's just another \"check out that makeup\" exercise, consisting of brief scenes and poor continuity\" and that \"acting is flat, with Stegers [...] inexpressive and unattractively styled.\" Roger Ebert panned the film, awarding it 1 of 4 stars, calling the film \"ugly\" and \"despairing\" and further commenting, \"Most exploitation movies are bad, but not necessarily painful to watch. They may be incompetent, they may be predictable, they may be badly acted or awkwardly directed, but at some level the filmmakers are enjoying themselves and at least trying to entertain an audience. 'Xtro' is an exception, a completely depressing, nihilistic film, an exercise in sadness ... It's movies like this that give movies a bad name\". Stephen Hunter writing for The Baltimore Sun called the film \"the slimiest, wormiest, most nauseating film to come oozing into Baltimore in some time.\" that was \"almost wholly incomprehensible\" Hunter went on to state that \"what is most depressing about Xtro is that its performances are first-rate, especially Steger's as the distraught Mum\" and that the cinematographer by John Metcalfe \"displays a good deal of technical finesse, particularly the long, apartment sequence\""]}, {"page": "City of Women", "response": ["* Bernice Stegers as Woman on train"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Frederick Treves, Bernice Stegers, Peter-Hugo Daly, Lloyd McGuire"]}, {"page": "Tipping the Velvet (TV series)", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\" | Mrs Denby || colspan=\"2\"| Bernice Stegers || bgcolor=lightgrey|"]}, {"page": "Light Years Away", "response": ["* Bernice Stegers as Betty"]}, {"page": "Carolyn De Fonseca", "response": ["| 1980 || Macabre || Jane Baker  || Bernice Stegers"]}, {"page": "List of science fiction films of the 1980s", "response": ["|Bernice Stegers, Philip Sayer, Simon Nash, Maryam d'Abo, Danny Brainin", "|Xtro||Harry Bromley Davenport||Philip Sayer, Bernice Stegers, Danny Brainin||United Kingdom||"]}, {"page": "List of Swedish films of the 1980s", "response": ["|Kuoleman kumppani|| The Girl||Arne Mattsson||Franco Nero, Bernice Stegers, Christopher Lee || Drama||"]}, {"page": "To Catch a Spy", "response": ["* Bernice Stegers as Russian Girl"]}, {"page": "The Girl (1987 film)", "response": ["The Girl is a 1987 British-Swedish drama film directed by Arne Mattsson and starring Franco Nero, Bernice Stegers and Christopher Lee.", "* Bernice Stegers ...
