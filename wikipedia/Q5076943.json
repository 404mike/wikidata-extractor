Irving was receiving calls from international news companies\u2014Newsweek, The Observer, Bild Zeitung, the BBC\u2014and he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also stated that he could not believe the diaries were genuine. The following day The Times published the news that their sister paper The Sunday Times had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage, Trever-Roper had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of The Times, Charles Douglas-Home. The Times editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at The Sunday Times, while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday Times thus remained oblivious to the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*Charles Douglas-Home (1937\u20131985), Editor, The Times, 1982\u20131985"]}, {"page": "Bernard Levin", "response": ["In 1981 Levin took a sabbatical from The Times after Rupert Murdoch bought the paper and Harold Evans succeeded Rees-Mogg as editor.
