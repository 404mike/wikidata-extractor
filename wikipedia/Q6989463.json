Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde."]}, {"page": "Stranraer F.C.", "response": ["The club, now under the management of Billy McLaren, then spent a further four years in the Second Division, with the most notable event being a strong Scottish Cup run in season 2002\u201303, which saw them go to the quarter finals, where they were beaten 4\u20130 by SPL side Motherwell. However, the team's cup run did not reflect their league form, as they finished ninth in the Second Division, and thus were relegated to the Third Division for season 2003\u201304. The team's fortunes improved from there as, under Neil Watt, they won the Third Division at the first attempt, gaining promotion back to the Second Division. In season 2004\u201305, the team stayed in the top two for most of the campaign. A 1\u20131 draw with closest promotion rivals Morton on 30 April 2005 saw them gain promotion to the First Division for the third time, although they were relegated to the Second Division the following season after finishing ninth and losing out in the play-offs to Partick Thistle."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in Scottish football", "response": ["| Ayr United ||  Bobby Connor || Sacked || 26 February 2007 ||  Neil Watt || 22 March 2007"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 in Scottish football", "response": ["| Ayr United ||  Neil Watt || Resigned || 23 October ||  Brian Reid || 24 October"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Scottish Third Division", "response": ["|  Neil Watt"]}, {"page": "Allan Jenkins (footballer)", "response": ["Jenkins began his senior career with local club Stranraer in 1998 and made over 200 appearances for the club.

On 12 January 2006 Jenkins was signed by Gretna for an undisclosed fee. Stranraer's form collapsed as they collected only one further league win all season.
