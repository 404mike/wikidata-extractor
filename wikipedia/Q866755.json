She was the major part of a translation partnership with her husband, Edwin Muir. She and her husband translated the works of many notable German-speaking authors including Franz Kafka.

The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by Schocken Books in 1948 as The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces, including additionally The First Long Train Journey, written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's \"A Novel about Youth\", a review of Felix Sternheim's Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald, his essay on Kleist's \"Anecdotes\", his review of the literary magazine Hyperion, and an epilogue by Brod."]}, {"page": "The Metamorphosis", "response": ["* 1961: Edwin Muir and Willa Muir"]}, {"page": "In the Penal Colony", "response": ["If all parallels with the Bible are considered, the reading can be \u201can unorthodox \u2026 vision of traditional theology\u201d. p. 113. The old way of running the colony is reminiscent of the views presented in the Old Testament, with the old Commandant \u2013 creator of the torture machine, as well as the colony itself \u2013 resembling God. The old Commandant focused on human guilt, which \u201cis never to be doubted\u201d.Fowler 1879, p. 115. The comparison between the machine used in the penal colony and the world in general could mean that the purpose of life is to deserve salvation from the guilt by means of suffering.Fowler 1979, p. 113. According to Geddes, however, interpreting the usage of the contraption in such a way could result in glossing over the story\u2019s lesson \u2013 dangers of viewing events as a form of a theodicy, secular or sacred. More parallels include the new, more liberal rules established in the colony after the death of the original Commandant, which might represent the New Testament.Fowler 1979, p. 116. Similarly to the way in which Christianity evolved from \u201cold law of the Hebraic tradition\u201d to the merciful rules of the New Testament, we can see such progression in Kafka\u2019s story.Fowler 1979, p. 116. The officer could represent Christ, but in \u201cKafka\u2019s inversion of traditional Christian theology\", he sacrifices himself to showcase his support for the former Commandant, as opposed to the new rules.Fowler 1979, p. 116. The inscription on the grave of the old Commandant may also imply that the \u201csecond coming\u201d refers to the comeback of old rules.Fowler 1979, p. 117.

Neumeyer added that the English translation of the short story created by Willa Muir and Edwin Muir contain inaccuracies, including those that support the religious interpretation, giving the reader a \u201cmisshapen image\u201d of the story.Neumeyer 1979, p. 111."]}, {"page": "Montrose, Angus", "response": ["*Willa Muir (1890 \u2013 1970), Montrose-born feminist novelist, academic and pioneering translator into English of major works by Franz Kafka."]}, {"page": "Edwin Muir", "response": ["His wife, Willa Muir, translated the works of many German authors, including Franz Kafka.
