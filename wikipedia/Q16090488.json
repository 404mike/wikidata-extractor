He was released after 4\u00bd months.As a consequence, he was stripped of his CBE to which he had been appointed in the 1999 Birthday Honours, and of his Deputy Lieutenancy. Further allegations of indecent assault against a girl were dropped in 2008 due to lack of evidence.He died after suffering a stroke in March 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of revocations of appointments to orders and awarded decorations and medals of the United Kingdom", "response": ["*2001: Freddie Emery-Wallis (appointed 1999), following his conviction for sexual abuse."]}, {"page": "Emery (name)", "response": ["* Freddie Emery-Wallis (1927\u20132017), British politician "]}, {"page": "Frederick Alfred John Emery-Wallis", "response": ["#REDIRECTFreddie Emery-Wallis"]}, {"page": "Frederick Emery-Wallis", "response": ["#REDIRECTFreddie Emery-Wallis"]}, {"page": "Frederick Alfred John Emery-Wallis FSA", "response": ["#REDIRECT Freddie Emery-Wallis "]}, {"page": "Freddie Emery-Wallis FSA", "response": ["#REDIRECT Freddie Emery-Wallis "]}]}}
