Thus, Charles S. Maier suggests that a political economy approach \"interrogates economic doctrines to disclose their sociological and political premises.... in sum, [it] regards economic ideas and behavior not as frameworks for analysis, but as beliefs and actions that must themselves be explained\".Mayer, Charles S.

This approach informs Andrew Gamble's The Free Economy and the Strong State (Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and Colin Hay's The Political Economy of New Labour (Manchester University Press, 1999). It also informs much work published in New Political Economy, an international journal founded by Sheffield University scholars in 1996.cf: Baker, David (2006). \"The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?\" , New Political Economy, 11(2), pp. 227\u2013250."]}, {"page": "Thatcherism", "response": ["Some commentators have argued that Thatcherism should not be considered properly libertarian. Noting the tendency towards strong central government in matters concerning the trade unions and local authorities, Andrew Gamble summarised Thatcherism as \"the free economy and the strong state\". Simon Jenkins accused the Thatcher government of carrying out a nationalisation of Britain. Libertarian political theorist Murray Rothbard did not consider Thatcherism to be libertarian and heavily criticised Thatcher and Thatcherism stating that \"Thatcherism is all too similar to Reaganism: free-market rhetoric masking statist content\". Stuart McAnulla states that Thatcherism is actually liberal conservatism, a combination of liberal economics and a strong state."]}, {"page": "Tony Wright (Cannock Chase MP)", "response": ["*The New Social Democracy edited by Tony Wright and Andrew Gamble (Blackwell, 1999) "]}, {"page": "The Freedom Association", "response": ["The Freedom Association was founded in 1975 as the National Association for Freedom (NAFF) by the Viscount De L'Isle, Norris McWhirter, Ross McWhirter and John Gouriet.

On this view, we cannot validly say that products took a certain amount of labour, energy and materials to make, and compare them on that basis. It follows that the Austrian School thinks most contemporary economic theory is invalid, as it relies in one way or another on the aggregation and comparison of actual and ideal prices. This is forcefully argued by Friedrich von Hayek who therefore was skeptical about the objectivity of macroeconomic aggregations as such.Friedrich von Hayek, Individualism and economic order. London: Routledge, 1948. Andrew Gamble, Hayek: the iron cage of liberty. Westview Press, 1996, p. 67-68. However, this raises the question of \"what is the explanatory power of Austrian economics\", if all we can say about a realized price is that it expresses a subjective preference, given that there are billions of subjective preferences which are all different.See further e.g. Bruce Caldwell, Hayek's Challenge: an intellectual biography of F.A.
