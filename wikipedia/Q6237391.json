Halsted.John Halsted (1768 \u2013 2 November 1830) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nBorn into a naval family, Halsted went to sea at an early age with his father and at least one of his brothers. After a period of schooling he rejoined the navy and served aboard a number of ships and under a variety of notable commanders of the age, until reaching the rank of lieutenant shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He went out to the East Indies for much of them, serving onshore with troops and later commanding a sloop, before returning to Britain hoping to receive post-rank and the command of a frigate. He was disappointed, the Admiralty declined to confirm his appointment and he spent a number of years without a ship.\nHe returned to active service only in 1804, with the command of a defence and storeship, followed by a position as agent for transports for the expedition to Copenhagen in 1807. He again escaped official notice, and it was not until 1808 that he received a promotion to post-captain. He took command of the 74-gun HMS Bellerophon in 1810, followed by the 74-gun HMS Scarborough in 1813, commanding them in the North Sea. His final service during the wars was to oversee the impress service at Gosport, a post that allowed him to meet Prince Regent. He seems to have had no further service after the wars ended in 1815, and eventually died, still a post-captain, in 1830.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HMS Bellerophon (1786)", "response": ["Bellerophon was briefly refitted in January 1810, after which she was anchored at the Nore. She then resumed her blockade duties in the North Sea, serving under a succession of commanders. Warren was succeeded by Captain John Halsted on 23 August, and he by Captain Augustus Brine on 5 November. Brine's command lasted until February 1813, during which time Bellerophon remained with the North Sea blockading squadron. Captain Edward Hawker took over command on 11 February 1813. Shortly thereafter, Bellerophon transported Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, the newly appointed Governor of Newfoundland, to St. John's, Newfoundland."]}, {"page": "Halsted", "response": ["* John Halsted (1761-1830), Royal Navy officer"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Halsted", "response": ["Halsted was born in Gosport on 2 April 1764, the son of naval officer Captain William Anthony Halsted, and his wife Mary, n\u00e9e Frankland. Three of Lawrence's brothers had naval careers; Charles Halsted became a lieutenant and was lost with  in 1780, John Halsted became a captain, and George Halsted rose to be a commander. The elder Halsted was appointed commander of the former 60-gun  in March 1776. Jersey had been fitted out as a hospital ship and assigned to Lord Howe's fleet for service off North America, and Halsted took his son with him as a midshipman. Lawrence served with his father for the next two years, and participated in a number of naval operations along the American coast before his transfer into Captain Richard Onslow's 64-gun  on 25 May 1778. Halsted's father died shortly after this, but Onslow took on the role of patron, and the two sailed to the West Indies with Commodore William Hotham's squadron to join Admiral Samuel Barrington."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*John Halsted, naval commander, was born in Gosport"]}, {"page": "Halsted, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Halsted"]}]}}
