He is known for his louche lifestyle as much as for his literary output.\nExpelled from Charterhouse School, he was commissioned in the infantry in National service, before studying at King's College, Cambridge. Unable to earn a living as a writer, he rejoined the Army, but soon resigned, rather than be court-martialled for 'conduct unbecoming' on account of his gambling debts.\nDeclaring that he wrote only for people who shared his own standards, he never attracted the mass market, and had to be rescued by publisher Anthony Blond, who paid him a regular wage on condition that he stayed out of London and concentrated on his writings, many of which Blond published. The arrangement lasted for over 30 years.\nRaven is remembered for his ten-novel sequence Alms for Oblivion and its baroque, supernatural sequels The Roses of Picardie and September Castle; as well as The Feathers of Death, an exploratory early army novel dealing with homosexuality between officers and \"other ranks\". He also wrote scripts for the television drama series The Pallisers (1974) and Edward & Mrs. Simpson (1978)).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dr. No (novel)", "response": ["Prior to the release of Dr. No\u2014and unconnected with the book itself\u2014Bernard Bergonzi, in the March 1958 issue of Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work, saying it contained \"a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism\" and that the books showed \"the total lack of any ethical frame of reference\". The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures. The writer Simon Raven, while appreciating Bergonzi had produced a \"quiet and well-argued article\", thought the critic's conclusion was na\u00efve, and asked \"Since when has it been remarkable in a work of entertainment that it should lack a specific 'ethical frame of reference'?\" Raven continued, saying Fleming \"by reason of his cool and analytical intelligence, his informed use of technical facts, his plausibility, sense of pace, brilliant descriptive powers and superb imagination, provides sheer entertainment such as I, who must read many novels, am seldom lucky enough to find\"."]}, {"page": "Love in a Cold Climate", "response": ["* in 1980 by Simon Raven for Thames Television (set 1924-1940) starring Lucy Gutteridge, Rosalyn Landor, Michael Aldridge, Judi Dench, Vivian Pickles and Jean-Pierre Cassel "]}, {"page": "The Eustace Diamonds", "response": ["*The Eustace Diamonds; with an introduction by Simon Raven.

G. Farrell", "response": ["Farrell published his first novel, A Man From Elsewhere, in 1963. Set in France, it shows the clear influence of French Existentialism. The story follows Sayer, a journalist for a communist paper, as he tries to find skeletons in Regan's closet. Regan is a dying novelist who is about to be awarded an important Catholic literary prize. The book mimics the fight between the two leaders of French existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, Sayer representing Sartre and Regan Camus. The two argue about existentialism: the position that murder can be vindicated as an expedient in overthrowing tyranny (Sartre) versus the stance that there are no ends that justify unjust means (Camus). Bernard Bergonzi reviewed it in the New Statesman's 20 September 1963 issue, writing, \"Many first novels are excessively autobiographical, but A Man from Elsewhere suffers from the opposite fault of being a cerebral construct, dreamed up out of literature and the contemporary French cinema.\" Simon Raven wrote in The Observer on 15 September 1963, \"Mr. Farrell's style is spare, his plotting lucid and well timed; his expositions of moral or political problems are pungent if occasionally didactic.\" It entirely lacks the ironic humour and tender appreciation of human frailty that characterise his later work.
