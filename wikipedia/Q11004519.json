His Wisden obituary described him as \"among the best known personalities in the world of cricket\". He died of a heart attack just after he had given an address to a cricket society.\nAltham was educated at Repton School and Trinity College, Oxford, and served in the British Army during World War I as a Major with the 60th Rifles. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Military Cross (MC), and was mentioned in despatches on three occasions. He was a schoolmaster and a cricket coach at Winchester College, a position that he held for thirty years, and was also the housemaster of Chernocke House.\nAltham's son, Richard, played in two first-class matches for Oxford University in 1947.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 30", "response": ["*1888 \u2013 Harry Altham, English cricketer and coach (d. 1965)"]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["Rowers from Oxford who have won gold at the Olympics or World Championships include Michael Blomquist, Ed Coode, Chris Davidge, Hugh Edwards, Jason Flickinger, Tim Foster, Luka Grubor, Christopher Liwski, Matthew Pinsent, Pete Reed, Jonny Searle, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Jake Wetzel, Michael Wherley, and Barney Williams.

Grace was still 15 when the 1864 season began and had turned 20 when the 1868 season ended and he began his medical career by enrolling at Bristol Medical School on 7 October 1868.Darwin, p.39. In the interim, specifically in 1866, he became widely recognised as the finest cricketer in England. Just after his eighteenth birthday in July 1866, Grace confirmed his potential with an innings of 224 not out for All-England against Surrey at The Oval. It was his maiden first-class century and, according to Harry Altham, he was \"thenceforward the biggest name in cricket and the main spectator attraction with the successes (coming) thick and fast\".Altham, p.125.", "According to Harry Altham, 1871 was Grace's annus mirabilis, except that he produced another outstanding year in 1895.Altham, p.126. In all first-class matches in 1871, a total of 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge.Rae, p.99. He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 runs and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068. Grace produced his season's highlight in the South v North match at The Oval when he made his highest career score to date of 268, having been dismissed by Jem Shaw for nought in the first innings. It was to no avail as the match was drawn. But the occasion produced a memorable and oft-quoted comment by Jem Shaw who ruefully said: \"I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes\".Rae, p.96."]}, {"page": "Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond", "response": ["* Harry Altham, A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin, 1962."]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Harry Altham, A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin, 1962."]}, {"page": "Douglas Jardine", "response": ["In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life for pupils at Winchester was arduous and austere; discipline was harsh. Sport and exercise were vital parts of the school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important.Douglas, pp. 6\u20139. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were \"taught to be honest, practical, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised.\"Douglas, p. 9. All pupils were required to be academically competent and as such Jardine was able to get along satisfactorily without exhibiting academic brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered.Douglas, p. 13. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a very fine cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football.Douglas, pp. 6, 13\u201314. But it was at cricket that he particularly excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers.Douglas, pp. 11\u201312. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team.Douglas, p. 15. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton had usually held the upper hand.Douglas, p. 11. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. Years later, after his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his personal favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.Douglas, pp. 17\u201318.Frith, p. 70."]}, {"page": "Middlesex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Harry Altham, A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin, 1962"]}, {"page": "Sydney Barnes", "response": ["Harry Altham wrote of Barnes' bowling: \"At appreciably more than medium pace he could, even in the finest weather and on the truest wickets in Australia, both swing and break the ball from off or leg.

After the war, he rejoined the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers.Swanton, p. 244. Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Unlike many of the cricketing Establishment, who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top-class facilities.Quelch, \"At last the 1948 show\", Location 673. In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951, which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with Harry Altham; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication.Swanton, pp. 248\u201349. In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator. In his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little opportunity to play cricket."]}, {"page": "Thomas Lord", "response": ["* Harry Altham, A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin, 1926."]}, {"page": "Articles of Agreement (cricket)", "response": ["In Harry Altham's history, he discusses the possibility of a so-called \"popping hole\" being in use in the early 18th century but disclaims it as \"a local and transitory variety of the regulation game\".

Blythe, who had complete mastery of flight and spin, bowled consistently to a full length and made effective use of his fingers at the point of delivery to determine if the ball would be an orthodox break or a late inswinger, either of which was a difficult ball to face on a pitch that helped the bowler. Although he was ostensibly a slow-paced bowler, Blythe sometimes bowled an \"arm ball\" which was decidedly fast and, in general, he had more pace than would be expected."]}, {"page": "Frank Woolley", "response": ["Writing for Barclay's World of Cricket, Harry Altham described Woolley as a \"tall and graceful\" figure who, with \"a quiet air\" was \"unhurried in his movements\". As a batsman, he had a gift for timing his shots and made full use of his long reach. He was especially strong in driving off his back foot against balls that other batsmen might consider good length deliveries. He was equally graceful as a bowler, making full use of his height to extract additional bounce from his deliveries. Altham pointed out that, although Woolley lacked the subtlety of Wilfred Rhodes, he was nevertheless a formidable bowler on any pitch whose conditions helped him. Woolley's long reach and his \"large, prehensile hands\" enabled him to take 1,018 catches, a total that remains a world record for non-wicketkeepers. Neville Cardus wrote that no other cricketer served \"the meadow game\" as happily and faithfully as Woolley."]}, {"page": "Maurice Read", "response": ["John Maurice Read (9 February 1859 \u2013 17 February 1929 in Winchester, Hampshire) was an English professional cricketer.
