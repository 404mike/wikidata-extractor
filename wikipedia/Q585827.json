Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had their own chart successes for Decca.

He then played bass for jazz-rock London group, Jett Blacks, a collective that included guitarist John McLaughlin. His big break came in 1962, when he was hired by Jet Harris and Tony Meehan of the successful British group The Shadows for a two-year stint. Shortly before hiring Baldwin, Harris and Meehan had just had a Number 1 hit with \"Diamonds\" (a track on which Jones' bandmate-to-be Jimmy Page had played.) Baldwin's collaboration with the Shadows nearly prevented the future formation of Led Zeppelin, when the parties engaged in talks about the possibility of Baldwin replacing their bassist Brian Locking, who left the band in October 1963, but John Rostill was ultimately chosen to fill the position."]}, {"page": "Bedworth", "response": ["*Brian Locking, (1938-2020) musician, one time member of The Shadows."]}, {"page": "Locking", "response": ["* Brian Locking (born 1938), rock guitarist"]}, {"page": "John Rostill", "response": ["John Henry Rostill (16 June 1942 \u2013 26 November 1973) was an English musician, bassist and composer, recruited by the Shadows to replace Brian Locking.", "Stylistically, Rostill combined the solidity of Brian Locking and the adventurousness of Jet Harris. Many of his bass lines were heavily syncopated and he developed a range of new sounds on the Burns bass during his time with the group, a longer period than Harris and Locking put together. To many players, Rostill was ahead of his time and included double-stopping in his technique. Unusually for that time, Rostill sometimes played bass finger-style as well as with a plectrum, depending on the sound he wanted."]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Brian Locking (The Shadows, Marty Wilde)"]}, {"page": "Marty Wilde", "response": ["From mid-1958 to the end of 1959, Wilde was one of the leading British rock and roll singers, along with Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard.
