Another term, \"primal religion,\" was coined by Andrew Walls in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. However, according to the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, such approaches preference Western industrialized people and the course of Protestant Enlightenment culture. Likewise, James Cox, Walls's student, argues that terms such as \"primal religion,\" \"primitive religion,\" and \"tribal religion\" suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity."]}, {"page": "Timothy Tennent", "response": ["Tennent studied under Professor John Brockington, Dr James Cox, and Professor Andrew Walls, and his research focused on the rapidly growing churches outside the West.
