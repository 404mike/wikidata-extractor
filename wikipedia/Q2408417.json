However, George D. Painter makes numerous references to the year 1491 in his book William Caxton: a biography as the year of Caxton's death, since 24 March was the last day of the year according to the calendar used at the time, so the year-change had not yet happened. Painter writes, \"However, Caxton's own output reveals the approximate time of his death, for none of his books can be later than 1491, and even those which are assignable to that year are hardly enough for a full twelve months' production; so a date of death towards autumn of 1491 could be deduced even without confirmation of documentary evidence.\"p.\u00a0188"]}, {"page": "Cabourg", "response": ["According to Marcel Proust's biographer George D.

In this case, the work is partially based on his own experiences and partially on the reports of his colleagues. George D. Painter, on the other hand, argued that de Bridia wrote the account based on a lecture given by Benedict of Poland, probably in Germany, since the manuscript tradition of the text is associated with the Upper Rhineland. Benedict's own De itinere was written in Cologne. Tadeusz Bie\u0144kowski argues for its composition in Breslau or Cracow, while others have suggested Prague. The friars did travel through Poland on their return journey, and Benedict had probably composed a draft of his own report by then. Gregory Guzman argues that Benedict must have given lectures in his native Polish, which de Bridia translated into Latin."]}]}}
