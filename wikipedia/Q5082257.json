S. Cockell, British Interplanetary Society, 2006 The project was international, involving over 25 scientists and engineers, co-ordinated by Charles S. Cockell. Pole Station was designed to operate for three summers and two polar winters. Amongst a diversity of scientific objectives the station occupants were to retrieve a deep core from within the Martian polar ice caps and search for water and habitable conditions deep in the polar ice cap. Expeditions were planned to numerous locations across the Martian north polar caps, including the Chasma Boreale and the polar layered terrains. The study involved wide-ranging investigations of the scientific priorities for a human presence at the Martian polar ice caps through to detailed architectural and design studies for the station. Studies were undertaken on mobility and communications and psycho-social issues for long-term operation at the Martian polar station."]}, {"page": "Forward to Mars Party", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles S.
