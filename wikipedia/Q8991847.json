Toward the end of the 2006/07 season there was speculation that Coakley's father was interested in buying the club, however this came to nothing and Coakley was released at the end of the season when his contract expired.

In the 64th minute, Dunfermline made their second substitution; Michael McGlinchey was replaced by Jim Hamilton and he had an almost immediate impact on the match, earning a penalty kick after being pushed by Anderson. Referee Smith initially awarded a free kick on the edge of the penalty area but changed his mind amid complaints from Dunfermline players and awarded a penalty kick instead. Stephen Glass took the penalty kick, hitting the ball past goalkeeper Main into the top corner of the goal to make the score 3\u20132. Dunfermline continued to pressure for an equalising goal and almost did so when St Johnstone defender Goran Stani\u0107 nearly scored an own goal after mis-hitting the ball but it rebounded off the crossbar.
