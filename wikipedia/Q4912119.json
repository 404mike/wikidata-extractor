It was revealed that Billy Armstrong had paid rent to his wife for his constituency office for a period up to 2007. Armstrong's office is a prefab, which stands beside his home, Prospect House near Stewartstown, County Tyrone.\nArmstrong officially opened a second Constituency Office at 20 High Street, Moneymore on Friday 6 March 2009, although this office has been serving the constituents of Mid-Ulster since 8 November.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of the 2nd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Billy Armstrong", "|Billy Armstrong"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": [":Billy Armstrong, Ulster Unionist MLA and father of Sandra Overend"]}, {"page": "William Armstrong", "response": ["* Billy Armstrong (born 1941), politician in Northern Ireland", "* Billy Armstrong (actor) (1891\u20131924), British actor"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Billy Armstrong", "|Billy Armstrong"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 3rd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Billy Armstrong", "|Billy Armstrong"]}, {"page": "Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=3|Billy Armstrong(UUP)"]}, {"page": "Sandra Overend", "response": ["Overend was born near Stewartstown, County Tyrone and educated at Cookstown High School and the University of Ulster.
