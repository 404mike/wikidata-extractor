In March 2014, Hanson spoke about new strike partner Aaron McLean's lack of goals for the club, while Hanson himself had scored 6 goals in 9 games. That same month Hanson was revealed as the player in 3 divisions of the Football League who had committed the most fouls in the 2013\u201314 season to date; he was defended by manager Phil Parkinson.
