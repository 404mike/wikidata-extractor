Other sources, however, such as the book The World of Scary Video Games, claim that the game lacks elements needed for a \"horror\" game, as the player hunts rather than is hunted by the Wumpus, and nothing in the game is explicitly intended to frighten the player, making it more of an early adventure or puzzle game. Kevin Cogger of 1Up.com claimed that Wumpus, whether or not it is an adventure game, \"introduced a number of concepts that would come to define the adventure genre\", such as presenting the game from the perspective of the player-character, and non-grid-based map design. In 2012, Hunt the Wumpus was listed on Times All-Time 100 greatest video games list. The Wumpus monster has appeared in several different forms of media, including a \"Hunted Wumpus\" Magic: The Gathering card, the 1983 video game M.U.L.E., and Cory Doctorow's 2011 novella The Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.

MacLeod is thanked in the Acknowledgements section: \"Many thanks to Ken MacLeod for letting me use IWWWW and 'Webbly.'\" Doctorow and Charles Stross also used one of MacLeod's references to the singularity as \"the rapture for nerds\" as the title for their collaborative novel Rapture of the Nerds (although MacLeod denies coining the phrase).
