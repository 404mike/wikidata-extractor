By the 1987\u201388 season he had become a regular in the side. However, when Howard Wilkinson succeeded Bremner as Leeds manager in 1988, the young centre-forward found himself surplus to requirements. Taylor believed that this was because Wilkinson wanted immediate success, and needed to bring in established, experienced players in order to achieve this. Thus in March 1989 Taylor moved to Bristol City, with Carl Shutt moving to Leeds as part of the deal."]}, {"page": "List of Old Edwardians (Sheffield)", "response": ["* Carl Shutt (born 1961) \u2013 former Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds United and Bradford City footballer"]}, {"page": "Andy Turner (footballer)", "response": ["On 21 June 2001, Turner signed with Gary Johnson's Conference club Yeovil Town.
