He is currently goalkeeping coach at Shanghai Shenhua.\nHe began his footballing career with Luton Town but left in 1984 without making a first-team appearance, and signed for Mansfield Town. He was at Field Mill for nine years, during which time he played a total of 109 competitive games. He helped Mansfield win promotion to the Third Division in 1986, although they were relegated back to the Fourth Division in 1991. Beasley was in the team when Mansfield won promotion to the new Division Two in 1992, but left after their relegation in 1993.\nEarly in the 1986\u201387, Beasley was loaned to Peterborough United (making seven Fourth Division appearances). He was also loaned to Bristol Rovers for the final weeks of the 1992\u201393 season, but played just one game and was unable to prevent their relegation from Division One.\nBeasley then signed for Doncaster Rovers and was their first choice goalkeeper in 1993\u201394, but after just one season was on the move again, this time to Chesterfield. He played more than 40 games for Chesterfield and oversaw their promotion to Division Two and surprise run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup before retiring from professional football on 31 May 1997.\nBeasley was goalkeeping coach at Nottingham Forest under manager Paul Hart in the early 2000s, and took up the same role at Leeds United as part of Dennis Wise's new look coaching team in 2006. His services were dispensed with on 1 February 2012 after manager Simon Grayson was sacked.On 29 November 2016, Beasley joined Chinese Super League side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, as a member of coaching staff to Gustavo Poyet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2008\u201309 Leeds United F.C. season", "response": ["*22 December: Assistant Manager, Steve Staunton parts company with the club following Gary McAllister's dismissal.
