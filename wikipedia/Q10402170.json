The third round draw saw an unusual number of contests between First Division clubs; twelve top-flight teams faced a fellow First Division club. Manchester City were among this number, with a home tie against six-time cup winners Blackburn Rovers. Manchester City won 3\u20131 in front of the largest crowd of the round. The Manchester Guardian described City's win as \"notable... ...for the surprising ease with which it was gained\". The wing play of Eric Brook and Ernie Toseland was central to the victory. Brook scored the first goal on a rebound after his shot from a free-kick was blocked. Blackburn then equalised, but Toseland scored either side of half-time to make the score 3\u20131. City were then drawn away against Second Division Hull City. Two quick goals shortly before half-time gave Manchester City a 2\u20130 lead, but Hull regrouped in the second half. First Jack Hill headed a goal from a corner, then, under pressure from Bill McNaughton, Bill Dale diverted a Hull cross into his own net for the equalising goal. Following the 2\u20132 draw, the Blues resoundingly won the replay 4\u20131. Sheffield Wednesday were the opponents in the Fifth Round. Once again a score draw was fought out. However, Manchester City won the replay by two goals to none. The Sixth Round was a home tie with Stoke City, a match seen by 84,569 fans, which is still the record highest attendance at an English club ground. The Potters were beaten 1\u20130, setting up an intriguing semi-final against Aston Villa, who had knocked out the three-time champions Arsenal in the previous round.
