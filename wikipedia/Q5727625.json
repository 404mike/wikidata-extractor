He grew up in Chilton, County Durham, and as a youth played for the Chilton School team. Robinson went on to assist Kirk Merrington, Shildon Athletic and Chilton Colliery Railway before joining Football League First Division side Sunderland on amateur terms in September 1929. Although he was awarded a professional contract the following month, he failed to break into the first team and spent the entire season playing with the reserves in the North Eastern League.Robinson left Sunderland in May 1930 and was signed by Third Division North club Nelson. He made his senior debut for Nelson in the opening match of the 1930\u201331 season, a 4\u20135 defeat away at Rochdale on 30 August 1930. Robinson scored his first Football League goal on 20 September 1930, netting his side's first in a 2\u20132 draw with New Brighton at Seedhill. He was on the scoresheet again four games later in the 2\u20134 defeat to Crewe Alexandra. Robinson kept his place in the first team for most of the first half of the season, although Archie Howarth and Tom Carmedy also played at outside-left occasionally. On 20 December 1930 he scored his third goal of the season, a penalty kick, in the 2\u20130 win against Wrexham. Nelson progressed to the second round of the FA Cup in the 1930\u201331 campaign and Robinson played in all three matches, scoring once. He made his final appearance for the club on 24 January 1931 as Nelson were beaten 0\u20132 at New Brighton.In February 1931, Robinson was released by Nelson along with several other players because of financial problems at the club. He spent the remainder of the season with Hartlepools United, where he scored one goal in six league games. In the summer of 1931 he returned to the North Eastern League with Spennymoor United. After spending the 1931\u201332 season with the County Durham club, Robinson was offered a short-term contract by Darlington. He signed for the Quakers in August 1932, marking a return to the Third Division North, but played only one first-team game before leaving the club the following month. Robinson subsequently had spells in non-League football with Crook Town and Horden Colliery Welfare before retiring from football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Robinson", "response": ["Henry Robinson may refer to:", "*Henry Robinson (writer) (c. 1604\u20131664), English writer on religious tolerance", "*Henry Robinson (scientist), Librarian of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and co-worker with John Phillips", "*Henry Robinson (bishop) (c. 1553\u20131616), Bishop of Carlisle, 1598\u20131616", "*Henry Robinson (clergyman) (1819\u20131887), Church of England clergyman ", "*Henry Robinson (Yorkshire cricketer) (1858\u20131909), cricketer", "*Henry Robinson (Nottinghamshire cricketer) (1863\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Henry Robinson (New South Wales cricketer) (1864\u20131931), New South Wales player", "*Henry Robinson (footballer) (1909\u2013?), English footballer", "*Sir Henry Robinson, 1st Baronet (1857\u20131927), Irish civil servant", "*Henry Robinson (spy) (1897\u20131944), intelligence agent of the Comintern murdered by the Gestapo"]}, {"page": "Archie Howarth", "response": ["Archie Howarth (March quarter 1911 \u2013 20 July 1966) was an English association footballer who played as an outside forward.
