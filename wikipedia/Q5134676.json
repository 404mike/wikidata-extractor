In pre-season for the 1989\u201390 season during a tour of Scotland, he displaced regular left-back Clive Stafford, impressing enough to earn him a run in the first-team during the opening games of the league season. However, after the defence leaked a number of goals, the inexperienced Rooke was one of the first players to be replaced. He made his final appearance for the club on 7 October 1989 in a heavy 4\u20130 away defeat to Aldershot. He made a total of four Football League appearances for the U's."]}]}}
