His parents were Ali R\u0131za Efendi, a militia officer originally from Kod\u017ead\u017eik, title deed clerk and lumber trader, and Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m. Only one of Mustafa's siblings, a sister named Makbule (Atadan) survived childhood; she died in 1956.  According to Andrew Mango, his family was Muslim, Turkish-speaking and precariously middle-class.Andrew Mango Atat\u00fcrk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey, Overlook Press, 2002, , p. 25-27, p.27ff. \u2013 \"Feyzullah's family is said to have come from the country near Vodina (now Edhessa in western Greek Macedonia). The surname Sofuzade, meaning 'son of a pious man', suggests that the ancestors of Z\u00fcbeyde and Ali R\u0131za had a similar background. Cemil Bozok, son of Salih Bozok, who was a distant cousin of Atat\u00fcrk and, later, his ADC, claims to have been related to both Ali R\u0131za's and Z\u00fcbeyde's families. This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue. This suggests that some at least of their ancestors had originally come from Turkey, since local Muslims of Albanian and Slav origin who had no ethnic connection with Turkey spoke Albanian, Serbo-Croat or Bulgarian, at least so long as they remained in their native land.

A more lasting multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP ceded the majority position to the Democratic Party. This came amidst arguments that Atat\u00fcrk's single-party rule did not promote direct democracy. The reason experiments with pluralism failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Atat\u00fcrk's biographer Andrew Mango writes: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat\u00fcrk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 536 Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, Atat\u00fcrk always supported the idea of building a civil society: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of his many speeches about the importance of democracy, Atat\u00fcrk said in 1933:", "In 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.Kinross, 401 As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq, and Atat\u00fcrk made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. The agreement left a large section of the Kurdish population and the Iraqi Turkmen on the non-Turkish side of the border.ASD: Speeches and statements by Atat\u00fcrk, volume I pages 361\u2013363 published by Atat\u00fcrk Culture, language and history Higher Institute, Ankara 1989Andrew Mango, Atat\u00fcrk and the Kurds, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20"]}, {"page": "Turkish Land Forces", "response": ["On August 26, 1922, the Army of the Grand National AssemblyTurkey, Office of the Prime Minister, Directorate General of Press and Information, 1993, p. 23.Andrew Mango, Turkey: Nations and Peoples Library New Nations and Peoples, Walker, 1968, p. 45.

This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue. This suggests that some at least of their ancestors had originally come from Turkey, since local Muslims of Albanian and Slav origin who had no ethnic connection with Turkey spoke Albanian, Serbo-Croat or Bulgarian, at least so long as they remained in their native land., But in looks Ataturk resembled local Albanians and Slavs.[...] But there is no evidence that either Ali Riza or Z\u00fcbeyde was descended from such Turkish nomads.\" page 28; \"It is much more likely that Atat\u00fcrk inherited his looks from his Balkan ancestors.[...] But Albanians and Slavs are likely to have figured among his ancestors.\"Lou Giaffo: Albania: Eye of the Balkan VortexJackh, Ernest, The Rising Crescent, (Goemaere Press, 2007), p. 31, Turkish mother and Albanian fatherIsaac Frederick Marcosson, Turbulent years, Ayer Publishing, 1969, p. 144.Richmond, Yale, From Da to Yes: understanding the East Europeans, (Intercultural Press Inc., 1995), 212.

In 1950, the Republican People's Party released the majority position to the Democratic Party after losing the 1950 elections. There are arguments that Kemal did not promote direct democracy by dominating the country with his single party rule. The reason behind the failed experiments with pluralism during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Mustafa Kemal's biographer Andrew Mango said: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat\u00fcrk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 536 Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of eventually building a civil society; a system of totality of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions that form the basis of a functioning society as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state.
