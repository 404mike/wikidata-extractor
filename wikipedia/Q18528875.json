A few women in St. Louis (among whom there was Amabel Anderson Arnold, director of the Woman's Department at the University of Chicago Law School, the first woman holding such office in the United States) organized a visit for Edith Arnold to the city and raised funds to cover her charge and the rent of a hall. Her lecture took place on April 11 of that year. It was from this visit that the St. Louis Equal Suffrage League was formed. Conservative society did not talk of suffrage and even when the Equal Suffrage League was established, it was with a cautious tone, emphasizing education rather than action. Members preferred to be called suffragists instead of suffragettes to downplay any militant activity. Ten women dared to take a stance on the suffrage movement and establish the Equal Suffrage League. The founding members were Mrs. Robert Atkinson, Miss Marie Garesche, Mrs. E.M. Grossman, Miss Lillian Hetzell, Miss Jennie A.M. Jones, Mrs. D.W. Knefler, Miss Bertha Rombauer, Mrs. Russell, Mrs. Florence Wyman Richardson and her daughter, Mrs. Roland Usher.", "The Equal Suffrage League brought many speakers to St. Louis to speak on suffrage, issued press reports, organized street meetings, and established branch organizations in the St. Louis area. Some of the speakers that the group brought to the city were Ethel Arnold, the Honorable and Mrs. Philip Snowden of England, Mrs. Lucia Ames Mead of Boston, Professor Schmidt of Cornell, Professor Frances Squire Potter of Chicago, and Professor Earl Barnes of Philadelphia. On November 3, 1911, the league invited Emmeline Pankhurst to lecture at the Odeon, the largest hall in the city. The theatre nearly reached capacity. Her lecture helped to assuage fears of the ill effects of suffrage regarding feminine grace and refinement."]}, {"page": "Julia Huxley", "response": ["Arnold was born in 1862 to Julia Sorell, the granddaughter of William Sorell and Thomas Arnold, a literary scholar.
