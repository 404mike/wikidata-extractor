Then they started to take off and move in lots of directions. That's what we want.\" Less than two months after the album's release, Turner declared that Sheffield-inspired songwriting was \"a closed book\": \"We're moving on and thinking about different things.\" Years later, Turner said that the attention during this period made him \"a bit frightened or nervous\": \"We shut a lot of people out, just to try to keep some sort of control.\" The band turned down many promotional opportunities and quickly released new material \u2013 a five-track EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? in April, and a stand-alone single, \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\", in August. That summer, the band made the decision to permanently replace Nicholson, who had taken a touring break due to \"fatigue\", with Nick O'Malley, another childhood friend.

In an interview with NME, Nick O'Malley announced several songs including \"D is for Dangerous\" and \"Balaclava\". The tracks \"The Bakery\" and \"Plastic Tramp\" also mentioned in the NME interview did not make it onto the album, but were later released as B-sides on the \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" single. The track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was also rumoured for inclusion, but did not make the final cut.", "The music on Favourite Worst Nightmare has been characterised as post-punk revival, indie rock, and garage rock, and post-Britpop. In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\", being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album.  The album arguably has influences from The Smiths \u2013 \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\" Matt Helders said \"James was DJing loads in the evening so we'd go out and [...] have a dance.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG. The band's love of classic films also influenced their new style. For example, the organ at the beginning of the album's final track, \"505\" is replicating Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff).", "* Nick O'Malley \u2013 bass, vocals"]}, {"page": "Brianstorm", "response": ["* Nick O'Malley \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "List of musicians from Sheffield", "response": ["*Nick O'Malley"]}, {"page": "1985 in British music", "response": ["*5 July - Nick O'Malley, musician (Arctic Monkeys)"]}, {"page": "List of Rickenbacker players", "response": ["* Nick O'Malley of Arctic Monkeys"]}, {"page": "O'Malley (surname)", "response": ["* Nick O'Malley (born 1985), indie-rock musician"]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by Arctic Monkeys", "response": ["Arctic Monkeys are a British indie rock band from Sheffield, England.
