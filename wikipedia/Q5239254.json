Early in the 2006\u201307 he was given a Birmingham squad number because of an injury to first choice keeper Maik Taylor, and was an unused substitute in their Championship match at Cardiff City. In October 2006 he joined Oldham Athletic on loan where he acted as backup to Les Pogliacomi, making one substitute appearance in the Football League Trophy. He then joined Macclesfield Town on loan and was expected to go straight into the starting eleven due to injury and suspension, but manager Paul Ince chose goalkeeping coach David Rouse instead, and Legzdins completed his month's loan without appearing for the club. He played an active part in helping Birmingham reserves to the championship of the Central League Division One Central in 2006\u201307."]}, {"page": "Jack Butland", "response": ["Butland remained with Stoke in the Championship in the 2018\u201319 season. He played 45 times, missing a league match only once, after the birth of his son, and kept 18 clean sheets, the third best in the Championship behind Dean Henderson and Darren Randolph. He was named as player of the season by supporters. Butland began the 2019\u201320 season in poor form, making several mistakes most notably against Preston North End on 21 August 2019. He was replaced by Adam Federici for the next two league matches, re-taking his place at the start of September. He made another mistake against Nottingham Forest on 27 September 2019 and didn't play again under Nathan Jones. He was reinstated by new manager Michael O'Neill and he worked with a new goalkeeping coach, David Rouse which helped him regain some of his form. The season was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown Butland participated in a campaign making phone calls to vulnerable supporters. The season returned in the summer and Butland sustained a neck injury against Leeds on 9 July, with Adam Davies taking his place for the remainder of the season as Stoke finished in 15th."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| David Rouse"]}, {"page": "Rouse, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Rouse"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Al Ain FC season", "response": ["| David Rouse"]}]}}
