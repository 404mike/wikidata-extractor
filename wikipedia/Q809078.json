Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\" In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\" The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand.

In Britain, Michael Hollingshead opened the World Psychedelic Centre and Beat Generation poets Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso read at the Royal Albert Hall. Miles adds: \"The readings acted as a catalyst for underground activity in London, as people suddenly realized just how many like-minded people there were around. This was also the year that London began to blossom into colour with the opening of the Granny Takes a Trip and Hung On You clothes shops.\" Thanks to media coverage, use of LSD became widespread."]}, {"page": "Yoko Ono", "response": ["Lennon and Ono were injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road. According to journalist Barry Miles, a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album.

His graduation picture appears in the school's yearbook.  His claims to have never attended school \u2013 and his general disavowals of education \u2013 may have been related to his experience of dyslexia which, although never officially diagnosed, was obvious to sidemen such as John French and Denny Walley, who observed his difficulty reading cue-cards on stage, and his frequent need to be read aloud to.French, J. Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic   While attending Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, Van Vliet became close friends with fellow teenager Frank Zappa, the pair bonding through their interest in Chicago blues and R&B. Van Vliet is portrayed in both The Real Frank Zappa Book and Barry Miles' biography Zappa as fairly spoiled at this stage of his life, the center of attention as an only child. He spent most of his time locked in his room listening to records, often with Zappa, into the early hours in the morning, eating leftover food from his father's Helms bread truck and demanding that his mother bring him a Pepsi.  His parents tolerated such behavior under the belief that their child was truly gifted. Vliet's \"Pepsi-moods\" were ever a source of amusement to band members, leading Zappa to later write the wry tune \"Why Doesn't Someone Give Him A Pepsi?\" that featured on the Bongo Fury tour."]}, {"page": "Sgt.

In a 1969 interview with Barry Miles, however, Lennon said he was depressed and that while McCartney was \"full of confidence\", he was \"going through murder\".

In 1995, George Harrison said that Rubber Soul was his favourite Beatles album, adding: \"we certainly knew we were making a good album. We did spend more time on it and tried new things. But the most important thing about it was that we were suddenly hearing sounds that we weren't able to hear before.\" Ringo Starr described it as \"the departure record\" and said that the music was informed by the band members \"expanding in all areas of our lives, opening up to a lot of different attitudes\"."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner cites 1966 as the start of the band's \"psychedelic period\", as do musicologists Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc. Schaffner adds: \"That adjective [psychedelic] implies not only the influence of certain mind-altering chemicals, but also the freewheeling spectrum of wide-ranging colors that their new music seemed to evoke.\" Music journalist Carol Clerk describes Revolver as having been \"decisively informed by acid\", following John Lennon and George Harrison's continued experimentation with the drug LSD since the spring of 1965. Available at Rock's Backpages  (subscription required). Through these experiences, the two musicians developed a fascination for Eastern philosophical concepts, particularly regarding the illusory nature of human existence. Despite his bandmates' urging, after Ringo Starr had also partaken of the drug, Paul McCartney refused to try LSD. Intent on self-improvement, McCartney drew inspiration from the intellectual stimulation he experienced among London's arts scene, particularly its thriving avant-garde community. With Barry Miles as his guide, he became immersed in the nascent British counterculture movement, which soon emerged as the underground.", "According to Simon Philo, Revolver announced the arrival of the \"underground London\" sound, supplanting that of Swinging London. Barry Miles describes the album as an \"advertisement for the underground\", and recalls that it resounded on the level of experimental jazz among members of the movement, including those who soon founded the UFO Club. He says it established rock 'n' roll as an art form and identifies its \"trailblazing\" quality as the impetus for Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and for Brian Wilson to complete the Beach Boys' \"mini-symphony\", \"Good Vibrations\". Citing composer and producer Virgil Moorefield's book The Producer as Composer, author Jay Hodgson highlights Revolver as a \"dramatic turning point\" in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the \"performability\" of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners' preconceptions of a pop recording. In his review for Pitchfork, Plagenhoef says that the album not only \"redefin[ed] what was expected from popular music\", but recast the Beatles as \"avatars for a transformative cultural movement\". MacDonald cites Revolver as a musical statement that, further to the Rubber Soul track \"The Word\" and \"Rain\", helped guide the counterculture towards the 1967 Summer of Love due to the widespread popularity of the Beatles.MacDonald, Ian. \"The Psychedelic Experience\".

These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock, music hall and psychedelic music. The only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus many of the songs were written and first performed on that instrument.

Shep then arranged an audition for the band with composer and renowned record producer Frank Zappa, who was looking to sign bizarre music acts to his new record label, Straight Records. For the audition Zappa told them to come to his house \"at 7 o'clock.\" The band mistakenly assumed he meant 7 o'clock in the morning. Being woken up by a band willing to play that particular brand of psychedelic rock at seven in the morning impressed Zappa enough for him to sign them to a three-album deal. Another Zappa-signed act, the all-female GTOs, who liked to \"dress the Cooper boys up like full size Barbie dolls,\" played a major role in developing the band's early onstage look.Barry Miles's biography of Frank Zappa includes a vivid description of how the GTO's influenced Cooper to wear makeup and dress in drag onstage."]}]}}
