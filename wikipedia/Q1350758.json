Miami: Warner Bros. Publications, 1994. While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\"Corgan, Billy. \"Guitar Geek USA\" column. Guitar World, January 1996. This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect.

Flanagan said that he plays \"with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not\"; he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom-toms positioned on either side of him, contrasting with how they are traditionally used.Flanagan (1996), pp. 208\u2013209 Mullen occasionally rides a tom-tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal, or rides the hi-hat how others would play a snare. He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength, as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate drumming elements together on a full kit. As a result, he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum. He said, \"I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives.\" He was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the 1970s when first learning to play drums. In the early days of U2, Mullen had what Bono called a \"florid\" drumming style, before he eventually adopted a philosophy of simplicity and pared down his rhythms. His drumming leaves open space, owing to what Modern Drummer described as his understanding of \"when to hit and when not to hit\".

Pretty Hate Machine was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording Pretty Hate Machine mostly by himself.", "In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey commended Reznor for giving \"industrial music a human voice, a point of connection\" with his \"tortured confusion and self-obsession\", and felt that \"the greatest achievement of Pretty Hate Machine was that it brought emotional extravagance to a genre whose main theme had nearly always been dehumanization.\" Upon its 2010 reissue, Will Hermes of Rolling Stone called it \"the first industrial singer-songwriter album\" and commended the sound produced by Flood and Keith LeBlanc, who he said \"taught Reznor a lot.\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V.

So we ended up with this unwritten agreement in the band, where we'd all throw together a few ideas at the beginning of a track.

According to Flood, they did not do a substantial amount of work in Milan, except for the song \"Personal Jesus\", which was crucial in setting the tone and spirit of the album. \"Everybody was feeling each other out, because they wanted to try working in a different way.

Mullen was excited about working with them again, as he felt the pair, Lanois in particular, were the band's first producers who \"really [took] an interest in the rhythm section\". Mark \"Flood\" Ellis was selected to be the recording engineer for the sessions, marking the first time he worked with U2. The band were impressed by his work with Nick Cave, and Bono's friend Gavin Friday recommended Flood based on their work experiences together when Friday was a member of the Virgin Prunes. U2 asked Flood for a sound that was \"very open... ambient... with a real sense of space of the environment you were in\", which he thought was a very unusual request at that time.", "U2's initial time at Danesmoate was spent recording and refining \"extensive demos\" that the Edge anticipated could turn into final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, but rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton.Graham (1996), p. 28 The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: \"Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 [synthesiser]\u2014it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when they walked into the room.\"Jobling (2014), pp. 149\u2013150 One of the first songs worked on was \"Heartland\", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times\u2014one producer for a week or two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.", "As the sessions progressed, U2 attempted to record a suitable take of the song \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", which began as a demo that the Edge had composed by himself. However, the group struggled with the chord and time signature shifts, forcing significant \"screwdriver work\" to fix a recorded version of the song. Eno estimated approximately 40% of the time spent on The Joshua Tree was dedicated to that song alone. During takes, Lanois used a pointer and a chalkboard to help walk the band through the song's changes. In an attempt to force the group to start anew, Eno intended to \"stage an accident\" whereby the song's tapes would be erased. According to Flood, engineer Pat McCarthy had to restrain Eno to prevent this from happening. Ultimately, the erasure never occurred. Another aspect of the album that required re-work was Bono's lyrics. The vocalist had another set of lyrics for most of the record, but the other group members were dissatisfied with them, forcing rewrites.Jobling (2014), p. 164 Lanois said the production team extensively screened Bono's lyrics and offered suggestions, as many lines did not sound as good when sang against a backing track as they did when written down. Bono's revised lyrics were described as \"absolutely stunning\" by Meegan, who believed that the insecurity the singer felt from having his work critiqued further motivated him.", "The final weeks were a frantic rush to finish, with the band and production crew all suffering from exhaustion. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes, as they had other commitments. Facing understaffing, in late December, U2 hired Steve Lillywhite, producer of their first three albums, to remix the potential singles and make them more appealing to commercial radio. His eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Of the approximately 30 songs that were created during the album's sessions, 11 were selected for the final track listing. Lillywhite mixed four songs with engineer Mark Wallis on an SSL desk at Windmill Lane Studios. At the same time, Lanois, McCarthy, and Meegan mixed seven songs at Melbeach on a 24-track AMEK 2500 mixing desk; all three were required to operate the console due to the lack of mix automation.", "On 2 June 2017, the album was reissued in several formats in commemoration of its 30th anniversary.

It was produced by Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, and was released on 3 March 1997 on Island Records. The album was a continuation of the band's 1990s musical reinvention, as they incorporated alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences into their sound. Pop employed a variety of production techniques that were relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing.", "Recording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the record was completed, they felt rushed into delivering it. Even after delaying the album's release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio, working up to the last minute to complete songs.", "For the new record, U2 wanted to continue their sonic experimentation from Achtung Baby and Zooropa. To do so, they employed multiple producers to have additional people with whom to share their ideas. Flood was principal producer, having previously worked with the group as engineer for The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, and co-producer of Zooropa. Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Howie B were principal engineers. Flood described his job on Pop as a \"creative coordinator\", saying, \"There were some tracks where I didn't necessarily have a major involvement... but ultimately the buck stopped with me. I had the role of the creative supervisor who judged what worked and didn't work.\" Howie B had previously provided mixing, treatments, and scratching for Original Soundtracks 1. On Pop, he was initially given the role of \"DJ and Vibes\" before assuming responsibilities as co-producer, engineer, and mixer. One of his main tasks was to introduce the band to sounds and influences within electronica. The band and Howie B regularly went out to dance clubs to experience club music and culture. The overall goal for the record was to create a new sound for the band that was still recognisable as U2.", "U2 began work on Pop in mid-1995, collaborating with Nellee Hooper in London, France, and Ireland. In September, the band moved the recording sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse.McCormick (2006), p. 265. The studio was designed to be more of a rehearsal space more than an actual studio. Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and Marius de Vries joined Hooper and the band there, each of them incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance music. Flood described Howie's influence thus: \"Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That could be anything from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also programmed drum loops, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling. U2 arrive in the studio with very little finished material.\" These sessions lasted until December 1995, and around 30\u201340 pieces of music emerged during this period.", "Following Mullen's return and the sessions' resumption in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work much of the band's material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, \"We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So you have to try to get the groove and the song, and do it so that it sounds like the band, and do it so that it sounds like something new.\"", "During the recording sessions, U2 allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming PopMart Tour before they had completed the album, putting the tour's start date at April 1997.McCormick (2006), p. 270. The album was originally planned to be completed and released in time for the 1996 Christmas and holiday season, but the band found themselves struggling to complete songs, necessitating a delay in the album's release date until March 1997. Even with the extended timeframe to complete the album, recording continued up to the last minute. Bono devised and recorded the chorus to \"Last Night on Earth\" on, coincidentally, the last night of the album's recording and mixing. When Howie B and the Edge took the album to New York City to be mastered, changes and additions to the songs were still being made. During the process, Howie B was adding effects to \"Discoth\u00e8que\", while the Edge was recording backing vocals for \"The Playboy Mansion\". Of the last minute changes, the Edge said, \"It's a sign of absolute madness.\" Flood says, \"We had three different mixes of 'Mofo', and during mastering in November '96 in New York, I edited a final version of 'Mofo' from these three mixes. So even during mastering, we were trying to push the song to another level. It was a long process of experimentation; the album didn't actually come together until the last few months.\"", "Pop features tape loops, programming, sequencing, sampling, and heavy, funky dance rhythms. The Edge said in U2's fan magazine Propaganda that, \"It's very difficult to pin this record down. It's not got any identity because it's got so many.\" Bono has said that the album \"begins at a party and ends at a funeral\", referring to the upbeat and party-like first half of the album and sombre and dark mood of the second half. According to Flood, the production team worked to achieve a \"sense of space\" on the record's sound by layering all the elements of the arrangements and giving them places in the frequency spectrum where they did not interfere with each other through the continual experimenting and re-working of song arrangements.", "Clayton's bass guitar was heavily processed, to the point that it sounded like a keyboard bass (an instrument utilized on \"Mofo\"). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob twiddling. Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, \"You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music\u2014without him having to go to 11 all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out.\"", "\"Mofo\" is the most overtly techno track on the record. Bono's lyrics lament the loss of his mother. There are little guitar and vocal samples that the band played and the production team sampled. They selected the bits that they liked, and then Edge played them back in a keyboard. Pop's producer Flood also put some of guitar work through the ARP 2600 on this track.", "\"Gone\" features a \"siren\" effect from Edge's guitar, complex krautrock style drums from Mullen and a funk-inspired bass line. This track was also considered for release as a single. Flood applied VCS3 spring reverb and ring modulation in a few places, and used it a lot on the basic rhythm track of this song.", "\"The Playboy Mansion\" starts out with mellow, wah-wah guitar playing from Edge. Along with Mullen's drumming, there are breakbeats and hip-hop beats on the rhythm track, which were recorded as loops by Mullen. Howie described the loops thus; \"Larry went off into a side room and made some sample loops of him playing his kit, and gave the loops to me and Flood. It was the same with the guitars; there's a guitar riff which comes in the verse and chorus, which is a sample of Edge playing.\" Bono's lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek account of pop culture icons.", "\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\" features a mellow, dark atmosphere. Marius De Vries played keyboards on this track, contributing to the ambient feel. Mullen uses brush stroke style drums for the most part. When news first broke of U2's work in the studio, it was reported the band were recording a trip hop album; writer Niall Stokes believes that \"The Playboy Mansion\" comes close to the assertion due to Hooper's heavy hand.Stokes (1997), p. 131. Flood stated that Hooper \"started things off\" but did not finish the track due to his time constraints. Bono reworked this song as a lounge-jazz piece for the 2002 Jools Holland album Small World Big Band Volume Two.", "\"Please\" features Bono lamenting The Troubles and the Northern Irish peace process, pleading with the powers that be to \"get up off their knees\". Mullen uses martial-style drumming, similar to \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". Flood put guitar work through the ARP 2600 on the song. He explains, \"For ages the rhythm track played all the way through the track. It's a fairly tight groove/bass thing, and then we suddenly decided to drop out the rhythm section in the middle and add a load of strings and these weird synthetic sounds at the end of that break.\" The single releases and live performances of the song were different from the album version, with more prominent guitar playing and a guitar solo to end the song.", "* Flood\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboards", "Category:Albums produced by Flood (producer)"]}, {"page": "St Olave's Grammar School", "response": ["*Mark Ellis, known as \"Flood\", record producer (U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers)"]}, {"page": "Nitzer Ebb", "response": ["David Gooday left after the tour and they completed their next album Belief (1989) as a duo.

The record was a continuation of the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991.", "The group employed Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark \"Flood\" Ellis\u2014both of whom worked on Achtung Baby\u2014to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable.Graham (2004), p. 51 Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust and to which he could add his own personality. Initially, the band did not have a clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, \"I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album.\" The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: \"We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool.\"", "Soon after the sessions commenced, Bono pushed for the band to work towards a full-length album. The Edge was initially hesitant, but saw the opportunity as a challenge to quickly record an album before returning to tour and prove the band had not become spoiled by the luxury of ample recording time. Additionally, Bono and the band's manager Paul McGuinness had discussed the possibility of releasing a \"one-two punch\" of records since the beginning of the Achtung Baby sessions. In early March, U2 reached a consensus to work towards a full-length album.McGee (2008), p. 159 Much like they had for the Achtung Baby sessions, the band split work between two studios at once; Adams operated a Soundtracs mixing console at The Factory, while Flood used an SSL console at the newly relocated Windmill Lane Studios.", "Due to the time limit, U2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace. They continued their long-time practice of jamming in the studio. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed; he pointed at chords and various commands, such as \"hold\", \"stop\", \"change\", and \"change back\", to direct their performances.Flanagan (1996), pp. 183\u2013190 Flood recorded the material, while Eno alternated between performing with U2 and joining Flood in the control room. At the end of a given week, Eno and Flood compared their notes and compiled the week's best jams onto a cassette for the band to listen to. The producers edited together their favourite sections of the jams and then discussed the arrangements with the group. U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called \"fatting\", which allowed them to achieve more than 48\u00a0tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a Fostex D20 timecode-capable DAT recorder, and an Adams Smith Zeta Three synchroniser; Adams went through 180 two-hour DAT tapes during the recording sessions. The production crew faced issues with audio spill at The Factory, as all group members recorded in the same room as the mixing desk and Bono frequently sang in-progress lyrics that would need to be replaced. Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers' sounds as much as possible.", "As May's \"Zooropa\" tour leg approached, U2 continued to record while simultaneously rehearsing for the tour. Their time limit prevented them from working on live arrangements for any of the new songs.Flanagan (1996), pp. 227\u2013228 Despite the sessions' rapid pace, the album was not completed by the time they had to resume touring. Moreover, Flood and Eno had to begin work on other projects. The Edge remembers everyone was telling the group, \"Well, it's an EP. You did good but there's a lot more work needed to finish some of these songs.\" However, the band did not want to shelve the project, as they believed they were on a \"creative roll\" and that they would be in a completely different frame of mind if they revisited the material six months later.", "The group's solution was to fly back and forth between Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process \"about the craziest thing you could do to yourself\", while Mullen said of it, \"It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad.\" McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant \"there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing\". Flood called the period one of \"absolute lunacy\".Stokes (2005), p. 116 Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a \"live performance\" attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, \"a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel.\" Flood had to depart about a week prior to the completion of mixing due to prior obligations to produce Nine Inch Nails in Los Angeles.
