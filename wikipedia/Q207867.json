He was the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division and recorded two albums with the group: Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980). Curtis was known for his bass-baritone voice, dance style and songwriting typically filled with imagery of desolation, emptiness and alienation.\nCurtis suffered from epilepsy and depression and took his own life on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour and shortly before the release of Closer. Shortly after his death, the three surviving members of the band reconstituted themselves as New Order. Continuing a stylistic shift towards a more electronic sound that characterized Joy Division's later releases, New Order would eventually achieve considerable commercial and critical success in their own right. They remain an active unit to this day, albeit without Joy Division bassist Peter Hook, who left the band in the mid-2000s due to personal disputes with the other members.\nDespite their short career, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence. John Bush of AllMusic argues that they \"became the first band in the post-punk movement by ... emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s\". According to critic Simon Reynolds, Joy Division's influence has extended from contemporaries such as U2 and The Cure to later acts including Interpol, Bloc Party and Editors. Rap artists such as Danny Brown and Vince Staples have cited the band as an influence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cheshire", "response": ["Cheshire has produced notable musicians such as Rick Astley, Joy Division members Ian Curtis and Stephen Morris, One Direction member Harry Styles, the members of The 1975, Take That member Gary Barlow, The Cult member Ian Astbury,Larkin, Colin (2011) The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Bish Bash Books, , p. 461 Catfish and the Bottlemen member Van McCann, Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts, Stephen Hough, John Mayall,John Mayall biographical details.  www.johnmayall.com website.

In February 1980, Melody Maker qualified the same band as \"masters of this Gothic gloom\". Critic Jon Savage would later say that their singer Ian Curtis wrote \"the definitive Northern Gothic statement\". However, it was not until the early 1980s that gothic rock became a coherent music subgenre within post-punk, and that followers of these bands started to come together as a distinctly recognizable movement. They may have taken the \"goth\" mantle from a 1981 article published in UK rock weekly Sounds: \"The face of Punk Gothique\", written by Steve Keaton. In a text about the audience of UK Decay, Keaton asked: \"Could this be the coming of Punk Gothique? With Bauhaus flying in on similar wings could it be the next big thing?\" The F Club night in Leeds, which had opened in 1977 firstly as a punk club, became instrumental to the development of the goth subculture in North England in the 1980s. In July 1982, the opening of the Batcave in London's Soho provided a prominent meeting point for the emerging scene, which would be briefly labelled \"positive punk\" by the NME in a special issue with a front cover in early 1983. The term Batcaver was then used to describe old-school goths."]}, {"page": "July 15", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Ian Curtis, English singer-songwriter and guitarist (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Joy Division were  an English rock band formed in Salford in 1976. The group consisted of vocalist Ian Curtis, guitarist/keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.", "On 4 June 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\". The following day Hook borrowed \u00a335 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\"", "The suicide shocked the band and their management. In 2005, Wilson said: \"I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen\u00a0... We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were.\" Music critic Simon Reynolds said Curtis's suicide \"made for instant myth\". Jon Savage's obituary said that \"now no one will remember what his work with Joy Division was like when he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous\". In June 1980, Joy Division's single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, Closer was released, and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, \"Closer is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have.\"", "The band's dark and gloomy sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as \"dancing music with Gothic overtones\", presaged the gothic rock genre. While the term \"gothic\" originally described a \"doomy atmosphere\" in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included \"high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role\" and \"vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.\"", "Joy Division have been dramatised in two biopics. 24 Hour Party People (2002) is a fictionalised account of Factory Records in which members of the band appear as supporting characters. Tony Wilson said of the film, \"It's all true, it's all not true. It's not a fucking documentary,\" and that he favoured the \"myth\" over the truth. The 2007 film Control, directed by Anton Corbijn, is a biography of Ian Curtis (portrayed by Sam Riley) that uses Deborah Curtis's biography of her late husband, Touching from a Distance (1995), as its basis. Control had its international premiere on the opening night of Director's Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically well received.

Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music.The album Trans-Europe Express was played over the PA before Joy Division's concerts. New Order's song \"Your Silent Face\" also has some similarities with \"Europe Endless\" and had a working title of \"KW1\", or \"Kraftwerk 1\". New Order also recorded a song called \"Krafty\" that appeared as a single and on the album Waiting for the Sirens' Call. New Order also sampled \"Uranium\" in its biggest hit \"Blue Monday\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of \"Hall of Mirrors\" on their 1987 album Through the Looking Glass, which was lauded by Ralf H\u00fctter: \"In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of 'Hall of Mirrors' by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary, just like the arrangements of Alexander B\u0103l\u0103nescu for his Balanescu Quartet release [of Possessed, 1992]. We also like the album El Baile Alem\u00e1n of Se\u00f1or Coconut a lot.\" Members of Blondie have admitted on several occasions that Kraftwerk were an important reference for their sound by the time they were working on their third album Parallel Lines. The worldwide hit \"Heart of Glass\" turned radically from an initial reggae-flavoured style to its distinctive electronic sound in order to imitate the technological approach of Kraftwerk's albums and adapt it to a disco concept. U2 recorded a cover version of \"Neon Lights\" as did Simple Minds. U2 included \"Neon Lights\" as the B-side of their 2004 single \"Vertigo\". Simple minds included theirs on an all-cover tunes album by same name. LCD Soundsystem song called \"Get Innocuous!\" is built on a sample of \"The Robots\". Rammstein also covered their song \"Das Modell\", releasing it as a non-album single in 1997. John Frusciante cited the ability to experiment of the group as an inspiration when working in a recording studio.
