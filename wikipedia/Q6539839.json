Borrell first enlisted Swedish-born guitarist Bj\u00f6rn \u00c5gren via an advert in the NME, who then introduced fellow-Swede bassist Carl Dalemo to Borrell. Borell then brought in school friend Sh\u00efan (formerly Christian) Smith-Pancorvo on drums, and they rehearsed in east London for six months before playing their first gig on 17 September 2002 at Dingwalls in Camden, London supporting the Von Bondies.
