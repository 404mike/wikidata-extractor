He played at representative level for Great Britain and England, and at club level for St. Helens (Heritage \u2116 715), and Wigan (Heritage \u2116 604), as a wing or centre, i.e. number 2 or 5, or, 3 or 4.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Frank Carlton"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2009", "response": ["*Frank Carlton, 72, English rugby league player."]}, {"page": "Jan Prinsloo", "response": ["Jan Prinsloo was signed by St. Helens on 14 October 1958, he scored his first try for St. Helens as part of a two-try d\u00e9but against Rochdale Hornets on Saturday 8 November 1958. During the 1958\u201359 season Prinsloo scored hat-tricks against Salford and Blackpool Borough for a season total of 27-tries from 31 games. Prinsloo played a vital part in finishing dazzling moves for many a St. Helens victory including the sensational 1959 Championship Final win by 44 points to 22 over a great Hunslet side where Prinsloo exhibited a fabulous touchline dash rounded off with his trademark 'swallow dive' over the try-line. During the 1959\u201360 season Prinsloo scored 4-tries against Liverpool City and a hat-trick of tries against Hull FC, finishing the season with 29-tries from 38 matches. The following year brought more success with a hat-trick of tries against Workington Town, his last match for St. Helens was against Warrington on Saturday 7 January 1961. The transferring of both Prinsloo to Wakefield Trinity and Frank Carlton to Wigan paved the way for a \u00a311,000 World Record transfer to bring Mick Sullivan to Knowsley Road. Prinsloo had the daunting task of wearing the St. Helens number five jersey at the same time as Tom van Vollenhoven was setting the whole game on fire on the other wing. His record and strike-rate demonstrates what a fine finisher Prinsloo was in rugby league. He made his d\u00e9but for Wakefield Trinity during February 1961, and he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during the 1962\u201363 season."]}]}}
