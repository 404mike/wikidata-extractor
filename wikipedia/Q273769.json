The scale is defined in Hounsfield units (symbol HU), running from air at \u22121000 HU, through water at 0 HU, and up to dense cortical bone at +1000 HU and more.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 12", "response": ["*2004 \u2013 Godfrey Hounsfield, English biophysicist and engineer, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "August 28", "response": ["*1919 \u2013 Godfrey Hounsfield, English biophysicist and engineer Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "Radiation therapy", "response": ["With Godfrey Hounsfield\u2019s invention of computed tomography (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy. The advent of new imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1970s and positron emission tomography (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) tomotherapy. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects."]}, {"page": "1919", "response": ["* August 28 \u2013 Godfrey Hounsfield, English electrical engineer and inventor, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "1979", "response": ["* Medicine \u2013 Allan MacLeod Cormack, Godfrey Hounsfield"]}, {"page": "2004", "response": ["* August 12 \u2013 Godfrey Hounsfield, English Nobel electrical engineer and inventor (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "CT scan", "response": ["The history of X-ray computed tomography goes back to at least 1917 with the mathematical theory of the Radon transform.
