He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf; profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society, he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903.Beyond his work in engineering, Bell had a deep interest in the emerging science of heredity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 2", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Alexander Graham Bell, Scottish-Canadian engineer, invented the telephone (b. 1847)"]}, {"page": "Alexander", "response": ["*Alexander Graham Bell (1847\u20131922), Scottish inventor of the first practical telephone"]}, {"page": "Convex uniform honeycomb", "response": ["The alternated cubic honeycomb is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic close-packing of spheres.

However, little danger of confusion exists, because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the decibel (dB), for signal strength and sound pressure level measurements, while a unit for one-tenth of a byte, the decibyte, and other fractions, are only used in derived units, such as transmission rates."]}, {"page": "Bell (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Alexander Graham Bell (1847\u20131922), Scottish-Canadian-American inventor, teacher, engineer, and scientist, son of Alexander Melville Bell", "* Bell Telephone Company, founded in 1877 by the family of Alexander Graham Bell"]}, {"page": "Bell Labs", "response": ["In 1880, when the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs (approximately US$10,000 at that time; about $ in January 2019's dollars) for the invention of the telephone, he used the award to fund the Volta Laboratory (Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory) in Washington, D.C. in collaboration with Sumner Tainter and Bell's cousin Chichester Bell.Bruce, Robert V.
