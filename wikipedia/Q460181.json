In China, he served twice as commander-in-chief of British forces.\nBorn in Portsea, Portsmouth, Bremer joined the Royal Naval College as a student in 1797. While serving in the East Indies, he became commander of HMS Rattlesnake in 1807. He was promoted to captain in 1814 and was nominated a CB the following year. After becoming commander of HMS Tamar, he was sent to Melville Island, Australia, in 1824 to establish a colony. Under his leadership, the north coast of Australia from 129\u00b0 to 135\u00b0 longitude was claimed as British territory. He also led the Battle of Berbera in 1827.Bremer served twice as commander-in-chief of British forces in the First Anglo-Chinese War from 1839 to 1841. During the war, he took formal possession of Hong Kong Island for the United Kingdom in 1841. He was made a KCB the same year. In 1846, he was appointed with Sir Francis Augustus Collier to the joint command of the Channel Squadron and became commodore-superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard from which he retired in 1848.
