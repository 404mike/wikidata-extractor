After the accession of James II he was made chamberlain to the queen, Mary of Modena, and, along with Rochester and Sunderland, enjoyed the king's special confidence. In 1687 he was named commissioner of the treasury. Although Parliament had voted to grant James II \u00a36,000,000, Godolphin was involved in the payment of approximately \u00a3125,000 to James II by Louis XIV, in return for James's support for Louis. The historian David Ogg has written that \"James and his two ministers, Rochester and Godolphin, were prepared to barter the independence of England for a sum little more than a sixtieth part of that granted by the national legislature\".David Ogg, England in the Reigns of James II and William III (London: Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 158."]}, {"page": "The Secret of the Unicorn", "response": ["Another individual known as Captain Haddock had lived in this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at M\u00e1laga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where he was ordered to forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months."]}, {"page": "James II of England", "response": ["Historical analysis of James II has been somewhat revised since Whig historians, led by Lord Macaulay, cast James as a cruel absolutist and his reign as \"tyranny which approached to insanity\". Subsequent scholars, such as G. M. Trevelyan (Macaulay's great-nephew) and David Ogg, while more balanced than Macaulay, still characterised James as a tyrant, his attempts at religious tolerance as a fraud, and his reign as an aberration in the course of British history.See Prall, vii\u2013xv, for a more detailed historiography. In 1892, A. W. Ward wrote for the Dictionary of National Biography that James was \"obviously a political and religious bigot\", although never devoid of \"a vein of patriotic sentiment\"; \"his conversion to the church of Rome made the emancipation of his fellow-catholics in the first instance, and the recovery of England for catholicism in the second, the governing objects of his policy.\""]}, {"page": "Maurice Ashley (historian)", "response": ["Ashley was educated at St Paul's School and New College, Oxford, where he won the Stanhope Essay Prize (1928, 'Republicanism in the reign of Charles II') and the Gladstone Memorial (1930, 'The rise of Latitudinarianism in the Church of England'),Oxford University Calendar 1932, Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1929, pp.160, 167 and achieved first-class honours in Modern History in 1929.Oxford University Calendar 1932, Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1929, p.278 He went on to take a DPhil, studying under David Ogg, and it was his doctoral thesis that became Financial and Commercial Policy Under the Commonwealth Protectorate.Woolrych, Austin. \"Obituary: Maurice Ashley\", The Independent, 4 October 1994.
