In response, an angry Dirsken told Halifax that Germany's policy had always been seeking peacefully to revise the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had no intention of invading Poland and Halifax had fallen victim to anti-German hysteria in believing otherwise. Dirksen often reported to Berlin the British efforts to built a \"peace front\" to be blocked by the question of including the Soviet Union. On 27 May 1939, Chamberlain told the House of Commons that the cabinet had instructed Sir William Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, to open discussions on a military alliance.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 490. Dirken reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that Chamberlain had opened the talks with the Soviets \"with the greatest reluctance\" and that he was not keen on an alliance with the Soviet Union. Dirksen reported that the British had learned about the \"German feelers in Moscow\" and were \"afraid that Germany might succeed in keeping Soviet Russia neutral or even inducing her to adopt benevolent neutrality. That would have meant the complete collapse of the encirclement action\"."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Russia", "response": ["|Sir William Seeds||1939||1940||rowspan=\"6\"|King George VI"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Venezuela", "response": ["* 1925\u20131926: William Seeds"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Brazil", "response": ["*1930\u20131935: Sir William Seeds"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Colombia", "response": ["*1923\u20131926: William Seeds"]}, {"page": "List of Old Rugbeians", "response": ["*Sir William Seeds KCMG, Ambassador to Brazil 1930\u20131935; and Ambassador to Russia 1939\u20131940"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Albania", "response": ["* 1926\u20131928: William Seeds"]}, {"page": "Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission", "response": ["* William Seeds (Britain) (May 1928 - 12 December 1929)"]}, {"page": "Sir William Seeds", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Seeds"]}, {"page": "Joseph Addison (diplomat)", "response": ["Addison's obituary in The Times has been quoted above.
