He made his senior debut for the club on 12 September 1949 for the visit to Stoke City, taking the place of Scottish winger Ian Wilson, who had worn the number 7 shirt two days earlier in the defeat to Derby County. Burnley drew 1\u20131 at Stoke, Reg Attwell equalising with a penalty kick after the home side had taken the lead in the first minute of the game.Simpson (2007), pp. 254\u2013255 Henderson was dropped in favour of Jack Spencer for the next match against West Bromwich Albion and was subsequently forced to wait another month for his second first-team appearance. His second and ultimately final league outing for Burnley came in the 0\u20131 defeat away at Fulham on 15 October 1949, after which regular outside right Jackie Chew returned to the team and kept his place for much of the remainder of the season. Henderson remained at Turf Moor for another season, but played solely for the reserve team and was released in May 1951.Simpson (2007), p. 497"]}]}}
