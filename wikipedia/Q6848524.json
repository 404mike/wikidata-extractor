A left-footed player, he spent his entire professional career with Plymouth Argyle, having joined from local non-league club Saltash United in 1960. He made his first team debut two years later, in November 1962 and was used sporadically over the next five seasons. He established himself as the club's first choice left back towards the end of his career before departing in 1970. His successor was Colin Sullivan, a player who was also born in Saltash, that Reeves recommended to the club. He then moved to South Africa to play for Germiston Callies, who were managed by Micky Lill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saltash United F.C.", "response": ["* Mike Reeves"]}, {"page": "Reeves (surname)", "response": ["* Mike Reeves (footballer), English football player", "* Mike Reeves (baseball), Canadian baseball player"]}, {"page": "Mike Reeves", "response": ["Mike Reeves may refer to:", "* Mike Reeves (footballer)", "* Mike Reeves (baseball)"]}]}}
