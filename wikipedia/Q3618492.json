He was noted as a tough tackling defensive midfielder, though at times this led to him to having a poor disciplinary record. Born in England, he represented the Montserrat national team. \nImpressing at non-league Halifax Town, he turned professional with Doncaster Rovers in 2005. Used sparingly in 2005\u201306, he was loaned out to Oxford United in March 2006, though did not make it onto the pitch. In 2006\u201307 he was loaned out to Darlington and Stafford Rangers, before he spent the 2007\u201308 campaign on loan at Halifax Town. In April 2008 he signed with Port Vale, and became a first team regular in 2008\u201309. He remained a key first team figure in 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311, and was voted the club's Player of the Year in 2010. He continued to impress for the \"Valiants\", and earned a move up a division to Leyton Orient in May 2012. He returned to Port Vale on loan in March 2013, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313, before re-joining on a permanent basis in the summer. He signed with Shrewsbury Town in August 2014, before moving on to Carlisle United in January 2015. Six months later he signed for Altrincham before retiring in September 2015 due to a hip injury. He came out of retirement to sign for Glossop North End in September 2016. In 2017 he played for Trafford, Colwyn Bay, and Congleton Town.\nHe served as Congleton Town's joint-manager from November 2019 to April 2020.

However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign.", "In preparation for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed to replace the departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place \u2013 far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month."]}, {"page": "Frank Sinclair", "response": ["Sinclair began working as Stoke City's under-23 assistant manager in December 2016. He joined Radcliffe as assistant to manager Jon Macken in September 2017. He began coaching at Port Vale in March 2020, following an invite from assistant manager Dave Kevan. He was appointed as the club's head of coaching development five months later, saying that \"I see a key part of my role as bridging the gap between the younger players and the first team\". Interim manager Danny Pugh had to start self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 on 18 January 2021, leaving Sinclair, Billy Paynter and Anthony Griffith to take over first-team duties in his absence. The team lost both games in Pugh's absence, much to Sinclair's frustration. Sinclair left Vale Park at the end of the 2020\u201321 season. He joined Doncaster Rovers as an academy coach in October 2021."]}, {"page": "Cameron Jerome", "response": ["Jerome was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and is of Grenadian descent.

Griffith and Jerome also played for Yorkshire Counties. Jerome later joined home town club Westend Juniors before moving on to Huddersfield Town as a junior, then moved on via Grimsby Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough to gain a contract at Cardiff City, after being recommended by reserve team manager Paul Wilkinson. Jerome played under Wilkinson in Grimsby's youth system, but after Wilkinson left Blundell Park to take up his position with Cardiff in October 2003, Jerome was released by replacement Neil Woods for being a disruptive influence."]}, {"page": "Congleton Town F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Anthony Griffith|| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Coach"]}, {"page": "Delroy Facey", "response": ["Port Vale and Montserrat international midfielder Anthony Griffith is a cousin of Facey's."]}, {"page": "Billy Paynter", "response": ["Paynter was appointed as an academy football coach at Everton in February 2018 and also spent six months as a coach at RIASA.

He was appointed as club captain, after impressing in the pre-season. At twenty one years of age, and new to the club, his appointment came as a surprise to some, especially with more senior options in Sam Stockley, Marc Richards and Gareth Owen. However, Adams had faith in the young midfielder's vocal abilities and general leadership qualities. Putting in solid performances in Vale's unbeaten start to the season, he took to the field despite still suffering with an ankle injury. His first goal for the club seemed to come in a 4\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. However, after the match Marc Richards claimed the last touch and therefore took the credit for the goal. Fraser seemed to attract violence; on 25 August, Sheffield Wednesday's Francis Jeffers was sent off for head-butting Fraser, two weeks later Fraser and Aldershot Town captain John Halls almost came to blows before the match had even begun. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained club captain and a first team regular though, striking up a midfield pairing with Anthony Griffith, who he also shared a house with. His performances as captain earned him public praise from assistant manager Geoff Horsfield, though the fans were critical at times of his inconsistency. He found himself the new focus of disgruntled supporters in early 2010, following Danny Glover's demotion to the reserves, and Marc Richards' rising goal tally. Fraser vowed to ignore the booing. He also retained the captain's armband for the next season, and vowed \"to be more mature both on and off the pitch\" in order to be a better captain.", "At the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Fraser set the club a goal of promotion, saying that \"I won't be happy until I've achieved promotion with Port Vale\". The strong performances of Anthony Griffith and Gary Roberts left only an unfamiliar wide role for Fraser, and a minority of fans became dissatisfied with his performances on the wing and again began booing the young captain. Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and was replaced by Jim Gannon. Two weeks into Gannon's reign Fraser left the club by mutual consent so as to find first team football, preferring this option to a loan deal."]}, {"page": "Doug Loft", "response": ["During the 2013\u201314 season, Loft had been a regular fixture in the first-team, scoring nine goals in 43 league and cup appearances, until April 2014, when an alleged training ground altercation between Loft and teammate Daniel Jones left Loft out of action for the remainder of the season. Manager Micky Adams stressed that Loft was the innocent party in the confrontation that left Loft with a broken cheekbone and Jones was sacked following a club investigation. He was voted onto Port Vale's team of the 2010s by readers of The Sentinel, alongside Anthony Griffith, in February 2020."]}, {"page": "Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["He received interest from Micky Adams' Port Vale, and joined the club on trial in July 2010. Acknowledging \"it's a last-chance saloon\", Roberts said \"I've learnt just not to be a plonker for all my life.\" He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed \"I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as I wake up clean that's all that I need\". He signed a six-month contract at the end of the month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1\u20130 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was \"no substance\" to the report. In fact he went on to say \"he has a huge part to play\" in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts. Gannon's reign was quickly terminated, but Roberts still struggled to regain his form under caretaker-manager Mark Grew."]}, {"page": "Chris Lines", "response": ["Lines signed a one-year contract with newly promoted League One side Port Vale in July 2013. In the first part of the 2013\u201314 season he began tracking back to help his defence whilst also being the key playmaker in central midfield, after a discussion with manager Micky Adams. He scored his first goal for the \"Valiants\" with a \"superb free-kick\" from 25-yards in a 1\u20130 win over Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 29 September. He went on to build a partnership in midfield with Anthony Griffith, who provided tough-tackling skills whilst Lines played as a creative playmaker. He signed a new two-year contract in June 2014. He said that the good team spirit at the club was a major factor in him signing the contract."]}, {"page": "Lee Sinnott", "response": ["To make a success of the 2008\u201309 season, Sinnott brought in former Hereford United defender John McCombe, and former Middlesbrough midfielder Steve Thompson. Both players cited Sinnott as their reason for joining the club. He also added experienced defender Sam Stockley (Wycombe Wanderers); attacker Rob Taylor (Nuneaton Borough); midfielder Anthony Griffith (Doncaster Rovers); and attacking midfielder Louis Dodds (Leicester City) to the squad. Lee Collins also joined on an extended loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and would sign a permanent contract with the club in January. He appointed Stockley as his captain. The team continued to struggle, and on 18 September Sinnott admitted that \"we are looking to improve, without a shadow of a doubt\". However a 4\u20131 home defeat to Macclesfield Town two days later would prove to be Sinnott's last game in charge. He was sacked two days later, with the \"Valiants\" lying in 16th place. Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009. The club went on to finish the season in 18th place under Dean Glover. Despite the poor results Vale picked up during his reign, many of Sinnott's signings would become key players for the club over the next few seasons."]}, {"page": "List of association football families", "response": ["* Delroy Facey, Danny Facey (brother)  Anthony Griffith (cousin)"]}, {"page": "Adam Yates (footballer)", "response": ["Targeted by manager Dean Glover, Port Vale continued the hunt for his signature even after Glover's departure. Yates decided to wait until a manager was appointed before signing for the club, and after Micky Adams was made manager Yates signed a two-year deal with the Vale. He was forced to wait until 22 August before he made his competitive debut for the club, as Sam Stockley had impressed in the right-back position in the pre-season and opening few games of the 2009\u201310 season. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. Following Stockley's retirement in November, Yates was expected to fill the void, though he faced competition for the right wing-back spot from Anthony Griffith. In his first game in almost a month he scored his first goal at Vale Park, scoring the opener of a 1\u20131 draw with Stevenage Borough in the FA Cup First Round. By February 2010 he was managing to maintain a first-team place, helped by the team's change of formation from 3\u20134\u20133 to 4\u20134\u20132."]}, {"page": "Griffith (surname)", "response": ["*Anthony Griffith, English-born Montserrat international football player"]}, {"page": "Port Vale F.C.
