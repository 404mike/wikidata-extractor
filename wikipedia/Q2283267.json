The monument was completed in 1931/32, unveiled in 1935, and soon removed in 1939 by the National Socialists to be melted down for the purpose of making weaponry. Lessing was in Vienna in 1775/76, had an audience with Joseph II.,Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Translated by H. B. Nisbet, Philosophical and Theological Writings Cambridge University Press, 2005, . and was therefore in a position to influence and shape the Viennese cultural climate. Lessing's \"Ringparabel\" in the drama \"Nathan der Weise\" is considered a key text of the Enlightenment and helped in the formulation of the idea of tolerance. From 1962 to 65, Charoux created a second Lessing monument out of bronze, that was unveiled at Ruprechtskirche in 1968 and moved to Judenplatz in 1981.Hedwig Abraham, Siegfried Charoux: Bildhauer, 1896 - 1967  accessed 18 May 2007.
