In 1991, his debut guitar instrumental album The Magician was released by President Records. Following disillusionment with the music industry, Parga shied away from the scene until he re-emerged in Los Angeles in 1998, playing guitar on Graham Bonnet's The Day I Went Mad.Considered by many to be one of the greatest sweep arpeggio players of the guitar 'shred'  and neoclassical metal genres, Parga combines complex arpeggio patterns with rapid alternate picking, Sweep-picking and string bending. Mario was listed in the July '08 edition of the international magazine Guitar World as being one of the World's 50 fastest guitarists (alternate picking technique) based on a scientific note clocking experiment. Despite his amazing speed, he is also renowned for his highly emotive slower playing.In 2000, Parga was approached by the guitar label Liquid Note Records and recorded his instrumental 'Valse Diabolique'  for their The Alchemists album. Two years later, he recorded his haunting ballad 'Hourglass'  for Lion Music's Warmth in the Wilderness II, a tribute to fellow guitarist Jason Becker.\nEarly in 2007, Parga announced the creation of his own record label 'MidnightCafe Music', (the name taken from his track 'The Midnight Caf\u00e9' from The Magician) and plans on releasing his future instrumental rock guitar music through it. His long-awaited album Entranced was released on the label on 14 April 2007.Mario Parga lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States with his wife Shawna and their daughter Skye.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cozy Powell", "response": ["Powell worked with Gary Moore in 1988, followed by stints with Black Sabbath from 1988 to 1991, and again in 1994\u20131995. Between late 1992 and early 1993, Powell put together an occasional touring band using the old band name 'Cozy Powell's Hammer' featuring himself on drums, Neil Murray on bass, Mario Parga on guitar and Tony Martin on vocals and occasional rhythm guitar/synth module. The band performed throughout Europe and appeared on German television. Powell made headlines in 1991 when he appeared on the BBC children's programme Record Breakers, where he set a world record for the most drums (400) played in under one minute, live on television."]}, {"page": "Lytham St Annes", "response": ["Notable musicians, actors and, entertainers who were born or live(d) in Lytham St Annes include entertainer George Formby, comedians Les Dawson and Roy Walker, comedian and broadcaster Jenny Eclair, actors Stephen Tompkinson, Jonas Armstrong, Dean Lennox Kelly and Craig Kelly, composer Peter Dickinson, guitarist Mario Parga, drummer with Alien Sex Fiend and UFX/Uncle Fester Ratfink (Andrew Wilson),  variety hall entertainer Betty Jumel, singer-songwriter Marli Harwood and Gigwise.com founder Andy Day.

K. Downing, Frank Gambale & Mario Parga). Similarly, some kinds of licks are easier when played using such specialized techniques as legato, economy picking (a hybrid of alternate and sweep picking) or tapping."]}, {"page": "Tony Martin (British singer)", "response": ["|Mario Parga"]}, {"page": "Mario parga", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mario Parga "]}, {"page": "The Day I Went Mad", "response": ["The Day I Went Mad is the sixth solo album by English rock singer Graham Bonnet, originally released in 1999.
