Renamed as Stars in a Rallycross Car, the segment featured a longer interview process, with two celebrities invited to the show for each episode (as had happened before in Series 11), before taking to a new circuit in a modified Mini Cooper that had been prepared for rallycross driving. The new rallycross circuit provided for the remade segment, incorporated parts of the existing Top Gear Test Track, such as the use of \"Gambon\", but included two new off-road sections, which featured a water splash obstacle and a jump; the existing circuit received a cosmetic update to the line markings \u2013 still used for \"Power Laps\".

Despite his defence, the show received fewer viewers throughout the series, with the final episode achieving overnight figures of around 1.9 million viewers, a new recorded low in the show's history compared to that made by an episode featuring the former hosts, which attracted 2.36 million on 15 June 2003.
