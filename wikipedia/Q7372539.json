Ipswich were in charge early on in the match and saw an early chance from Crawford go wide as he failed to convert Jimmy Leadbetter's cross.  Ipswich's Inside forwards were covering a lot of ground in both attack and defence, and this soon took its toll as Tottenham remained patient and took the lead through Greaves in the 36th minute.  Peter Baker's pass to Bobby Smith was flicked into space for Greaves to run on and shoot past Ipswich's goalkeeper Roy Bailey.  Five minutes later Smith's backheel from a Greaves pass deceived Ipswich defender Andy Nelson, and Smith doubled Tottenham's lead, who went in 2\u20130 at half-time.  The second half saw Tottenham's veteran defensive midfielder Danny Blanchflower move up the pitch and provided space for his forwards, with John White's pass allowing Greaves to slip the ball past Bailey for 3\u20130.  An injury to Ipswich defender Larry Carberry left the East Anglian club even weaker; Greaves beat five players only to slice his shot wide of the target after side-stepping Bailey.  With less than ten minutes remaining, White headed in from a Terry Medwin pass.  Roy Stephenson scored a late consolation goal for Ipswich but Medwin completed Tottenham's scoring, with a shot following a pass from Greaves to end the match 5\u20131.", "|GK ||1 || Roy Bailey"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Roy Bailey"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["September started with a trip to the Hawthorns where Ipswich faced West Bromwich Albion.

A fourth consecutive victory followed as Ipswich beat Birmingham City 4\u20131 which included another brace from Phillips, one of which was a  strike.  After a mid-week League Cup victory over Manchester City, Ipswich faced Everton at Goodison Park: goalkeeper Wilf Hall stood in for injured Roy Bailey to make his debut in a First Division match.  In blustery conditions, Derek Temple scored a hat-trick as Ipswich were beaten convincingly 5\u20132 with consolation goals from Phillips and Moran. Two days later, Ipswich travelled to Ewood Park and secured a late point with a 2\u20132 draw thanks to a 75th minute goal from Phillips, his second of the match.  The ball rebounded off his face after being punched clear by Blackburn's goalkeeper Brian Reeves.
