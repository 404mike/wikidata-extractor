But his tastes led him to the study of ancient works of art and historical costume, and he became a highly skillful antiquarian draughtsman. When the wall paintings in St. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, were discovered in 1800, Smirke made a set of facsimile copies of them in watercolours, on a small scale, which are now in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries; he was afterwards employed by the society on similar work. He gave much time to the study of chemistry, and made some discoveries in the qualities of colour. He died at the Howard Arms Inn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Smirke (painter)", "response": ["Of his sons, Richard Smirke (1778\u20131815), was a notable antiquarian artist.
