He qualified for five European Tour events over 2017, failing to make it past the Last 32 in any of them, meaning he did not qualify for the European Championships. He made a third Players Championship semi-final of the year in the final weekend in Barnsley, where he knocked out Ross Twell, Ian White, Kevin Painter, Peter Jacques and Michael Smith, before a 6\u20132 defeat to Adrian Lewis. This was enough for him to qualify for the Players Championship Finals, as the 29th seed. Wattimena started off with a 6\u20130 hammering of Keegan Brown, where he averaged almost 97. He saw off Mickey Mansell 6\u20133 in the next round to move into his first major TV Last 16 appearance.
