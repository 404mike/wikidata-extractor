This work was originally untitled but has since been referred to as \"Four Pieces\". Cast in copper, it occupies the major part of the wall, high on the southern side of the banking chamber. Another major sculpture was a free standing aluminium and fibreglass figure by Donald Brook, also \"Untitled\". This was installed in 1965 in the roof garden but was removed when the atrium was converted to office accommodation and now resides with the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery."]}, {"page": "Lesley Dumbrell", "response": ["In 1969 the Bonython Gallery in Sydney hosted Dumbrell's first solo exhibition, alongside her husband Lenton Parr, Bryan Westwood, and Don Driver. Critic Donald Brook described her 'ambiguous abstract figures': \"Their subdued tonality coaxes the eye with a persuasive gentleness that is surprisingly agreeable after so much occular [sic] assault by painting of this kind.\""]}, {"page": "Helen Ogilvie", "response": ["Ogilvie returned to Australia in 1963 where the subjects of her paintings and drawings continued to be humble rural buildings which she was aware were disappearing; in an interview she bemoaned the lack of protection given such relics in Australia, compared to the UK. While many Australian artists continued to follow European and international trends, Ogilvie devoted her art to Australian subjects, determined to create a new tradition of Australian printmaking and artistic practice. Reception of her paintings in Australia however, as opposed to her earlier prints, was lukewarm; Donald Brook in reviewing her 1968 Macquarie Galleries solo describes them as 'sweet and stiff'.Donald Brook, 'Painters demonstrate', The Sydney Morning Herald Thursday 03 Oct 1968, p.9 By the late 1970s she was producing little work but remained interested in the art world. The last of her solo exhibitions that she was able to attend opened at aGOG (Australian Girls' Own Gallery), Canberra, on her 89th birthday, 4 May 1991."]}]}}
