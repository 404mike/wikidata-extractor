Born in London, Knight learnt to play the violin and mandolin as a child before going to the Royal Academy of Music from 1960 to 1964. The recordings of the Irish fiddler Michael Coleman inspired him to take part in Irish pub sessions. He teamed up with guitarist and singer Bob Johnson until 1970 when he joined Steeleye Span. The parting was short-lived, as Johnson himself also joined Steeleye Span in 1972.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Lee", "response": ["With his operatic bass voice, Lee sang on The Wicker Man soundtrack, performing Paul Giovanni's composition, \"The Tinker of Rye.\" He sang the closing credits song of the 1994 horror film Funny Man.

The Village Wait (1970). While recording the album, the five members were all living in the same house, an arrangement that produced considerable tensions particularly between Hart and Prior on the one hand and the Woodses on the other. Terry Woods maintains that the members had agreed that if more than one person departed, the remaining members would select a new name, and he was upset that this did not happen when he and Gay Woods left the band. Gay and Terry were replaced by veteran folk musician Martin Carthy and fiddler Peter Knight in a longer-term line-up that toured small concert venues, recorded a number of BBC Radio Sessions, and recorded two albums \u2013 Please to See the King (1971) and Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again (1971).  While the first album was traditionally performed \u2013 guitars, bass and with two guest drummers \u2013 Please to See the King was revolutionary in its hard electric sound and lack of drums.", "In 1971, the then Steeleye Span line-up minus Maddy Prior contributed to two songs on Scottish folk musician Ray Fisher's album The Bonny Birdy; Martin Carthy and Ashley Hutchings were also involved in the selection and arrangement of some songs released on this album, whilst Ashley Hutchings wrote the sleeve notes. Furthermore, Martin Carthy and Peter Knight performed on four songs released on Roy Bailey's eponymous debut album in 1971.", "While they would never regain the commercial success of All Around My Hat, Steeleye remained popular among British folk rock fans and generally respected within the music industry. It has been widely reported that Peter Knight and Bob Johnson left the band to work on another project together, The King of Elfland's Daughter. The actual situation was more complex.  Chrysalis Records agreed to allow Knight and Johnson to work on \"King\" only as a way to persuade the duo to continue working with Steeleye. Since the record company had no interest in \"King\" for its own sake, it made no effort to market the album.  Chrysalis' ploy failed, however, and Knight and Johnson quit.", "For a while the band consisted of just Peter Knight and Tim Harries, plus various guest musicians, as they fulfilled live commitments.  This was an uncertain time for the future of the band, and when Harries announced he was not keen to continue his role, even the willingness of Kemp to return to the line-up full-time was not enough to prevent an 18 month hiatus while Peter Knight and the bands manager, John Dagnell, considered whether it was worth continuing.", "===Peter Knight leaves / Dodgy Bastards album===", "In November 2013 Peter Knight announced that he would be leaving Steeleye Span at the end of 2013.
