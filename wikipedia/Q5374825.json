His uncle, Henry Lascelles Carr, was a founder and editor of the Western Mail, based in Cardiff, and he saw promise in Emsley, and summoned him to work as a journalist on the newspaper. In 1891, Lascelles Carr was part of a syndicate which purchased the News of the World, a London-based Sunday newspaper with a small circulation, and he decided to appoint his nephew as its new editor.Emsley married Lascelles' daughter, Jenny Lascelles Carr, in 1895, and worked closely with George Riddell to build up sales of the News of the World.  This was highly successful; by 1900, the paper was selling more than one million copies of each issue.  Carr also continued to write for the Western Mail, acting as its chief political correspondent until the 1930s, using his membership of the Parliamentary lobby to obtain stories.During World War I, Carr undertook extensive charity work, in support of captured Welsh soldiers. He also undertook several trips to see the war for himself, visiting France and Scapa Flow, and reporting on the Paris Peace Conference.  In the 1918 New Year Honours, he was knighted for his wartime efforts.After the war, the News of the World continued to gain sales, reaching more than four million by 1940. Carr served as High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1938, as Chairman of the Press Gallery at Parliament in 1930/1, and President of the Institute of Journalists in 1932/3.  He also sponsored various sporting events, the Emsley Carr Mile being named in his honour some years after his death.  His son, Harry, was a cricketer who also worked alongside his father as a journalist at the News of the World.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "News of the World", "response": ["Before long, the News of the World established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper, with initial sales of around 12,000 copies a week. Sales then suffered because the price was not cut following the abolition of newspaper taxes and the paper was soon no longer among the leading Sunday titles, selling around 30,000 by 1880, a greater number but a smaller proportion, as newspaper sales had grown hugely. The title was sold by the Bell family in 1891 to Henry Lascelles Carr who owned the Welsh Western Mail. As editor, he installed his nephew Emsley Carr, who held the post for 50 years. The real engine of the paper's now quick commercial success, however, was George Riddell, who reorganised its national distribution using local agents. Matthew Engel, in his book Tickle the Public: One Hundred Years of the Popular Press (Gollancz, 1996), says that the News of the World of the 1890s was \"a very fine paper indeed\". The paper was not without its detractors, though. As one writer later related:", "The paper's motto was \"All human life is there\". The paper's name was linked with sports events as early as 1903 when the golfing tournament The News of the World Match Play Championship began (now under British PGA auspices). The News of the World Darts Championship existed from 1927 on a regional basis and became a national tournament from 1947 to 1990. There was also a News of the World Championship in snooker from 1950 to 1959 which eclipsed the official professionals' competition for a number of years. In athletics, the Emsley Carr Mile race was started in 1953 in memory of the former editor, and is still run annually. The paper's Football Annual was a long-standing publication (sponsoring it until 2008), and a Household Guide and Almanac was also published at one time.", "*1891: Emsley Carr"]}, {"page": "Carr (name)", "response": ["*Emsley Carr (1867\u20131941), British editor"]}, {"page": "Winston Churchill as writer", "response": ["When demand was high for his newspaper and magazine articles, Churchill employed a ghostwriter.David Lough, No More Champagne: Churchill and his Money (London: Head of Zeus, 2015) During 1934, for example, Churchill was commissioned by Collier's, the News of the World, the Daily Mail - and, added that year, the Sunday Dispatch, for which the newspaper's editor, William Blackwood, employed Adam Marshall Diston to rework Churchill's old material (Churchill himself would write one new piece in every four published by the Dispatch). Later in the year, when Churchill had less time to write, at the recommendation of Blackwood he employed Diston directly as his ghostwriter. Diston wrote, for example, Churchill's remaining Collier's articles for the year, being paid \u00a315 from the \u00a3350 commission Churchill received for each article. Blackwood considered Diston a 'splendid journalist' and his first article written for Churchill went to print without change - this, according to David Lough, 'was the start of a partnership that would flourish for the rest of the decade'. By the end of the following year, Diston had already prepared most of Churchill's 'The Great Men I Have Known' series for the News of the World in Britain and Collier's in the USA, due to appear from January 1936.
