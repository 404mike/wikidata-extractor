He has been editor of the architecture journal Blueprint, and has written for the Evening Standard (London) and The Guardian. In 2002 he succeeded Lucy Musgrave as director of the Architecture Foundation, leaving to concentrate on journalism full-time in 2008.

The main theme of its architecture is the sense of movement;  Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. Hadid took inspiration from the surrounding orthogonal site grids to determine the overall form. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as \"bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called  \"confluence, interference and turbulence\",", "The Riverside Museum (2004\u20132011), on the banks of the River Clyde Glasgow, Scotland, houses the Glasgow Museum of Transport. Hadid described the 10,000-square metre building, with 7,000 square metres of gallery space, as \"a wave\", \"folds in movement\", and \"a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde.\" Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with zinc plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, high overhead, so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of  The Guardian of London wrote: \"Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness.\"", "Hadid described her Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as \"inspired by the fluid geometry of water in movement\". The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminium and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports;  it is in the form of a parabolic arch that dips in the centre, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At \u00a3269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. Rowan Moore of The Guardian said that the roof \"floats and undulates\" and called the centre \"the Olympics' most majestic space\"."]}, {"page": "List of critics", "response": ["*Rowan Moore"]}, {"page": "Charles Robert Ashbee", "response": ["*2016 - Rowan Moore on The Future of London"]}, {"page": "Robin Hood Gardens", "response": ["Before the final announcement, the designs for replacement buildings were condemned in The Observer as \"generic developers' fare, with... no sense of place\".Rowan Moore, Robin Hood Gardens: don't knock it\u2026 down, The Observer, 3 December 2010.

This intrusion onto her design infuriated Gray, who considered the murals outright vandalism. In 2013, the architecture critic Rowan Moore said of the painting of the murals that \"As an act of naked phallocracy, Corbusier's actions are hard to top...\", adding that Le Corbusier was \"seemingly affronted that a woman could create such a fine work of modernism\" so he \"asserted his dominion, like a urinating dog, over the territory\".

He questioned its ability to draw people's attention to Stratford after the Games, in a similar manner to the successes of the Angel of the North or the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. He also questioned the piece's ability to strike a chord like the Angel, which he believed had at least \"created a feelgood factor and sense of pride\" in Gateshead, or whether it would simply become one of the \"many more unloved rotting wrecks that no one has the nerve to demolish\".

Paul Hayward of The Telegraph described it as \"imposing and extravagant, yes, but still true to Tottenham Hotspur's spirit and raison d'\u00eatre\".  The Observer's architecture critic Rowan Moore, despite being unimpressed by the \"ugliness\" of its external appearance, chose it as one of the top five buildings of 2019, arguing that the stadium is at its best as a venue for watching football, and that it has achieved \"the desired combination of magnificence and intimacy\". Similarly David Hytner of The Guardian noted that while the stadium is significantly larger, it still has the \"feeling of intimacy\" due to the closeness of the stands to the pitch, and that the design of the stadium has managed to \"retain the feel of the old White Hart Lane\". Henry Winter of The Times offered the opinion that the new stadium has shown the other clubs \"the quality of spec required\" for a new stadium, and one that can produce the loudest sound for the fans. He also noted the significance of the new stadium within the community in Tottenham by helping to regenerate a deprived area blighted by riots, becoming a stadium that is \"a must-see stop on those touring London's architectural splendours\" and one should be a source of pride \"for all in the game\"."]}, {"page": "Stealing from the Saracens", "response": ["Hart wrote that Darke's comparison between Big Ben and a now destroyed minaret of the Great Mosque of Aleppo has no evidence of direct influence and could distract from her argument.

Gordon argued that starting the book with the church of Qalb Loze is inaccurate as the building is Christian and predates Islam, while mosaics, coloured glass and bell towers were in Europe before that religion began. William Whyte, Professor of Social and Architectural History at the University of Oxford, concurred that western Gothic has foreign influence but disagreed that this was mostly Islamic: \"the Islamic world and Western Christendom shared a common debt to Byzantine, Roman, and ancient Greek architecture \u2014 and this, in turn, owed something to the art of Egypt, India, and elsewhere.
