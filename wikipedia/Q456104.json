The ramshackle nature of the United defence showed as Tottenham took an early lead through a glancing header from Roman Pavlyuchenko. However, United soon took the initiative back as Carlos Tevez rattled the bar before forcing Spurs 'keeper Ben Alnwick into a reflex save, while Danny Welbeck was only denied by a last-ditch block from Chris Gunter after dancing past three defenders. The score was turned on its head shortly after the half-hour mark, when the home side hit a two-goal salvo in as many minutes. In the 35th minute, Michael Carrick pulled the ball back to Paul Scholes on the edge of the box from a corner, and the midfielder's shot was deflected off Tom Huddlestone past a flat-footed Ben Alnwick. Then, a minute later, Carrick was the provider for United's second goal as he played Berbatov through the middle and the Bulgarian fired past Alnwick from the edge of the area.
