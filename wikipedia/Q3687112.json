At Glen Helen on lap 3, the Honda of John McGuinness was leading his teammate by 18.5 seconds with Conor Cummins holding third place.  On the same lap while exiting Parliament Square, Ramsey the chain on the 1000\u00a0cc Honda of John McGuinness snapped and he coasted to a halt at Cruickshanks Corner.

At the end of lap 4, Conor Cummins posted his first 130\u00a0mph lap in 17 minutes and 23.02 seconds an average speed of 130.225\u00a0mph.

A crash near the Alexander Road Junction with the Quarterbridge Road for the 1000\u00a0cc Suzuki of the American competitor Mark Miller and he slid downhill with his machine all the way to the Quarterbridge.

This was followed by Ian Hutchinson crashing-out of third place of the Senior TT on the same oil at the Quarterbridge and also losing his lead in the Joey Dunlop TT Championship.

Delighted with his first podium place Gary Johnson said; \"It has been a difficult week for us, but the team pulled together to enable me to pull this result out of the bag.
