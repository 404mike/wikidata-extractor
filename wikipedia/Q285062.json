He is currently a professor of chemistry and director of both the Institute for Materials Research and the Materials Science and Engineering program at Binghamton University, State University of New York. He also serves as director of the Northeastern Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES) of the U.S. Department of Energy at Binghamton. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 alongside Akira Yoshino and John B. Goodenough.Whittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of lithium-ion batteries, which now are used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles. He discovered the intercalation electrodes in the 1970s for the first time and thoroughly described the concept of intercalation reaction for rechargeable batteries in the late of 1970s. He holds the original patents on the concept of the use of intercalation chemistry in high power-density, highly reversible lithium-ion batteries. And he invented the first rechargeable lithium-ion battery, patented in 1977, and assigned to Exxon. His work on lithium-ion batteries laid the foundations for others' later developments. Therefore, he is called the Founding Father of lithium-ion batteries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2019", "response": ["* Chemistry \u2013 John B. Goodenough, M.

Stanley Whittingham, Rachid Yazami and Koichi Mizushima during the 1970s1980s, and then a commercial Li-ion battery was developed by a Sony and Asahi Kasei team led by Yoshio Nishi in 1991. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used for portable electronics and electric vehicles and are growing in popularity for military and aerospace applications.", "Research on rechargeable Li-ion batteries dates to the 1960s; one of the earliest examples is a /Li battery developed by NASA in 1965. The breakthrough that produced the earliest form of the modern Li-ion battery was made by British chemist M. Stanley Whittingham in 1974, who first used titanium disulfide () as a cathode material, which has a layered structure that can take in lithium ions without significant changes to its crystal structure. Exxon tried to commercialize this battery in the late 1970s, but found the synthesis expensive and complex, as  is sensitive to moisture and releases toxic  gas on contact with water. More prohibitively, the batteries were also prone to spontaneously catching fire due to the presence of metallic lithium in the cells."]}]}}
