He was born at Benares, India and died at Hartford Bridge, Hartley Wintney, Hampshire.\nLloyd was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle-order right-handed batsman, and he was tried for matches for Cambridge University in both 1866 and 1868 \u2013 in one of the 1868 games, he played for the MCC against the university side \u2013 but he achieved little and was not awarded a Blue. He continued to play in minor matches after leaving Cambridge and appeared for both the Shropshire and Somerset teams in non-first-class matches, including one game for Somerset in 1879 that is the basis of disputes about the cricket career statistics of W. G. Grace (see Variations in first-class cricket statistics). In one of these minor matches featuring many of the players who were instrumental in the setting up of Somerset County Cricket Club, Lloyd made an unbeaten 100 for the Gentlemen of Somerset against the Gentlemen of Dorset. At his only match for Shropshire, in 1868, he scored a century of 108 runs.On leaving Cambridge, he became a schoolmaster at Marlborough College from 1868 to 1875 and was then the headmaster of a preparatory school, Hartford House School, at Hartley Wintney until his retirement in 1910. He died in 1928 aged 83. A brief obituary in The Times states that he was \"one of the most successful private schoolmasters in the country\" and that he achieved many scholarships at public schools, principally at Marlborough, for his pupils.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Lloyd", "response": ["Edward Lloyd may refer to:", "*Edward Lloyd (MP for Montgomery), Welsh lawyer and politician", "*Edward Lloyd (16th-century MP) (died 1547) for Buckingham", "*Edward Lloyd, 1st Baron Mostyn (1768\u20131854), British politician", "*Edward Lloyd (Colonial Governor of Maryland) (1670\u20131718), Governor of the Maryland Colony, 1709\u20131714", "*Edward Lloyd (Continental Congress) (1744\u20131796), his grandson, Maryland delegate to the Continental Congress", "*Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland) (1779\u20131834), his son, U.S. Congressman and Senator, and Governor of Maryland, 1809\u20131811", "*Edward Lloyd (1798\u20131861), his son, President of the Maryland State Senate, 1852\u201353", "*Edward Lloyd (1825\u20131907), his son, President of the Maryland State Senate 1878 and 1892", "*Edward Lloyd (c.\u20091648\u20131713), ran Lloyd's Coffee House in London, a meeting place for shipowners that spawned Lloyd's of London, Lloyd's Register, and Lloyd's List", "*Edward Lloyd (publisher) (1815\u20131890), British owner of the Daily Chronicle and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper", "*Edward Lloyd (tenor) (1845\u20131927), British oratorio singer", "*Edward Lloyd (cricketer) (1845\u20131928), English schoolmaster and cricketer", "*John Edward Lloyd (1861\u20131947), Welsh historian", "*Edward Lloyd Jones (1874\u20131934), Australian cattle breeder and chairman of David Jones department store"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Sainsbury played alongside his older brother, Francis, for Lansdown Cricket Club from at least 1865. His first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in August 1877, when he played for Somerset, against their Dorset neighbours. He opened the batting for the Somerset team alongside Hamilton Ross. Both had been scoring plenty of runs for Lansdown in club cricket,Roebuck (1991), p. 19. and Sainsbury made 32, a respectable score in the match, which Somerset won by an innings. Only Edward Lloyd scored more, posting an unbeaten 110, one of the earliest centuries scored for a Somerset county side. Sainsbury also opened the bowling during the match, but he claimed only one wicket over the two innings and bowled just 13 of the 104 overs. A few days later he appeared again for the county side, against Clifton, who had the Australian Test cricketer, Billy Midwinter, in their team. Sainsbury scored 96 not out, including a \"resolute\" partnership with Stephen Newton, before rain forced the game to be drawn. Subsequently, he scored 7 and 81 against the Wiltshire Wanderers, and took ten wickets in the match, including six in the first innings. In two further appearances for Somerset in 1877, Sainsbury did not surpass the score he reached against Dorset but claimed two further wickets, both against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire. Sainsbury finished the season top of Somerset's batting averages, having scored 230 runs at an average of 46.00."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edward Lloyd (1868) : E.
