He did not take charge of Colchester until after the final game of the 2015\u201316 season, in which his assistant Steve Ball was named caretaker. The club signed a number of players in preparation for the 2016\u201317 season, including defenders Luke Prosser (who he appointed as captain) and Lewis Kinsella; midfielders Brennan Dickenson, Craig Slater and Doug Loft; and forwards Courtney Senior, Kurtis Guthrie, and Denny Johnstone. However top-scorer George Moncur was sold to Barnsley for \u00a3500,000. In his first match in charge on 6 August, McGreal guided his side to a 1\u20131 opening day draw away to Hartlepool United. He earned his first win on 13 August as his side defeated Cambridge United 2\u20130 at the Colchester Community Stadium. After three wins and one draw in Colchester's opening five league fixtures, McGreal was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for August. After an eleven-game winless run, McGreal's side went undefeated in December, earning ten points from a possible twelve which propelled Colchester up the League Two table away from the relegation zone. In turn, McGreal was shortlisted for the League Two Manager of the Month award for December. He won the award on 6 January 2017, becoming the first Colchester manager to win the award since Paul Lambert in January 2009. Later that month he signed Sean Murray on a free transfer from Swindon Town. The \"U's\" finished the season eighth in the table, one place and one point behind Blackpool in the play-offs, who would go on to achieve promotion. McGreal released eight players, whilst also losing top-scorer Chris Porter, who left on a free transfer to sign with Crewe Alexandra."]}, {"page": "Theo Robinson", "response": ["On 24 August 2020, Robinson rejoined Port Vale on a two-year deal, where he faced competition from Tom Pope, Mark Cullen and Devante Rodney for a place in the starting eleven. He stated that \"when I was here before it wasn\u2019t really a good time personally but now I am here to put things right\". It was reported that Grimsby manager Ian Holloway had tried to sign him but lost out due to his club insisting on a clause to reduce pay if the league was postponed or cancelled again due to a second wave of Coronavirus disease 2019 cases; Vale reportedly had no such clause in their contract offer. On 5 September, he scored on his second debut for the Vale, coming on as a substitute to score a late winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Scunthorpe United in the first round of the EFL Cup, manager John Askey said that \"It's nice when you have someone like Theo who can come on and has goals in him\". Robinson set a personal target of 10 goals for the campaign but said the main aim was promotion. Having started the 2020\u201321 season on the bench, he claimed a place in the starting eleven by mid-October after becoming the club's leading scorer. He soon dropped out of the starting eleven however and was transfer-listed in December. Caretaker-manager Danny Pugh deregistered Robinson from the club's 22-man squad the following month in order to make room for new signing Kurtis Guthrie. He was re-registered at the end of the January transfer window and went on to earn praise for his work-rate from new manager Darrell Clarke but was still transfer-listed in May 2021.
