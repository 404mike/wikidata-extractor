He remained with the club until the outbreak of the Second World War, but never made it to the club's first team. During the war he served with the Royal Engineers and also made appearances as a guest player for Sheffield Wednesday during unofficial wartime competitions. He was later posted to Barton Stacey in Hampshire, where he helped his unit's football team win a major Army Football Association trophy. Upon leaving the army in 1946 he joined Gillingham, who at the time were playing in the Kent League. Gillingham manager Archie Clark also signed four other players who had served with Boswell at Barton Stacey and played alongside him in the unit football team, namely Jackie Briggs, George Forrester, Hughie Russell and Vic Hole."]}]}}
