After early efforts as a composer and novelist, and service in naval intelligence in World War I, he became music critic of The Morning Post from 1925 to 1937, which he combined with teaching singing and working as managing director of the Restaurant Boulestin in London.\nIn 1939 Toye was appointed director of the British Institute of Florence, but the outbreak of World War II forced him to leave Italy in 1940.  During the war, he served as director of the Sociedade Brasileira de Cultura Inglesa, Rio de Janeiro.  Toye returned to the institute in Florence in 1946.  He retired in 1958 but continued to live in Florence for the rest of his life.\nToye published novels, a play, autobiographies, essays and some works of music, but the book generally regarded as his most important was Giuseppe Verdi: His Life and Music, published in 1931, which remained the standard English work on its subject for many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gioachino Rossini", "response": ["The reasons for Rossini's withdrawal from opera have been continually discussed during and since his lifetime. Some have supposed that aged thirty-seven and in variable health, having negotiated a sizeable annuity from the French government, and having written thirty-nine operas, he simply planned to retire and kept to that plan. In a 1934 study of the composer, the critic Francis Toye coined the phrase \"The Great Renunciation\", and called Rossini's retirement a \"phenomenon unique in the history of music and difficult to parallel in the whole history of art\":"]}, {"page": "Don Carlos", "response": ["Following the unsuccessful performance in Naples in 1871, Verdi was persuaded to visit the city for further performances in November / December 1872,Walker 1962, p. 417. and he made two more modifications to the score: (a) a revision of the closing two-thirds of the Philippe-Rodrique duet in Act 2, Scene 2 (to Italian verses, almost certainly by Antonio GhislanzoniPorter 1982, p. 368.), which replaced some of the previously cut material, and (b) the removal of the allegro marziale section of the final Elisabeth-Carlos duet (replaced with an 8-bar patch).Verdi; G\u00fcnther 1986, pp. XX, 263\u2013276 (a), 623 (b). Budden 1981, pp. 28\u201329. Porter 1982, p. 362. These are the only portions of the opera that were composed to an Italian rather than a French text. According to Julian Budden, Verdi \"was to regret both modifications\".Budden 1981, p. 29. Ricordi incorporated the revisions into later prints of the opera without changing the plate numbers. This subsequently confused some authors, e.g. Francis Toye and Ernest Newman, who dated them to 1883.Porter 1982, pp. 362\u2013363."]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9 Messager", "response": ["At the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of Massenet's Gris\u00e9lidis and Charpentier's Louise, and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as Hansel and Gretel and Tosca. But by far the best known of his premieres was Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1902). Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. In gratitude Debussy dedicated the work to Messager. Holoman writes, \"his championing of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande alone would have earned him a place in music history.\"Holoman, p. 330 Debussy regarded Messager as the ideal conductor. Before the premiere he had trusted him to \"make his dream into a reality\"; after it he praised him for knowing \"how to awaken the inner sound world of Pell\u00e9as with tender delicacy\".Orledge, p. 66 After Messager's commitments obliged him to leave Paris for London, Debussy found the performances much less satisfactory.Nichols and Langham-Smith, p. 149 As a conductor, Messager won praise on both sides of the English Channel.\"The Op\u00e9ra Comique\", The Times, 22 November 1901, p. 10; and \"Music in Paris\", The Times, 3 May 1902, p. 8 The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that, good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better.\"The Charm of Music\", The Illustrated London News, 29 July 1939, p. 210 The Parisian critic Pierre Lalo said of Messager:"]}, {"page": "Oberto (opera)", "response": ["Contemporary critical reactions to Verdi's first effort were mixed, as noted by scholar Francis Toye, writing in 1931, when he quoted two Milanese critics:"]}, {"page": "I due Foscari", "response": ["Reaction to the premiere was tempered by several elements outside of Verdi's control, including the recent rise in seat prices by the management and the rather lackluster quality of the performers' voices. But the reception given to the composer by the management was very enthusiastic as was that of some of the press, especially the critic of Rivista di Roma who noted that \"even more than in Ernani, Verdi has endeavoured to shake off his former manner, to return to the springs of passion and affection\".Quoted in Budden, p. 179, but noted that it has been quoted in Francis Toye's Giuseppe Verdi: His Life and Works from 1931."]}]}}
