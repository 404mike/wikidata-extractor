Anthony is introduced as a potential choice for practice manager of the Mill, and he is chosen instead of Mrs Tembe (Lorna Laidlaw), his only other competition for the role. He takes a dislike to Mrs Tembe, and encourages her to work at another practice, which he achieves. When a merger between the Mill and King's Green, another local surgery, is suggested, Anthony is supportive. He calls a meeting between himself and the partners at the Mill; Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers) and Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh), he tries to convince them that the merger would benefit all of them. Daniel is later shocked when he hears Anthony talking about bribery in order to achieve the merger. Daniel and Zara attend a dinner at Anthony's house, where they meet his wife Trish (Kim Tiddy). They bond over their plans for the Mill, but when the pair talk badly about Mrs Tembe, Zara jumps to her defence. Days later, Anthony calls a meeting to finalise the merger of the surgeries. He is excited to reveal his plans of becoming a partner, expecting the other three partners to be supportive, but he is shocked when the three of them vote against the idea.
