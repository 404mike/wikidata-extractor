Centre forward Jackie Brown debuted in January 1947 (in season 1953\u201354 he would score 4 hat tricks). Dougie McBain replaced Fitzsimmons and gave 7 years from 1948. Jim Patterson signed in 1949 (251 strikes for the club make Jim Patterson the all-time goals king of Queen's). Inside forward and play maker Walter Rothera joined the club in 1951 as did full back Jimmy Binning, left half Jimmy Greenock and Jackie Oakes returned this time from Manchester City. Centre-half Alex Smith and goal scoring outside right Bobby Black (another local boy) did the same in 1952. Black is the club's 2nd highest scorer with 120 goals. Charlie Johnstone played until 1953 before retiring aged 41. At different levels whilst at Queen's, Houliston, Sharp, Patterson, Binning and Black would represent Scotland internationally. Henderson was selected 6 times as Scotland reserve goalkeeper. Queen's topped Scotland's highest division until Christmas in season 1953\u201354. Same season league defeats were given again to both of the Old Firm in 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 by killer Queen's. The solidity of Queen's results through this period peaked in 1955\u201356 when after again leading the top division early in the season it finished in sixth place, a finish surpassed only once in the club's history. For Queen's fans this was the time of the beautiful South."]}]}}
