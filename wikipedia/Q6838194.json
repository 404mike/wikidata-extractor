It's never great singing but his deadpan Welsh-American accent gives it just the right edge. His music has broadened its range whilst also sounding more pared-down. And at least five songs on this album stand equal to the best songs of the 70s. I think it's self-evident from Paris and Fear that Cale's work is more original and more enjoyable than the albums being put out by a dozen better-known artists.\""]}, {"page": "Schiele in Prison", "response": ["Schiele in Prison is a 1980 British independent film directed by Mick Gold and starring David Suchet as Gustav Klimt, Grant Cathro as Egon Schiele and Nicholas Selby as The Judge.

The magazine struggled to achieve consistent sales of 20,000 and closed due to market forces.
