G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905), and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became Brave New World. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had \"been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells\", but then he \"got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas.\" Unlike the most popular optimistic utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a \"negative utopia\", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.Lawrence biographer Frances Wilson writes that \"the entire novel is saturated in Lawrence\" and cites \"Lawrence's New Mexico\" in particular. Wilson, Frances (2021).

The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter, which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs. He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["*Frances Wilson"]}, {"page": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "response": ["*Frances Wilson, Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["The longlist of 12 titles was announced on 12 September 2019.

He notes that there are inconsistencies from page to page, concerning details such as the names and backgrounds of Lawrence's characters. In his view, the novel's chapters are \"improvised variations on Lawrence's own experience\", and satirize people Lawrence knew. He sees the character Lilly as Lawrence himself, and Aaron as John Middleton Murry. He believes that the book's theme is Lawrence's gratification of his frustrated longing for an \"utterly obedient and subservient disciple.\" He criticizes the book's early chapters, writing that they have little or nothing of Lawrence's \"personal daimon\", and lack the \"thrilling eloquence and passionate poetry and subtle physical emotion of which he alone had the secret\", while the book as a whole shows \"the satirical Lawrence, not at his best, but almost at the level of spiteful gossip.\" According to Lawrence biographer Frances Wilson, Aldington himself is portrayed in Aaron's Rod: \"Aldington is Robert Cunningham, 'a fresh, stoutish young Englishman in khaki.'\"Wilson, Frances, Burning Man: The Trials of D.H.

They were also tutored for nine months in Lausanne to ensure competency in French. Later, the progressive coeducational boarding school, Bedales, in Sussex, became available for the youngest sister, No\u00ebl. Soon, like minded people started to settle in the neighbourhood. Among the first were the Peases and the Garnetts, Edward and Constance Garnett and their son, David \"Bunny\" Garnett. Others included Octavia Hill, the economist J. A. Hobson, the writers E. V. Lucas and Henry Salt and William and Margaret Pye, whose children included Edith, Ethel, Sybil and David. Ford Madox Ford lived there for a while and Margaret Olivier's sister Agatha and her family also moved to Surrey. Eventually the area became a hub of progressive Fabian intellectuals. There, the four Olivier sisters led a free-spirited outdoor life, disdainful of social convention, which later made them very much aligned to the ethos of Rupert Brooke's Neo-pagans, building tree houses, referring to themselves as the Reivilo tribe, and becoming very athletic in a manner that David Garnett compared to ancient Sparta. He also described them both as \"ruthless Valkyries\" and as \"cruel as savages\". Frances Wilson would later describe them as \"feral\". One woman, hired as a nursemaid to care for the children in 1892 was the future author Gertrude Dix, herself an emancipated woman who described her child rearing philosophy as \"principles of freedom\", allowing children to learn through experience rather than rules. Dix was a New Woman writer, and this philosophy permeated the culture of Limpsfield. Among other early childhood influences, were G. B. Shaw and H. G. Wells."]}, {"page": "The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper", "response": ["Overall, the book was received positively.
