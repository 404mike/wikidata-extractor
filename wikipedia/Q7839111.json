This run was not too damaging however, as eleven of the games were draws. Included in this was a club record streak of six home draws, lasting from 10 October to 27 December. Sproson complained of Mick Cullerton's attitude, and had to endure speculation of former Stoke City manager Tony Waddington taking his job. Sproson was sacked in October, and he rejected the offer of an executive position at the club. Colin Harper was made caretaker-manager. The board tried and failed to attract Bill McGarry to the vacant managerial position, and so advertised the position with a significant salary increase to attract applicants. On 17 November, Bobby Smith was sacked as Bury manager, and the next day walked into the Vale job. He appointed Dennis Butler as his assistant, as Harper left the club. Sproson also returned to Vale with an offer 'to help in any capacity'. Victory finally came on New Year's Eve with a 3\u20130 win over Rotherham United.
