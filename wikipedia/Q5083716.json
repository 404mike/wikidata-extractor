In the late 1960s, he enrolled six of his core musicians including legendary Kenyan musician, Daudi Kabaka, in a two-year course at the Conservatory of Music in Nairobi to learn music notation and theory.  Worrod was never to reap great financial benefits from the recording industry in East Africa, although he went on to be well known in musical circles both locally and abroad.\nWorrod is said to have been influential in the development of the growing popularity of the 'African Twist' and similar music styles developing at the time.  His hand in the music industry both locally and abroad saw him meeting and promoting music legends such as Pat Boone and Roger Whittaker.\nInitially, Roger Whittaker was under contract to Worrod, who allowed him to cancel it to pursue a more lucrative career path with EMI.\nWorrod is credited with recording songs of international status, such as Malaika (Fadhili William), Helule Helule (which later caught the interest of the British pop band, The Tremeloes), and the Kenyan-nationalised anthem-like Harambee.\nDuring his time promoting and recording Kenyan music, Worrod instituted the concept of royalties in Kenya for musical artists.\nHe died in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa on 6 June 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malaika", "response": ["Authorship of this popular song is still very controversial. However, most people accredit its authorship to Adam Salim, a not-well-published Tanzanian songwriter. Salim (born in 1916) composed this song while he was living in Nairobi between 1945\u201346. According to this story, Adam Salim composed \"Malaika\" song in 1945 for his very beautiful girlfriend Halima Ramadhani Maruwa. Their parents disapproved of their relationship, and Halima was forced by her parents to marry an Asian tajir (wealthy man). Fadhili William, a Kenyan singer, is also associated with the song because he is the first person to record it. Producer Charles Worrod provides yet another version, crediting the song to Grant Charo, William's brother-in-law (see Ondevo 2006), a claim which is also associated with the fact that Fadhili William was the first person to record the song. Charo is not known to have confirmed this claim.", "It was later re-recorded at Equator Sound Studios by the British-born Kenyan music promoter Charles Worrod, who marketed the ballad to eventually becoming an internationally acclaimed song."]}, {"page": "Equator Records", "response": ["Equator Records or Equator Sound Studios was originally known as East African Records, owned by Afcot Ltd, situated in Nairobi, Kenya.
