Based on traditional timber frame methods modified to use standard modern materials, his method eliminates the need for wet trades such as bricklaying and plastering, resulting in a light-weight method which can be built with minimal experience and is ecologically sound. The roofs tend to be flat with many layers of roofing felt, which allows the creation of grass-covered roofs. Foundations are minimal, often just paving slabs, the strength coming from the geometry of their construction. Segal houses have been compared to traditional Japanese houses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Ward", "response": ["Most of Ward's works deal with the issue of rural housing and the problems of overpopulation and planning regulations in Britain to which he proposed anarchistic solutions. He was a keen admirer of architect Walter Segal who set up a 'build it yourself' system in Lewisham meaning that land that was too small or difficult to build on conventionally was given to people who with Segal's help would build their own homes. Ward was very keen on the idea of 'build it yourself' having said in response to the proposition of removing all planning laws, 'I don't believe in just letting it rip, the rich get away with murder when that happens. But I do want the planning system to be flexible enough to give homeless people a chance'. In his book Cotters and Squatters, Ward described the historical development of informal customs to appropriate land for housing which frequently grew up in opposition to legally constituted systems of land ownership. Ward described folkways in many cultures which parallel the Welsh tradition of the T\u0177 unnos or 'one night house' erected on common land."]}, {"page": "1907 in architecture", "response": ["* Walter Segal, German-born architect, pioneer of self-build methods (died 1985)"]}, {"page": "Horniman Museum", "response": ["The Horniman Museum contains the CUE (Centre for Understanding the Environment) building.

Timber framing is also rare in the city, but modern self-build schemes at Sea Saw Way, Whitehawk (1993) and Hogs Edge, Bevendean (1997\u20132000) feature this structural system.  The latter development was built according to Walter Segal's self-build methods and has sustainable features including recycled paper insulation.  Waste House, a conceptual sustainable building within the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts campus in central Brighton, was built between 2012 and 2014.  Nearly 90% of its materials\u2014from the timber-framed structure (made of reclaimed wood from building sites) and exterior walls formed of waste chalk and clay to the household-rubbish insulation (VHS cassettes, toothbrushes and denim offcuts)\u2014were destined for landfill.
