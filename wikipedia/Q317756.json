His appearance in the starting 11 for Everton was threatened by the arrival of South African loan-signing Steven Pienaar. Osman scored his first goal in a UEFA competition on 25 October 2007, Everton's second in a 3\u20131 UEFA Cup group stage win over Greek club Larissa at Goodison Park. His shot from 22 yards helped Everton to the top of the group and was voted Everton's Goal of the Season. Osman scored both goals in Everton's 2\u20130 win over Fulham on the final day of the season to secure Everton 5th place in the Premier League for 2008\u201309.

Following the match, his role as captain was praised by manager Alan Pardew, who wanted him to captain another match. On 12 January 2014, and with Newcastle trailing 1\u20130 at home to Manchester City, Tiot\u00e9 had a goal controversially disallowed, when referee Mike Jones ruled that Yoan Gouffran had blocked the goalkeeper's view from an offside position, and pundits criticised the decision to disallow the goal. Later that month, Cabaye left the club to join Paris Saint-Germain, thus disrupting the successful partnership between the two men. As a result, his form suffered, with replacement Dan Gosling not up to the preferred standard. However, Tiot\u00e9 was given the captain's armband in the absence of Coloccini, who had suffered a knee injury against West Bromwich Albion.

Hughton received praise for his calm management style to stabilise the club, shrewd signings and guiding Newcastle back to the Premier League. Prior to Newcastle's 1\u20131 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and away win at Everton, he completed the signings of Cheick Tiot\u00e9 and Hatem Ben Arfa. Despite leading his newly promoted side to healthy ninth place by the end of October, unrest came when star player Andy Carroll was arrested for assault. Newcastle followed this with wins at West Ham United and a memorable 5\u20131 derby victory against Sunderland. Both before and after the victory Hughton received the backing of his players and the Newcastle supporters.

This was generally the only UK match shown live on television every season. Both broadcasters started coverage from early morning trying to gain the upper hand on their rival. ITV regained the live rights to broadcast the FA Cup exclusively on terrestrial television in 1997, showing each final with Sky from 1998 to 2001 while the BBC screened highlights on Match of the Day. The FA Cup then reverted to the BBC until 2008 when ITV regained the FA Cup and England rights. However, their coverage of the competition was criticised after a string of errors including poor camera angles, very short highlight shows and, most notably, the incident during the Fourth Round derby between Everton and Liverpool in the 2008\u201309 competition. After a goalless 90 minutes, the game went to extra-time. And when young midfielder Dan Gosling scored the winner in the second half of extra-time, ITV accidentally cut to adverts, causing viewers to miss the goal. Eventually, ITV lost these rights from the end of the 2013\u201314 season to BBC Sport.

Both teams enjoyed strong campaigns in the Premier League, as Liverpool challenged for the title and Everton qualified for Europe finishing in fifth place and 9 points adrift of the Champions League places.
