He was born in Small Heath, Birmingham, but no place of death is recorded on the main cricket websites.\nCarter was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler who began as a fast-medium opening bowler but who later developed a second style, bowling off-breaks. As a multi-purpose bowler, he had two good seasons with the Warwickshire first eleven in 1957 and 1958.Carter first appeared in first-class cricket in non-County Championship matches in Warwickshire's Championship-winning season of 1951 and playing as a fast-medium opening bowler; he took four for 64 in the first innings of his first game, against Scotland. From 1952, he was on National Service and when he returned to Warwickshire in 1955, he faced competition for a fast-bowling place from other young bowlers, including Roly Thompson, Jack Bannister and Keith Dollery. He remained an irregular first-team player until the 1957 season, when his versatility won him a fairly regular place in the team, playing 23 matches, the most he managed in any single season. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's obituary of Carter in its 2013 edition testified to the usefulness of his different bowling styles: he \"took five for 56 against Nottinghamshire with his quicker stuff, then seven for 57 with off-cutters a fortnight later to set up victory over Gloucestershire at Bristol\". In 1957, he took 70 wickets at the somewhat high (for the time) average of 29.15; in the wet summer of 1958, he did even better from 21 matches, taking 81 wickets at 20.01. The 1958 figures included his single most successful match, the game against Somerset in which he took six for 54 in the first innings and eight for 82 in the second; the second-innings analysis was the best of his career and the 14 wickets for 136 in the match were the only time in his first-class career that he took 10 wickets or more in a game. He was awarded his county cap for his bowling in 1958.From 1959, however, Carter was beset by both injury and loss of form: his wickets were few in number and expensive in both the 1959 and 1961 seasons, and he was injured for much of the 1960 season with a chronic back condition. In the less than exacting context of a game against Cambridge University in 1961, he batted at No 11 and scored 37 in a last-wicket partnership with Gordon Marshall, and this was his highest first-class score. But it was the penultimate match of his first-class career and he left the Warwickshire staff at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in November 2012", "response": ["*Ray Carter, 79, English cricketer."]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ray Carter (1951\u20131961) : R.

His greatest success came in his second match of the 1961 season. Against Cambridge University, he scored an unbeaten 18 and put on 58 for the 10th wicket with Ray Carter, whose 37 was the highest of his own career; Marshall then took five wickets for just 22 runs in 20 overs in the Cambridge first innings. He achieved very little in his other games and was not given an opportunity in a County Championship match."]}, {"page": "Shirley Griffiths", "response": ["Griffiths was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. After a few games in 1956, he played in about a third of Warwickshire's matches in 1957 and a similar number in 1958, but faced a lot of competition for a fast bowling place from Jack Bannister, Roly Thompson and Ray Carter. His best performances came in 1958, the best of all being seven Kent wickets for 62 runs at Edgbaston in mid-June. In early July, he took five for 37 as Middlesex were dismissed for just 77, but in a soggy summer this did not produce a victory. But when the Cambridge University bowler Ossie Wheatley was available later in the same month, it was Griffiths who made way for him and he was unable to regain his place. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack recorded that \"Griffiths, the fastest bowler, was also the most erratic and faded from the scene.\" He was not re-engaged for the 1959 season and did not play first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "Raymond Carter (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECTRay Carter (cricketer)"]}]}}
