A harshly cold winter known as the \"Big Freeze\" savaged the footballing season and Vale went from 22 December to 2 March without fulfilling a league fixture; however this aided Grainger as he was able to rest and heal his groin problem rather than rely on cortisone injections to mask the pain. He was however in conflict with new manager Freddie Steele, who told him the pain in his groin was just psychological. The Big Freeze's resulting fixture congestion was too much for Grainger to cope with and he again injured his groin in a 2\u20131 defeat to Barnsley on 29 March and could only feature in three of the club's final fifteen games as Vale went on to finish in third-place, four points shy of a promotion spot."]}, {"page": "Norman Low", "response": ["He added to his squad for the 1961\u201362 campaign by spending \u00a32,000 on inside-forward Arthur Longbottom (Queens Park Rangers); \u00a310,000 on Stan Steele (back from West Brom); and \u00a32,000 on centre-half John Nicholson (Liverpool); whilst free signings included winger Stan Edwards (Everton), goalkeeper Peter Taylor (Middlesbrough), and Joe Maloney (Shrewsbury Town). He sold Cliff Portwood to Grimsby Town for \u00a36,000 to balance the books. The Sentinel commented that \"gloom has descended\" following a poor start to the season, however the Vale's form improved after Low sold Dennis Fidler to Grimsby Town for \u00a32,000, signed Colin Grainger from Leeds United for \u00a36,000, and further added to his firepower by signing Ralph Hunt from Swindon Town for \u00a33,500. Stanley Matthews' return to the Victoria Ground resulted in Low unsuccessfully trying to tempt Tom Finney out of retirement.

Free signings included winger Stan Edwards (Everton), goalkeeper Peter Taylor (Middlesbrough), and Joe Maloney (Shrewsbury Town).
