He played 148 league games in a six-year career in the Football League.\nA defender, he began his career with Nottingham Forest. He did not play a first team game for Forest, and so was sold on to Port Vale in November 1974 for a \u00a35,000 fee. He spent four years with the Vale, before he was moved on to Crewe Alexandra in December 1978. He transferred to non-league side Northwich Victoria in 1980, and later played for Stafford Rangers, Boston United, and Eastwood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["For the 1974\u201375 season he signed midfielders Terry Bailey and Frank Sharp, defender Garry Dulson, and goalkeeper John Connaughton. The club finished in sixth place, just four points short of promotion. However, due to the club's precarious financial situation a total of thirteen players were released. He made ambition plans for the 1975\u201376 season, though he failed to land Wales internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies. Instead he signed striker Mick Cullerton from Stafford Rangers for \u00a34,000, and midfielders Terry Lees (a \u00a33,000 signing from Stoke City) and Geoff Morris (a \u00a3200 signing from Bangor City). Cullerton hit 21 goals, but Vale could not repeat their efforts of the previous season and had to make do with a twelfth-place finish."]}, {"page": "David Harris (footballer, born 1953)", "response": ["He then fell out of favour, though he was once again a first team regular by March 1975.

In September, Sproson made a \u00a310,000 bid for Keith Leonard that was rejected. Instead he brought in young left-back Garry Dulson on loan from Nottingham Forest, and later bought him permanently for \u00a35,000, using another \u00a35,400 Villa were forced to pay Vale after Morgan hit another target. The \"Valiants\" proved difficult to beat, and heading into Christmas they won six of their last nine league games. Their 4\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town lifted them into third place, though attendances were still below 4,000. A 3\u20131 win over Southend United at Roots Hall then put the club into second spot, at which point Bob Mountford was sold to Rochdale for \u00a32,000. A four-day holiday in Benidorm in the new year did not seem to help the Vale, as three straight defeats followed to drag them down the table. To halt the slide Sproson bought striker Derek Brownbill from Liverpool for \u00a35,000. Two sendings off in a 3\u20131 defeat at Leeds Road \u2013 John Brodie also managed to break his leg in the challenge that earned him a red card \u2013 forced Sproson to defend his team after that took the Vale's red card tally to seven for the season.
