Bury paid Winsford \u00a36,000 and would later pay another \u00a325,000 after he was sold on. However, he never played for Connor as he was replaced by Jim Iley before the start of the 1980\u201381 season; despite this managerial change he was still seen as the future replacement to club stalwart John Forrest. He received specialist goalkeeping coaching from Wilf McGuinness. He made his first team debut against Wigan Athletic on 20 September, in a 2\u20131 victory. The \"Shakers\" had an indifferent league campaign in the Fourth Division, though they managed to reach the Third Round of the FA Cup and beat Newcastle United in the League Cup. Southall kept 15 clean sheets after conceding 50 goals in his 44 domestic appearances, and was named as Bury's Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year."]}]}}
