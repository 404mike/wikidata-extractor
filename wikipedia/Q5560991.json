He was a significant influence on the British foreign policy in the Far East in the early 20th century. He also published a number of novels and other works under the pseudonym John Paris.\nAshton-Gwatkin was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford.In 1915 he married Nancy Violet Butler (d. 1953), of Melbourne, Australia.After several years in the Consular Service in East Asia, where he acquired a good knowledge of Japanese, Ashton-Gwatkin joined the Far Eastern Department of the Foreign Office in 1919, transferring to the Diplomatic Service in 1921. In 1929, he was sent to the Soviet Union to work at the British Embassy in Moscow, but returned after a year to be secretary of the Anglo-Soviet Debt Committee under Lord Goschen.He participated in several international conferences, including the Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa in 1932 and the World Economic Conference in London the following year. As a result of his interest in economic affairs, he was instrumental in establishing the Economic Relations Section in the Foreign Office, focused on co-ordinating British diplomatic and economic policies, becoming its first head in 1934. In the late summer of 1938, he served as Chief of Staff on the Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia and was a member of the British delegation at the subsequent Munich Conference.During the 1930s, Ashton-Gwatkin was a staunch advocate of the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany. Although he later revised his views, Ashton-Gwatkin\u2019s political outlook at that time is encapsulated by his expressed hope - in the immediate aftermath of the Munich Agreement in 1938 - of \u201can Anglo-German policy of economic co-operation\u201d flourishing within a German-dominated East Central Europe.Ashton-Gwatkin\u2019s literary work, published under the name of John Paris, reflected his period of residence in Japan and included the novels Kimono (1921), Sayonara (1924), Banzai! (1925),The Island beyond Japan (1929), Matsu (1932) and a collection of verses A Japanese Don Juan and other Poems (1926). The novels were noted for their realistic portrayal of life in East Asia. Previously, whilst an undergraduate at Oxford, he was awarded the 1909 Newdigate Prize for a poem entitled Michelangelo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1909 in literature", "response": ["*Newdigate Prize: Frank Ashton-Gwatkin"]}, {"page": "Newdigate Prize", "response": ["* 1909: Michelangelo.

Goerdeler asked Frank Ashton-Gwatkin of the Foreign Office to ensure that Britain gave a post-Nazi government an interest-free loan of \u00a3500 million in exchange for which Goerdeler would end protectionism, end the efforts to place the Balkans into the German sphere of influence and support Britain in the Mediterranean against Italy and in the Far East against Japan.Watt, D.C. How War Came, Pantheon Books: New York, 1989 page 104. In addition, both Goerdeler's exaggeration of extent of anti-Nazi feeling in Germany and his inability to organise a putsch were increasingly clear to the British.Weinberg, page 525. Sir Alexander Cadogan wrote about Goerdeler's offer, \"We are to deliver the goods and Germany gives I.O.Us\".

Young: \"Economic and financial situation gravely critical. Inner situation desperate. Economic conditions getting worse\". In February 1939, Goerdeler's assessment of the German economic situation was contradicted by Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, the Foreign Office's economic expert, who reported to the Cabinet after he visited Germany that through Germany suffered from serious economic problems, the situation was nowhere near as desperate as portrayed by Goerdeler in the \"X documents\".Overy, pages 107\u2013108 As the British historian Richard Overy observed, Chamberlain much preferred Goerdeler's assessment of German economic problems over Ashton-Gwatkin's, whose views were ignored by Chamberlain in 1939.Overy, p. 108 The accuracy of Goerdeler's information has been the subject of much historical debate, with some historians arguing that Goerdeler exaggerated the extent of German economic problems, but other historians have maintained that Goerdeler's information was correct and that Soviet economic support, together with plundering occupied countries, saved the German economy from collapse in 1939 to 1941."]}, {"page": "Runciman Report (1938)", "response": ["Evidence suggests that a section of the report was redrafted at a late stage, probably by Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, the Chief of Staff of the Mission and a permanent official in the British Foreign Office, in order to bring the recommendations fully into line with British policy.Bruegel, J.W Czechoslovakia Before Munich: The German Minority Problem and British Appeasement Policy, Cambridge, 1973, pp. 275\u2013276.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul: The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, Hampshire, 2003, , pp. 344\u2013349."]}, {"page": "Frank Ashton Gwatkin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Ashton-Gwatkin"]}, {"page": "Runciman Mission", "response": ["Lord Runciman and his small teamIn addition to Runciman himself and Ashton-Gwatkin (a Foreign Office official), who acted as chief-of-staff, the Mission comprised, Robert Stopford (a banker with experience of international financial negotiations), Ian Henderson (a former British Consul at Innsbruck), Geoffrey Peto (a former Conservative Member of Parliament and parliamentary aid to Runciman), David Stephens (a parliamentary official), with secretarial provision by Rosemary Miller and Aline Tillard.
