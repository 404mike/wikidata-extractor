His work could be defined as sculpture or installation and is characterised by risk taking and purposelessness in tightly and often precariously balanced juxtapositions of objects.  In February 2011 Matt Calderwood was commissioned by the music group The Streets to make a video work as part of their musical 'takeover' of The Guardian's website.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Decima Gallery", "response": ["*1998: March: 290\u00bc pounds - the first solo exhibition of Matt Calderwood.
