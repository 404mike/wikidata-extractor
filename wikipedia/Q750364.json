He then worked as the Public Affairs Officer at the Commission for Racial Equality (Scotland).\nJoyce was first elected to the British House of Commons in the 2000 Falkirk West by-election. From 2003, Joyce served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to several UK government ministers.

He served as Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland under Ed Miliband from June to November 2010.\nJoyce was arrested five times during his last five years as an MP, mostly for assault. This led to his suspension from the Labour Party, before pleading guilty to all charges and resigning from the party the following month. He continued representing his constituency as an independent until retiring at the 2015 general election. In August 2020, Joyce was sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to making an indecent image of a child.
