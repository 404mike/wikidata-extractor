Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6\u20130 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead early in the second half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone for the first time in 2015\u201316. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at the end of last season, was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5\u20131 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the bottom corner on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.", "|Jordan Lussey", "!scope=row|Jordan Lussey * "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 12 July 2015 || CM ||  || Jordan Lussey || Liverpool || Free transfer || ", "| 26 November 2015 ||MF ||  || Jordan Lussey || York City || 26 December 2015 || "]}, {"page": "Lussey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jordan Lussey"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2016 || CM ||  || Jordan Lussey || Southport || Released || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| July 2017 || CM ||  || Jordan Lussey ||  Southport || No || "]}, {"page": "Ryan Giles", "response": ["On 24 March 2018 he was loaned to his hometown club AFC Telford United in the National League North for the rest of the season, being signed by his future Wolves under-23 coach Rob Edwards.
