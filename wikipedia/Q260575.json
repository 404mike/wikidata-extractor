Bailey was born as Alice La Trobe-Bateman, in Manchester, England. She moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.\nBailey's works, written between 1919 and 1949, describe a wide-ranging neo-Theosophical system of esoteric thought covering such topics as how spirituality relates to the Solar System, meditation, healing, spiritual psychology, the destiny of nations, and prescriptions for society in general. She described the majority of her work as having been telepathically dictated to her by a Master of Wisdom, initially referred to only as \"the Tibetan\" or by the initials \"D.K.\", later identified as Djwal Khul. Her writings bore some similarity to those of Madame Blavatsky and are among  the teachings often referred to as the \"Ageless Wisdom\". Though Bailey's writings differ in some respects to the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky, they have much in common with it. She wrote on religious themes, including Christianity, though her writings are fundamentally different from many aspects of Christianity or other orthodox religions. Her vision of a unified society included a global \"spirit of religion\" different from traditional religious forms and including the concept of the Age of Aquarius.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Alice Bailey"]}, {"page": "Millennialism", "response": ["The Theosophist Alice Bailey taught that Christ (in her books she refers to the powerful spiritual being best known by Theosophists as Maitreya as The Christ or The World Teacher, not as Maitreya) would return \u201csometime after AD 2025\u201d, and that this would be the New Age equivalent of the Christian concept of the Second Coming of Christ.Bailey, Alice A.

It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a \"new order of ages\", while in the 1980s the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that \"all mankind is entering a new age\". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.  In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published The New Age and its Message, while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled The New Age. The concept of a coming \"new age\" that would be inaugurated by the return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole (1884-1968) and of Johanna Brandt (1876-1964), and then also appeared in the work of the British-born American Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880-1949), featuring prominently in such titles as Discipleship in the New Age (1944) and Education in the New Age (1954).  Carl Jung frequently wrote of the \u201cnew aeon/aion,\u201d denoting the shift from the \u201cPlatonic month\u201d of Pisces to that of Aquarius."]}, {"page": "Violet (color)", "response": ["*The \"New Age Prophetess\", Alice Bailey, in her system called the Seven Rays which classifies humans into seven different metaphysical psychological types, the \"seventh ray\" of \"Ceremonial Order\" is represented by the color violet.
