The band was founded as a side project of the band Public Disturbance, and was part of the Cardiff music scene.", "The band formed in 1997 in Pontypridd, Wales. Lostprophets formed by Ian Watkins and Lee Gaze after their previous band Fleshbind disbanded. They could not find a singer so Watkins decided he would switch from drums to be the frontman and they recruited Mike Chiplin on drums. Mike Lewis (who was also in Public Disturbance) joined a few months later after the original bassist left. Watkins and Lewis were also members of Public Disturbance. Neither member initially left Public Disturbance, although Watkins left as soon as 1998. With Watkins on vocal duties and Lewis (who did not leave Public Disturbance until 2000) playing bass, the band also included guitarist Lee Gaze and Mike Chiplin on drums.", "The album was released in the UK on 2 February 2004, and was commercially successful, achieving number four in the UK Albums Chart and selling over 415,000 copies.
