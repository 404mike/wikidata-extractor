In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two.  Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches.  In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones.  Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain.  In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season.  Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season.Foot (1986), pp155\u2013156. The next three captains \u2013 Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff \u2013 all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\"Foot (1986), p169. This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain."]}, {"page": "Oliver Hutton", "response": ["Hutton was born in Johannesburg, South Africa.
