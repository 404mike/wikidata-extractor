The \"Welcome the Rolling Stones, Good Guys\" sweatshirt worn by the \"little girl\" figure on the far right of the photo (actually a cloth figure of Shirley Temple) was provided by Cooper's young son Adam, the product of his marriage to Rose, his muse and model. Cooper also created the cover lenticular for the Rolling Stones 1967 LP Their Satanic Majesties Request.\nIn 1964 Cooper met London art dealer Robert Fraser, through whom he was introduced to leading figures in music, art and literature, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones (the rock band he worked most closely with), Marianne Faithfull, Eric Clapton, artists Cecil Beaton, Andy Warhol, Jann Haworth, Stephen Shore, Peter Blake and David Hockney and writers William S. Burroughs, Jean Genet, Terry Southern and Allen Ginsberg.Cooper was one of those present at Keith Richards' house, \"Redlands\", in Sussex, when a party being held there was raided by police in the late afternoon of 12 February 1967, leading to drugs charges being laid against Richards, Mick Jagger and Robert Fraser.\n\nCooper loaned Terry Southern a copy of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange in 1967 and they collaborated on the first film adaptation of the novel, which Cooper intended to direct, with Mick Jagger as Alex and the other members of The Rolling Stones as Alex's gang of droogs. The project was eventually shelved after the screenplay was returned (unread) by Britain's Lord Chamberlain, with a note indicating that he would not allow the film to be made because it dealt with \"youthful incitement\". Southern later recommended the book to his friend Stanley Kubrick after Kubrick's planned film on Napoleon was rejected by MGM.Cooper committed suicide 1973, caught in a spiral of depression and heroin addiction. He was 31. In a suicide note addressed to his son, Adam, Cooper wrote:\n\nDon't believe the court when they say that I killed myself when the balance of my mind was disturbed. I just live in a disturbed world, and, as the old poem says, \"I hear the sound of a different drum.\"... I come from what your generation will call the 'Half and Halves'. A generation that made a few changes, but had to experience too many other kinds of changes they had no control over, so some of us were bound to fall by the wayside. I'm one of those.\nA lavish book of Cooper's photographs, Blinds and Shutters, edited by Brian Roylance, was published in a limited edition in 1990 by Genesis Publications. A retrospective exhibition of his photography with the same title was held at the Atlas Gallery, London in September\u2013October 2003.  Cooper's photographs also feature in the book Michael Cooper: You Are Here \u2013 The London Sixties, edited by Robin Muir, and in the book The Early Stones, edited by Perry Richardson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Rolling Stones", "response": ["The band released Their Satanic Majesties Request, which reached No.\u00a03 in the UK and No.\u00a02 in the US, in December 1967. It drew unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties was recorded while Jagger, Richards and Jones were awaiting their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was publicly amicable, but in 2003 Jagger said: \"The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really\u2014and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job.\" Satanic Majesties became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. Its psychedelic sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by Michael Cooper, who had also photographed the cover of Sgt. Pepper.

The cover was art-directed by Robert Fraser and photographed by Michael Cooper.", "The 30 March 1967 photo session with Cooper also produced the back cover and the inside gatefold, which Inglis describes as conveying \"an obvious and immediate warmth\u00a0... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images\". McCartney recalled the inner-gatefold image as an example of the Beatles' interest in \"eye messages\", adding: \"So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this!'... [And] if you look at it you'll see the big effort from the eyes.\" In Lennon's description, Cooper's photos of the band showed \"two people who are flying [on drugs], and two who aren't\"."]}, {"page": "David Hemmings", "response": ["Around 1967, Hemmings was briefly considered for the role of Alex in a planned film version of Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange (1962), which was to be based on a screen treatment by satirist Terry Southern and British photographer Michael Cooper.

On his return to London he continued work on the Casino Royale screenplay and a screen adaptation of The Magic Christian for Peter Sellers, who was planning his film version. Sandy Lieberson optioned Southern's first novel Flash and Filigree and United Artists optioned Candy. Michael Cooper also introduced Southern to the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, and Southern later encouraged Stanley Kubrick to make his film version of the book after MGM refused to back Kubrick's planned film on Napoleon. Southern and Cooper then began to plan their own film adaptation of the novel, to star Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones as Alex and his gang of droogs.", "In summer 1968, he was approached by Esquire magazine to cover the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Southern attended the event with William S. Burroughs, Jean Genet (a last-minute substitute for Samuel Beckett) and John Sack, and his friend Michael Cooper took photographs; Southern and friends were present when peaceful demonstrations erupted into savage violence after protesters were attacked by police.

The band produced the album themselves as their manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham had departed. The prolonged recording process was marked by drug use, court appearances, and jail terms by members of the band. The original LP cover features a lenticular image by photographer Michael Cooper.", "One proposed cover, a photograph of Jagger naked on a cross, was scrapped by the record company for being \"in bad taste\". Initial LP of the album featured a three-dimensional picture of the band on the cover by photographer Michael Cooper. When viewed in a certain way, the lenticular image shows the band members' faces turning towards each other with the exception of Jagger, whose hands appear crossed in front of him. Looking closely on its cover, one can see the faces of each of the four Beatles, reportedly a response to the Beatles' inclusion of a Shirley Temple doll wearing a \"Welcome the Rolling Stones\" sweater on the cover of Sgt. Pepper. Later editions replaced the glued-on three-dimensional image with a photograph, due to high production costs. A limited edition LP version in the 1980s reprinted the original 3D cover design; immediately following the reissue, it was claimed that the master materials for reprinting the 3D cover were intentionally destroyed, implying that faithful recreations of the cover would no longer be possible, but this has since been proven false by numerous re-issues. The 3D album cover was featured, although shrunk down, for the Japanese SHM-CD release in 2010.", "The entire cover design is elaborate, with a dense photo collage filling most of the inside cover (along with a maze) designed by Michael Cooper, and a painting by Tony Meeuwissen on the back cover depicting the four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, and Air).  In some editions the blue-and-white wisps on the front cover are used in a red-and-white version on the paper inner sleeve.  The inner-cover collage has dozens of images, taken from reproductions of old master paintings (Ingres, Poussin, da Vinci, among others), Indian mandalas and portraits, astronomy (including a large image of the planet Saturn), flowers, world maps, etc.  The maze on the inside cover of the UK and US releases cannot be completed: a wall at about a half radius in from the lower left corner means one can never arrive at the goal labeled \"It's Here\" in the centre of the maze."]}, {"page": "Robert Fraser (art dealer)", "response": ["Fraser became a trendsetter during the Sixties; Paul McCartney has described him as \"one of the most influential people of the London Sixties scene\".

After the disastrous events of the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, in which a fan brandishing a handgun was killed by Hells Angels, Jagger began to distance himself from Anger. Instead, he offered his brother Chris Jagger for the role of Lucifer, which Anger accepted. The director Donald Cammell was cast in the role of the god Osiris. Anger cast British singer Marianne Faithfull in the role of the goddess Lilith, while her brother Chris was hired as photographer, and the Rolling Stones' personal photographer, Michael Cooper, was also hired to help with the photography.

He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret.

Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open G tuning played both open and with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set.
