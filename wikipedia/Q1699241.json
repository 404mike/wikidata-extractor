He completed his technical education at Freiberg University of Mining and Technology and got a Doctor's degree from the University of Zurich. Ball traveled to the Saharan Desert in 1897. During his life, he explored and surveyed the deserts of Egypt and Sudan, up until his death in 1941 in Port Said.Ball surveyed the Qattara Depression in Egypt, which lies below sea level, and made the first study of the possibility that this depression could be used for hydroelectric power generation. This concept, the Quattara Depression Project, is unusual in that salt water would be flowing from the Mediterranean Sea into the Qattara Depression, forming an artificial lake below sea level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Qattara Depression", "response": ["The elevation of the depression was first measured in 1917 by an officer of the British Army leading a light car patrol into the region. The officer took readings of the height of the terrain with an aneroid barometer on behalf of John Ball, who later would also publish on the region. He discovered that the spring Ain EI Qattara lay about  below sea level. Because the barometer got lost and the readings were so unexpected, this find had to be verified. During 1924\u201325, Ball again organised a survey party, this time with the sole purpose to triangulate the elevation on a westerly line from Wadi El Natrun. The survey was led by G.F. Walpole who had already distinguished himself by triangulating the terrain across  from the Nile to Siwa via Bahariya. He confirmed the earlier readings and proved the presence of a huge area below sea level, with places as deep as  below sea level.", "Plans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity date back to 1912  from Berlin geographer Albrecht Penck.Murakami M.
