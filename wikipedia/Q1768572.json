However, he was dropped from the side after four matches in favour of Mel Rees and, despite making four further appearances, he was released by the club in December 1985 after the club signed Lee Smelt. He joined Haverfordwest County, also gaining employment as a computer programmer, but a number of injuries to Cardiff's goalkeepers saw the club re-sign Sander on non-contract terms. He played in five matches, including becoming the first Cardiff goalkeeper to save two penalties in the same match during a 1\u20131 draw with Walsall in April 1986, before being released for a second time as the club suffered relegation. He later spent more than four seasons with Barry Town, making over 100 appearances, before playing for Aberystwyth Town."]}]}}
