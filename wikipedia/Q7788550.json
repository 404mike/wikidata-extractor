The building is shown in a plan drawn in 1750, but published in 1770, and referred to as the Main Guard Room. On a 1753 plan of the Parade, it was labelled as the Main Guard. Its location near the King's Bastion meant that it sustained extensive damage during the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779\u20131783). The second storey present today was likely added when the guardhouse was rebuilt. In an 1830s image of Commercial Square, another previous name for John Mackintosh Square, the building is shown with two storeys. The 1830s painting (pictured above) by British artist Thomas Colman Dibdin (1810\u00a0\u2013 1893) shows the Main Guard with officers stationed outside, as well as the nearby Exchange and Commercial Library on the eastern side of the square. Every evening, the sentries in Gibraltar would receive their assignments at the Main Guard. Early 19th-century regulations in Gibraltar required that any inhabitant wandering in the streets after midnight without a permit was to be transferred to the Main Guard. In addition, any inebriated soldier in the city was to be sent to that same guardhouse."]}]}}
