In 1827 he graduated from the University of Edinburgh, and subsequently became an eye surgeon at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital.He was elected assistant-surgeon in 1832 and full surgeon in 1843.  In 1850 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1851 a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.Dalrymple is remembered for his histological work done with Henry Bence Jones (1814-1873) in the discovery of the albumin that was to become known as Bence Jones protein. This protein is often found in the blood and urine of patients with multiple myeloma. He published his findings in a treatise called On the microscopic character of mollities ossium.\nDalrymple also composed two important books on ophthalmology called \"The anatomy of the human eye\" (1834) and \"Pathology of the human eye\" (1852). The eponymous Dalrymple's sign is named after him, which is an abnormal wideness of the palpebral fissures in exophthalmic goiter.\nHe died on the 2nd May 1852 and was buried with his father William on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moorfields Eye Hospital", "response": ["* John Dalrymple (1803\u20131852), English ophthalmologist"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Dalrymple disease \u2013 John Dalrymple"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous medical signs", "response": ["|Dalrymple sign   || John Dalrymple  ||ophthalmology, endocrinology   ||thyrotoxicosis   || ||widened palpebral opening"]}, {"page": "John Dalrymple", "response": ["John Dalrymple may refer to:", "*John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair (1648\u20131707), Scottish noble", "*John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1673\u20131747), Scottish soldier and diplomat", "*John Dalrymple, 5th Earl of Stair (1720\u20131789)", "*John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair (1749\u20131821)", "*John Dalrymple, 7th Earl of Stair (1784\u20131840)", "*John Dalrymple, 8th Earl of Stair (1771\u20131853), British soldier and politician", "*John Dalrymple, 10th Earl of Stair (1819\u20131903), Scottish peer and politician", "*John Dalrymple, 11th Earl of Stair (1848\u20131914), British army officer and nobleman", "*John Dalrymple, 12th Earl of Stair (1879\u20131961), Scottish soldier and Conservative politician", "*John Dalrymple, 13th Earl of Stair (1906\u20131996), British peer", "*John Dalrymple, 14th Earl of Stair (born 1961), British politician", "*Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet (1726\u20131810), historian", "*John Dalrymple (died 1742) (1699\u20131742), Member of Parliament for Wigtown Burghs, 1728\u20131734", "* John Hamilton (1715\u20131796), Scottish politician born John Dalrymple, MP for Wigtown Burghs and Wigtownshire", "*John Dalrymple (political writer) (1734\u20131779), Scottish writer", "*John Dalrymple (Royal Navy officer) (died 1798)", "*John Dalrymple (physician) (1803\u20131852), English ophthalmologist", "*John Dalrymple (cricketer) (born 1957), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Graves' ophthalmopathy", "response": ["| John Dalrymple (1803\u20131852)"]}, {"page": "Dalrymple's sign", "response": ["Dalrymple's sign is a widened palpebral (eyelid) opening, or eyelid spasm, seen in thyrotoxicosis (as seen in Graves' disease, exophthalmic goitre and other hyperthyroid conditions), causing abnormal wideness of the palpebral fissure.
