Their first single, \"Lovers of Today\", self-released on the Vengeance record label, was immediately made \"record of the week\" by three of the four main music papers. A year later they signed to CBS. Their next single \"Another Girl, Another Planet\" became a popular and influential song, and remains the band's best-known song. It is often featured on various musical box-sets featuring a punk rock or new wave theme.
