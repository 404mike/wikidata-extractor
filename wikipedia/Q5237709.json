Acknowledging \"it's a last-chance saloon\", Roberts said \"I've learnt just not to be a plonker for all my life.\" He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed \"I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as I wake up clean that's all that I need\". He signed a six-month contract at the end of the month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1\u20130 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was \"no substance\" to the report. In fact he went on to say \"he has a huge part to play\" in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts. Gannon's reign was quickly terminated, but Roberts still struggled to regain his form under caretaker-manager Mark Grew."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["|22|||| MF||David Morgan", "|  David Morgan"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["| ||MF|| David Morgan||Lincoln City||14 August 2012||2 January 2013", "| ||MF|| David Morgan||Dundee||31 January 2013||End of season"]}, {"page": "David Morgan (David Morgan (footballer))", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Morgan (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 9", "response": ["*  David Morgan (playing against Serbia)"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["| David Morgan", "|25 October 2013 ||MF|| David Morgan|| Tamworth||25 November 2013||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["|David Morgan"]}, {"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.
