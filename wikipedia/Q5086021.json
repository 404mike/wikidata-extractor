Women don't know the offside rule.\" Keys replied \"Course they don't.\" The comments were criticised by Sky Sports, football fans and the Football Association. On 24 January it was announced that both Gray and Keys would be banned for one game. On 25 January 2011, it was announced his contract was being terminated for unacceptable behaviour. Barney Francis, Sky Sports' managing director, said Gray was dismissed \"in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour in an off-air incident that took place in December 2010\".  The Daily Telegraph suggested that the Sky statement refers directly to a clip of Gray and Charlotte Jackson in rehearsals for the Sky Sports Christmas Special.
