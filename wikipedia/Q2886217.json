Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music.The album Trans-Europe Express was played over the PA before Joy Division's concerts. New Order's song \"Your Silent Face\" also has some similarities with \"Europe Endless\" and had a working title of \"KW1\", or \"Kraftwerk 1\". New Order also recorded a song called \"Krafty\" that appeared as a single and on the album Waiting for the Sirens' Call. New Order also sampled \"Uranium\" in its biggest hit \"Blue Monday\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of \"Hall of Mirrors\" on their 1987 album Through the Looking Glass, which was lauded by Ralf H\u00fctter: \"In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of 'Hall of Mirrors' by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary, just like the arrangements of Alexander B\u0103l\u0103nescu for his Balanescu Quartet release [of Possessed, 1992]. We also like the album El Baile Alem\u00e1n of Se\u00f1or Coconut a lot.\" Members of Blondie have admitted on several occasions that Kraftwerk were an important reference for their sound by the time they were working on their third album Parallel Lines. The worldwide hit \"Heart of Glass\" turned radically from an initial reggae-flavoured style to its distinctive electronic sound in order to imitate the technological approach of Kraftwerk's albums and adapt it to a disco concept. U2 recorded a cover version of \"Neon Lights\" as did Simple Minds. U2 included \"Neon Lights\" as the B-side of their 2004 single \"Vertigo\". Simple minds included theirs on an all-cover tunes album by same name. LCD Soundsystem song called \"Get Innocuous!\" is built on a sample of \"The Robots\". Rammstein also covered their song \"Das Modell\", releasing it as a non-album single in 1997.

NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context.Strongman (2008), p. 134. Over time, \"new wave\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \"new wave\" and no longer called \"punk\".

In their 1975 book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, Tyler and co-author Roy Carr bemoaned Harrison's \"didactically imposing said Holy Memoirs upon innocent record-collectors\" and declared the album's spiritual theme \"almost as offensive in its own way\" as Lennon and Yoko Ono's political radicalism on Some Time in New York City (1972).Carr & Tyler, p. 107.", "* Roy Carr & Tony Tyler, The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, Trewin Copplestone Publishing (London, 1978; )."]}, {"page": "Ram (album)", "response": ["Upon its release, Ram was poorly received by music critics. McCartney was particularly hurt by the harsh reviews \u2212 especially as he had attempted to address the points raised in criticism of his earlier album, McCartney, by adopting a more professional approach this time around.Schaffner, p. 144. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called Ram \"incredibly inconsequential\" and \"monumentally irrelevant\", and criticised its lack of intensity and energy. He added that it exposes McCartney as having \"benefited immensely from collaboration\" with the Beatles, particularly John Lennon, who \"held the reins in on McCartney's cutsie-pie, florid attempts at pure rock muzak\" and kept him from \"going off the deep end that leads to an album as emotionally vacuous as Ram\". Playboy accused McCartney of \"substituting facility for any real substance\", and compared it to \"watching someone juggle five guitars: It's fairly impressive, but you keep wondering why he bothers.\" In NME, Alan Smith further called it \"an excursion into almost unrelieved tedium\" and \"the worst thing Paul McCartney has ever done.\" Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, called it \"a bad record, a classic form/content mismatch\", and felt that McCartney succumbed to \"conspicuous consumption\" by overworking himself and obscenely producing a style of music meant to be soft and whimsical. In a slightly more positive note, Chris Charlesworth of Melody Maker found Ram an overall better record than McCartney, but still found it subpar to the recent releases of Harrison and Lennon. Charlesworth concluded: \"A good album by anybody's standards and certainly far better than the majority released by British groups and singers. Trouble is you expect too much from a man like Paul McCartney.\" Writing four years later, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler from NME suggested that \"it would be naive to have expected the McCartneys to produce anything other than a mediocre record\u00a0...

He says that the song was \"selling peace\" on a programme that aimed to foster international understanding in a climate of Cold War hostility, the Vietnam War and revolutionary unrest in the Third World. By contrast, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler detected self-parody in the song, saying that the Beatles sought to debunk their elevated status during the Summer of Love."]}, {"page": "Wild Life (Wings album)", "response": ["After announcing to the media the band's formation on 2 August 1971, the group were named \"Wings\" on 9 October. On 8 November, the group held a press party in London to announce both the group and Wild Life, which was released on 7 December, in both the UK and US, to lukewarm critical and commercial reaction. The album reached number 11 in the UK and number 10 in the US, where it went gold. At the same press party, in an interview with Melody Maker, McCartney said that the group should soon be performing live.

Writing in The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described \"Paperback Writer\" as \"the first Beatles single to receive less-than-universal acclaim\", saying that it was \"perhaps a trifle too 'clever'\" and criticism was focused on \"the triviality of the lyric and a slight nagging suspicion that the Beatles were playing at 'being songwriters' at a time when the world was waiting for The Word\". The band's apparent aloofness also alienated many of their fans, who wrote into Record Mirror to disparage the group's new music. The UK music press were similarly offended by the ads for the single, which included a second \"butcher\" photo appearing in full colour on the cover of Disc and Music Echo, accompanied by the caption \"Beatles: What a Carve-Up!\" In author Nicholas Schaffner's description, this image led \"one crusty columnist to rail against the importation of American 'sick humor' into the United Kingdom\"."]}, {"page": "The Idiot (album)", "response": ["The Idiot marks a drastic departure for Pop from the aggressive proto-punk sound of the Stooges, reflecting a more subdued, inward-looking sound featuring elements such as \"fragmented guitar figures, ominous basslines, and discordant, high-relief keyboard parts\" as well as his \"world-weary baritone.\" At the time of its release, Pop described The Idiot as \"a cross between James Brown and Kraftwerk\". Retrospectively, commentators have categorized The Idiot primarily as art rock, but have also noted the presence of gothic rock, industrial rock, post-punk, and punk rock. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray suggested that The Idiots electronic sound had been \"pioneered\" on Bowie's Low (1977), whereas in 2016, Nicholas Pegg described it as \"a stepping stone between Bowie's Station to Station and Low\". According to critic Simon Reynolds of Tidal Magazine, the album's \"mechanistic grooves, brittle drums and harsh guitar textures\" anticipated Bowie\u2019s Berlin Trilogy and allowed Bowie to explore his fascination with German electronic sounds inspired by Neu! and Cluster. Wesley Strick of Circus magazine described the music as \"mechanized\", similar to Bowie's \"Fame\", but \"with rhythms keyed off a quickened pulse\", while Richard Riegel of Creem calls it \"professional studio metal, with occasional German-electronic overtones\". NMEs Nick Kent described the music as \"totally rivetted and fettered to a thoroughly unhealthy aroma of evil and twilight zone zombie-time unease\".

Buckley has described the album as \"the first Bowie album proper\", while NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray similarly stated, \"this is where the story really starts\". Erlewine cited The Man Who Sold the World as the beginning of Bowie's \"classic period\". Similarly, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club called the album his \"career blueprint\", writing that it musically was a forerunner to the \"swaggering electric disorientation\" of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane (1973), but its greater importance on sequencing and atmosphere, as well as stonger songwriting, predated Hunky Dory. Meanwhile, Paul Trynka calls it Bowie's \"first truly gripping work\". Pegg calls The Man Who Sold the World one of the best and most important albums in the history of rock music. In a 2013 readers' poll for Rolling Stone, it was voted Bowie's tenth greatest album."]}, {"page": "Station to Station", "response": ["Although NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised it was cut \"in 10 days of feverish activity\", more recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months, and the sessions began in late September 1975 or early October and ending in late November. Initial working titles for the album included The Return of the Thin White Duke and Golden Years, named after the first track recorded. According to O'Leary, \"Golden Years\", which Bowie began writing before he began filming The Man Who Fell to Earth, was completed in ten days and issued as a single while the album was still being finished. Recording for \"TVC 15\" began shortly after the completion of \"Golden Years\"."]}]}}
