He also managed theatres at Northallerton and Morpeth. In Broadway, he performed in the Assembly Room of the Lygon Arms (formerly known as the White Hart Inn).The house in Westgate was during its long existence the only regular theatre in the town it used to announce itself on the bills simply as \" Theatre, Wakefield,\" but other places have been occasionally used for dramatic entertainments, and some of them may be noted in passing. Before the theatre was opened there were two rooms, both apparently attached to inns, which were taken possession of from time to time by the strolling player ; the one situated in the Bull Yard, and the other in the George Yard.
