At the time of the tour AFC Bournemouth had just won promotion to Football League Third Division. The AFC Bournemouth team included; Ian Leigh, John Impey, Brian Mundee, Chris Sulley, Milton Graham, Nigel Spackman, Keith Williams, Howard Goddard and Derek Dawkins. Injuries would see Bournemouth's coach Harry Redknapp and manager David Webb take the field for the English side playing its seventh game in fifteen days around the North Island. AFC Bournemouth, who scored 27 goals on the tour, had conceded only two before the match in New Plymouth, one against the Franklin County XI from Frank Verheyen and the other against Napier City Rovers scored by Graeme Hill. On Bournemouth's team list were also Brian O'Donnell, Andy Crawford, Richard Donovan, Tommy Heffernan, Phil Brignull and keeper Kenny Allen. Taranaki, playing in a gold coloured strip, won the match 2\u20131. It would be the only loss the Cherries would experience on their eight match national tour. Coached by Don Harris and assistant Chris MacIntosh, the Taranaki XI included captain Barry Cooper, Dan Hook and Wayne Gould from Moturoa-Spotswood AFC, keeper Hugh Davidson and Peter Burmester from Old Boys, Hawera's Peter Bodnar, City's Peter Dolan, Taranaki United's John Russell, Steve Lazarus, Schane Manley, Mick Mayhew and reserve keeper Wayne Martin with two guest players from Manurewa AFC, Kevin Birch and Mark Donaghue."]}, {"page": "Mundee", "response": ["*Brian Mundee (born 1964), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Mundee, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Mundee"]}, {"page": "Immigration to Malta", "response": ["* Brian Mundee"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| DF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Brian Mundee"]}]}}
