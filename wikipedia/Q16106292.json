Friday set up the game's only goal, beating three players before hitting the post with his shot; Ray Hiron scored from the rebound. Friday scored a powerful left-footed volley during the first half of a 2\u20132 draw away against Cambridge United two days later. The result secured Third Division football for Reading. At the celebratory dinner after the game, the Reading captain Gordon Cumming saw some fluted wine glasses, and voiced his admiration: \"I wouldn't mind a few of them for home\", he said. \"Give us a few minutes and I'll get them for you\", replied Friday. Going around the dining room and picking them off the tables, he stole a whole boxful of the glasses, which he managed to sneak out of the hotel and onto the team coach, but much to Cumming's annoyance he then decided to keep them for himself. With 22 goals for the year, 21 in the league, Friday was once more Reading's top goalscorer and for the second consecutive season the team's player of the year."]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|=||align=left|  Ray Hiron ||align=left| Portsmouth ||18||0||0||\u2014||18"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Football League", "response": ["|24||align=left|  Ray Hiron ||align=left| Portsmouth ||13||1||0||14"]}, {"page": "List of Portsmouth F.C. seasons", "response": ["|rowspan=3|Ray Hiron", "|Ray Hiron"]}]}}
