In July of the latter year he was appointed Chief Justice, in which capacity he administered the government during the absence of Sir Frederick Broome in England in 1884\u20135. Onslow's relations with that Governor having subsequently become strained, the latter threatened Onslow's security of tenure by \"interdicting\" him from his functions as Chief Justice, for the alleged premature and improper publication of certain correspondence then pending between them and with the Colonial Office. The Executive Council unanimously confirmed the interdict, and placed Mr. Onslow on half-pay pending the decision of the Colonial Office. In the result, Lord Knutsford reinstated Mr. Onslow, but censured him. Ultimately, in view of the attitude assumed by the Chief Justice in adjudicating on certain cases of newspaper libel, the Legislative Council passed a resolution requesting the Home Government, in the interests of tranquillity, to transfer him to some other location. He was accordingly given, a year's leave of absence but this was extended. In February 1890 it was announced that he was to exchange posts with Sir Elliot Bovill, Chief Justice of Cyprus. This arrangement did not actually take place and Sir Henry T. Wrensfordsley was sent out to the colony in 1890 as Acting Chief Justice.  Mr. Onslow returned to Western Australia and resumed his occupancy of the office of Chief Justice in July 1891. Onslow was knighted in 1895 for services rendered to the Queen's colonies since 1878."]}, {"page": "Former cemeteries in Singapore", "response": ["12 gravestones, including those of Sir Elliot Bovill, Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements from 1892 to 1893, and Hans Hermann Eschke, the first German Consul-General in Singapore, were moved to Fort Canning Green.
