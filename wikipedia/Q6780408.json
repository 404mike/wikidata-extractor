In 1979 he controversially refused to publish an Observer article by Mary Holland, the paper's Ireland correspondent. Holland, whose reporting won her a Journalist of the Year award, had been one of the first journalists to explain discrimination in Northern Ireland to a British audience. The article was a profile of Mary Nelis of Derry and dealt with her radicalisation as a result of the conflict. Cruise O'Brien objected and sent Holland a memo stating that the \"killing strain\" of Irish republicanism \"has a very high propensity to run in families and the mother is most often the carrier\". The memo continued, \"It is a very serious weakness of your coverage of Irish affairs that you are a very poor judge of Irish Catholics. That gifted and talkative community includes some of the most expert conmen and conwomen in the world and I believe you have been conned\".See 'Conor Cruise O'Brien and Mary Holland contract termination Observer (London) 1979', https://www.academia.edu/35030894/  Holland was forced out of the newspaper by Cruise O'Brien. She later joined The Irish Times as a columnist. She also rejoined The Observer after Cruise O'Brien's departure in 1981."]}, {"page": "Kennedy Lindsay", "response": ["Lindsay withdrew from politics after his new party failed to make any headway. He then turned his attention to writing books about the British secret service operations in Northern Ireland, including Ambush at Tullywest and The British Intelligence Services in Action. The former, Ambush at Tullywest, would later be quoted by Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Mary Nelis in a Northern Ireland Assembly debate on security forces collusion in Northern Ireland. Lindsay briefly returned in 1982 to stand in an Assembly election in South Antrim as a candidate for the United Ulster Unionist Party, although he and his running mate Samuel Larmour came bottom of the poll."]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Mary Nelis", "|Mary Nelis"]}, {"page": "1935 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Mary Nelis - Sinn F\u00e9in MLA."]}, {"page": "Foyle (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=3|Mary Nelis(Sinn F\u00e9in)", "| align=\"right\" |Martin McGuinnessMitchel McLaughlinMary NelisMoira McCloskeyGary Fleming"]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Mary Nelis"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Mary Nelis"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Mary Nelis"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Mary Nelis"]}, {"page": "Nelis", "response": ["*Mary Nelis (1998\u20132004), Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly"]}]}}
