He was twice British Champion Amateur Jump Jockey, before becoming a celebrated journalist and recognisable racing personality both on television and through his charitable work for the Injured Jockeys Fund, which he helped establish.

Foremost among these for many years was the BBC's Sir Peter O'Sullevan, known as 'the voice of racing', who commentated on 50 Grand Nationals. Channel 4's most recognisable racing figure was John McCririck, famed for his eccentric dress sense and use of the bookmakers' sign language 'tic-tac'. Other notable presenters of Channel 4's coverage included Derek Thompson, John Francome, John Oaksey and Brough Scott. Clare Balding transferred from the BBC in 2013 to become lead presenter."]}, {"page": "Shergar", "response": ["The first phone call from the thieves was on the night Shergar was stolen; Fitzgerald was not back at Ballymany by that time, and had not had the chance to tell the news of the theft to anyone. The call was to Jeremy Maxwell, a horse trainer based in Northern Ireland. The caller demanded \u00a340,000, although this figure was later raised to \u00a352,000. Maxwell was told that the negotiations would only be with three British horse racing journalists, Derek Thompson and John Oaksey of ITV and Peter Campling from The Sun. The men were told to be at the Europa Hotel in central Belfast by the Thursday evening; the Europa was known as the most bombed hotel in Europe after having suffered multiple bomb attacks during the Troubles."]}, {"page": "Through the Keyhole", "response": ["| 2 || Katie BoyleWillie RushtonChris Tarrant || Sheila FergusonLord John Oaksey || 16 March 1990"]}, {"page": "ITV Racing", "response": ["Over the years, the live coverage was presented by John Rickman (until 1977), Brough Scott, Ken Butler, Lord Oaksey (initially known on the programme as John Lawrence, and subsequently becoming John Oaksey after he succeeded to the peerage), and Derek Thompson and Jim McGrath (from 1981 onwards).

Porchester then read a prepared statement. It said that Mercer would be removed as stable jockey at the end of the season to be replaced by Willie Carson. The announcement created almost universal outcry from the press, Hern's other owners and others in racing. An almost immediate response from John Oaksey on ITV was, 'The mind boggles if you are not satisfied with Joe Mercer'.", "He was noted as a great stylist in the saddle. \"Just watch carefully the next time Joe Mercer gets involved in a finish on television. In my carefully considered opinion, it is very hard indeed to believe that a more effective, more stylish or more aesthetically satisfying method exists of persuading a thoroughbred horse to go faster,\" wrote the journalist John Oaksey"]}]}}
