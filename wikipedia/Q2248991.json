His father Increase had preached at the trial of Dutch pirate Peter Roderigo; Cotton Mather in turn preached at the trials and sometimes executions of pirate Captains (or the crews of) William Fly, John Quelch, Samuel Bellamy, William Kidd, Charles Harris, and John Phillips. He also ministered to Thomas Hawkins, Thomas Pound, and William Coward; having been convicted of piracy, they were jailed alongside \"Mary Glover the Irish Catholic witch,\" daughter of witch \"Goody\" Ann Glover at whose trial Mather had also preached.", "In his conversations with William Fly and his crew Mather scolded them: \"You have something within you, that will compell you to confess, That the Things which you have done, are most Unreasonable and Abominable. The Robberies and Piracies, you have committed, you can say nothing to Justify them.  \u2026  It is a most hideous Article in the Heap of Guilt lying on you, that an Horrible Murder is charged upon you; There is a cry of Blood going up to Heaven against you.\""]}, {"page": "Piracy", "response": ["In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death.

French historian Alexandre Exquemelin reports the buccaneer Fran\u00e7ois l'Ollonais using a cutlass as early as 1667. Pirates used these weapons for intimidation as much as for combat, often needing no more than to grip their hilts to induce a crew to surrender, or beating captives with the flat of the blade to force their compliance or responsiveness to interrogation."]}, {"page": "Fly (disambiguation)", "response": ["* William Fly (died 1726), English pirate"]}, {"page": "List of pirates", "response": ["| William Fly", "* Pirates hold: William Fly"]}, {"page": "Golden Age of Piracy", "response": ["* William Fly, whose execution in 1726 is used by historian Marcus Rediker to mark the end of the Golden Age of Pirates."]}, {"page": "Edward Low", "response": ["Edward Low's acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such as Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach, Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts, and William Fly, led to a great increase in the military presence to protect shipping lanes, resulting in the effective end of the Golden Age of Piracy."]}, {"page": "Nixes Mate", "response": ["In 1636, Nix's Mate was granted to John Gallop, a harbor pilot who lived on nearby Gallops Island and used the then  island for grazing his sheep. Ship's ballast was quarried from the island during the 17th century, followed by slate in the 18th century, resulting in today's much smaller island. In 1726, upon the arrest of pirate Captain \"Under the Black Flag\" David CordinglyWilliam Fly, officials brought him to Boston where he was executed.  His body was then gibbetted on Nixes Mate to serve as a warning to sailors not to turn to piracy. Before Fly's execution, he famously scolded the hangman for incorrectly securing his noose, then re-tied it himself.

He showed no anxiety over his imminent demise, but rather tied his own noose and lectured the hangman about the proper way to tie the knot. Right before he swung off to his death he delivered a warning to all ships captains and owners that in order to prevent their crews from mutinying and resorting to piracy, they would be wise to pay their crews on time and treat them humanly.", "The gallows were an icon of the 17th and 18th century and could be readily found throughout the Atlantic world. The gallows were particular visible in port cities that routinely featured an execution dock such as \"Hope Point\" the famous execution dock on the river Thames in Wapping, England. For many pirates this would be the place that their career was put to an end. For some, however, their body would serve one more function, as a reminder. Hundreds of pirates were hanged and their bodies left to dangle in port cities around the world as a reminder that the maritime state would not tolerate a challenge from below. Examples of this barbarous practice can be seen throughout pirate history, including those of William Fly, whose body was hung in chains at the entrance of Boston Harbor to rot, and Calico Jack, whose body was hung at the mouth of the harbor of Port Royal, Jamaica."]}, {"page": "Fly, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Fly"]}]}}
