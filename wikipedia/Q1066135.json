In 1856, Stent added several other materials to the gutta-percha, notably stearine, which markedly improved the plasticity of the material as well as its stability. He also added talc as an inert filler to give more body to the material, and red colouring.\nThe medical device called a stent is thought to derive its name from him.\nCharles Thomas Stent was born at Royal Crescent, Brighton, on 17 October 1807. He was the 6th son of William and Hannah (n\u00e9e Jenkin) Stent. He had 2 sons, Charles Robert and Howard and a daughter, Fanny.

Others attribute the noun \"stent\" to Jan F. Esser, a Dutch plastic surgeon who in 1916 used the word to describe a dental impression compound invented in 1856 by the English dentist Charles Stent (1807\u20131885), whom Esser employed to craft a form for facial reconstruction. The full account is described in the Journal of the History of Dentistry.  According to the author, from the use of Stent's compound as a support for facial tissues evolved the use of a stent to hold open various body structures."]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Charles Stent \u2013 dentist after whom the medical Stent is named"]}, {"page": "List of eponyms (L\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Charles Stent, British dentist \u2013 a \"stent\" (tooth filling)"]}, {"page": "List of dentists", "response": ["*Charles Stent \u2013 dentist who advanced Dentures making"]}, {"page": "Stent (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Stent (1807\u20131885), English dentist for whom the medical stent is named"]}, {"page": "Jan F.
