He is known for his photographic projects that take an intimate, satirical and anthropological look at aspects of modern life, in particular documenting the social classes of England, and more broadly the wealth of the Western world.\nHis major projects have been rural communities (1975\u20131982), The Last Resort (1983\u20131985), The Cost of Living (1987\u20131989), Small World (1987\u20131994) and Common Sense (1995\u20131999).\nSince 1994, Parr has been a member of Magnum Photos. He has had around 40 solo photobooks published, and has featured in around 80 exhibitions worldwide \u2013 including the international touring exhibition ParrWorld, and a retrospective at the Barbican Arts Centre, London, in 2002.The Martin Parr Foundation, founded in 2014, opened premises in his hometown of Bristol in 2017.
