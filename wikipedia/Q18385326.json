Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \"[Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate. According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate. Diana remained a prominent figure for her fashion style, and is still considered an inspiration for stylists, celebrities, and young women. Diana's daughters-in-law, Catherine and Meghan, are believed to be influenced by her in developing their own professional wardrobe. One of Diana's favourite milliners, John Boyd, said \"Diana was our best ambassador for hats, and the entire millinery industry owes her a debt.\" Boyd's pink tricorn hat Diana wore for her honeymoon was later copied by milliners across the world and credited with rebooting an industry in decline for decades."]}, {"page": "Philip Treacy", "response": ["* John Boyd, milliner"]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* John Boyd"]}, {"page": "John Boyd", "response": ["John Boyd may refer to:", "*Sir John Boyd, 1st Baronet (1718\u20131800), English sugar merchant", "*Sir John Boyd, 2nd Baronet (1750\u20131815), son of the first baronet Boyd", "*Sir John Boyd (diplomat) (1936\u20132019), British ambassador and former master of Churchill College, Cambridge", "*John Boyd (Irish politician) (1789\u20131862), UK MP for the Irish constituency of Coleraine, 1842\u20131852 and 1857\u20131862", "*Sir John Boyd of Maxpoffle (1826\u20131895), Lord Provost of Edinburgh 1888 to 1891", "*John Boyd (Assemblyman) (1824\u2013?), English-born Wisconsin State Assemblyman", "*John Boyd (Connecticut politician) (1799\u20131881), Connecticut state legislator and Secretary of State", "*John Boyd (Texas politician) (1796\u20131873), American early settler in Texas and state senator", "*John Boyd (farmer) (born 1965), American farmer and civil rights leader", "*John Boyd (Canadian politician) (1826\u20131893), Senator and lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick", "*John Boyd (military strategist) (1927\u20131997), US Air Force Colonel and fighter pilot", "*John Boyd (photographer) (1865\u20131941), Canadian amateur photographer and railway official", "*John Boyd (playwright) (1912\u20132002), Northern Irish playwright", "*John Boyd (author) (1919\u20132013), science fiction author", "*John Boyd (milliner) (1925\u20132018), fashion designer", "*John Boyd (conductor) (born 1944), American conductor and arranger, worked with Joseph Hermann", "*John Boyd (sound engineer), American sound engineer", "*John Boyd (actor) (born 1981), American actor", "*John Boyd (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131927), Scottish footballer", "*John Boyd (footballer, born 1929) (1929\u20132019), Scottish footballer (1948 Great Britain Olympic team)", "*John Boyd (footballer, born 1969), Scottish footballer (Dumbarton FC, St Mirren)", "*John Boyd (trade unionist) (1917\u20131989), Scottish trade unionist", "*John Boyd (Bahamas), free person of color in the 19th century", "*John Boyd (pastor) (1679\u20131708), Presbyterian minister in the United States", "*John Boyd (police officer) (born 1933), HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland", "*John Boyd (bacteriologist) (1891\u20131981), bacteriologist and Royal Army Medical Corps officer", "*John Boyd Orr (1880\u20131971), Nobel peace laureate"]}, {"page": "Caroline Reboux", "response": ["* John Boyd, milliner"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish artists", "response": ["*John Boyd (1925\u20132018), milliner "]}, {"page": "1925 in Scotland", "response": ["* 5 April \u2013 John Boyd, milliner, based in London (died 2018)"]}, {"page": "John Boyd (Milliner)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Boyd (milliner)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2018", "response": ["*John Boyd, 92, Scottish milliner.Obituary: John Boyd MBE, milliner who went from humble Edinburgh beginnings to making hats for royalty"]}]}}
