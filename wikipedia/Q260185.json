He took five wickets in an innings 22\u00a0times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1\u20130. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41\u00a0overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30\u00a0runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: \"Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether to hit you for four or six!\"Bowes, p. 124. South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25\u00a0overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40\u00a0overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches.  In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: \"Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen\". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball."]}, {"page": "Sid Barnes", "response": ["Unfortunately for Barnes, he broke his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour, keeping the injury secret until the tourists had departed Gibraltar, for fear of being sent home.Smith p. 26., quoting Barnes \"I had jog-trotted six times around the ship the morning we were due to land in Gibraltar and I started stretching exercises. I leapt to catch the steel rope running across the deck to hold up the sun awnings but the early morning mist had made the stachion slippery and I couldn't hold it. I slipped back and, in falling, threw out my left hand to break the fall. I fell with all my weight on the left hand\u00a0...\" Smith continues, \"A few hours later the pain increased and the hand started to swell. He said nothing just in case there was a ship in Gibraltar on its way back to Australia\u00a0...\" On arrival in England, he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June, missing exactly half of the 30\u00a0first-class matches scheduled for the tour, including the first two Tests, both of which were drawn. His first innings was 42 against Derbyshire and he shared in a fourth\u00a0wicket stand of 176 with Bill Brown, who made an unbeaten 265. The third Test was a wash-out and he was not picked for the fourth, which the Australians won, although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper, having deputised for Ben Barnett in that role in tour matches against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire.Barnes, p. 78. In the event, his Test debut came in the final Test, played at The Oval. Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903\u00a0for seven\u00a0declared, then the highest Test score. Barnes bowled 38\u00a0overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket, that of Arthur Wood, for 84\u00a0runs. With both Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton injured and unable to bat, Australia struggled \u2013 England won by an innings and 579\u00a0runs \u2013 still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history; but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and, according to Wisden, \"well justified his choice\". In all first-class matches on the tour, Barnes scored 720\u00a0runs, and reached 90 three times, though without going on to a first-class century. He scored 140 in a two-day match against Durham, which was not considered first-class."]}, {"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["Yorkshire at this time was in a period of transition. They had won the championship four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930.", "Bowes in 1930 was a significant factor in what Kilburn called Yorkshire's \"year of changeover\". Rhodes retired at the end of the season with his replacement Verity already in situ. Arthur Wood, with whom Bowes was to work so well, established himself as the successor to Arthur Dolphin as Yorkshire's keeper. Yorkshire's batting was already strong, based on the triumvirate of Sutcliffe, Holmes and Leyland. It has always been said that bowlers win both matches and championships; in the partnership of Bowes and Verity, Yorkshire were onto a winning combination. For his part, Verity with his slow-medium left-arm bowling was virtually unplayable on sticky wickets, while Bowes enhanced his natural armoury of pace, lift and in-swing by learning how to bowl out-swing too. As Kilburn put it, 1930 was a season that \"gave sight of the great team to come as the embers of a great team past were being raked out\"."]}, {"page": "Eccleshill, Bradford", "response": ["Arthur Wood (1898\u20131973), a Yorkshire and England cricketer was born in Fagley"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Arthur Wood \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Arthur Dolphin", "response": ["Arthur Dolphin (24 December 1885 \u2013 23 October 1942) was an English first-class cricketer, who kept wicket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1905 and 1927.
