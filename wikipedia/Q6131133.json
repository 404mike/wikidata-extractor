In the 1954 case Ex parte Kolczynski,R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Kolczynski, [1954] 1 Q.B. 540. English courts first extended the political incidence test to events that were not part of political unrest: a revolt by seven Polish sailors who mutinied against their captain and took their ship to the United Kingdom. Judges James Cassels and Rayner Goddard interpreted \"political disturbance\" far more broadly than in Castolini, finding even in the absence of an uprising that the offenders' crimes had been committed as part of efforts to avoid prosecution for political crimes. The case has been described as \"the farthest extension\" of the political offence exception. In 1962, the next major case in this regard, Schtraks v Israel,Schtraks v Government of Israel and Others, [1964] AC 556, [1962] 3 All ER 529, [1962] 3 WLR 1013. Available here at the website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Lord Radcliffe laid down the outer limits of what could constitute a \"political disturbance\" under the liberal Kolczynski definition, finding that it required that \"the fugitive is at odds with the state that applies for his extradition on some issue connected with the political control or government of the country\". The court found that while Schtraks' alleged offence of kidnapping his nephew to ensure that he had an Orthodox Jewish education was a matter of political controversy in Israel, he had done it purely for personal motivations without any intention of furthering political change, and so found that his offence was not of a political character."]}]}}
