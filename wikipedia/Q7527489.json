From humble beginnings in a farming family in Ayrshire, he became a successful merchant and politician; he was a relation of Robert Burns and used his wealth to support Burns's orphaned children. As Lord Mayor of London, he led the funeral procession of Lord Nelson in 1806, having established his right to do so and was created baronet twice, in 1809 and 1813. While later Chamberlain of London, he almost lost his own fortune due to injudicious investments, and died, exonerated, in 1843.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["| 1805 || Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet || Scrivener ||"]}, {"page": "James Shaw", "response": ["* Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131843), Lord Mayor of London and MP for the City of London 1806\u20131818"]}, {"page": "Statue of James Shaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "James Shaw Statue", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Shaw baronets", "response": ["thumb|right|220px|Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet", "*Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131843)", "*Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (1764\u20131843)"]}, {"page": "Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet of Kilmarnock", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "James Shaw, 1st Baronet of Kilmarnock", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet, of Kilmarnock", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "James Shaw (1764-1843)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "James Fillans", "response": ["*Statue of Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (former Lord Mayor of London), Kilmarnock (1848)"]}, {"page": "Sir James Shaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet"]}]}}
