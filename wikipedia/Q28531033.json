He has been voted one of the most influential disabled people in the UK, and was one of the first television presenters in the world with a physical disability.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Association for Bikers with a Disability", "response": ["*Mik Scarlet, TV presenter and disc jockey"]}, {"page": "Me Before You (film)", "response": ["The film sparked criticism from many in the disability rights movement, who perceive an underlying message that people with disabilities are a burden on their families and carers, and claim the film promotes the view that people are better off dead than disabled. They view the film as advocating suicide so that their loved ones can \"live boldly\". Others found the film exploitative of the disability community by stirring the emotions of viewers without actually aiding the disabled by accurate representation or employment in acting roles, while pointing out the casting of able-bodied actors as disabled characters. The #MeBeforeEuthanasia backlash was led by celebrities with disabilities including Liz Carr, Penny Pepper, Mik Scarlet, and Cherylee Houston in the United Kingdom, and Dominick Evans and Emily Ladau  in the United States, as well as activists from Not Dead Yet in both countries. Protests in the United States occurred in cities including Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Hartford, Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore and Philadelphia. There were also protests in Australia."]}]}}
