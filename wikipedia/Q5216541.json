During the summer break, Ainsworth rebuilt his squad, with the addition of Paul Hayes for a second spell at the club. The 2014\u201315 season saw the club spend the majority of the season in the automatic promotion places. However, two costly home defeats to Morecambe and local rivals Oxford United led to a finishing position of 4th, setting up a play-off fixture against Plymouth Argyle. The play-off final took place on 23 May and within five seconds of kick-off Wycombe midfielder Sam Saunders pulled his calf muscle and had to be substituted for Matt Bloomfield in the fourth minute. During the regular 90 minutes both teams had a goal disallowed, but neither managed to score. Four minutes into extra time Wycombe were awarded a free kick just outside the Southend penalty area. Joe Jacobson took the free kick and the ball rebounded off keeper Daniel Bentley and into the net. Southend continued to put pressure on Wycombe until Joe Pigott scored in the 122nd minute to tie the game at 1\u20131 and send it to a penalty shoot out. Southend won the shoot out 7\u20136 when Sam Wood's effort was saved by Bentley."]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["|2014\u201315||Daniel Bentley"]}, {"page": "Luke Daniels", "response": ["On 24 May 2017, Daniels joined Championship club Brentford on a free transfer and signed a three-year contract, with an option for a further year, effective 1 July 2017.

Aside from cup appearances and two league starts, Daniels was again backup to Daniel Bentley for the majority of the 2018\u201319 season, until a season-ending shoulder injury suffered by Bentley in March 2019 allowed Daniels a run in the team in league matches and he finished the season with 19 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Branislav Ivanovi\u0107", "response": ["Although suffering a minor injury in the beginning of pre-season, Ivanovi\u0107 returned during Chelsea's tour of the United States and continue to rotate throughout the games with young right back Ola Aina.

However, preceding Chelsea's 3\u20130 defeat against Arsenal in September, Ivanovi\u0107 was replaced by Victor Moses for the foreseeable future. This, therefore, forced manager Antonio Conte to switch to his favored 3\u20134\u20133 formation in their 2\u20130 victory over Hull City.
