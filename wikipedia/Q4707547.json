W. Liscombe writes that Fry, frustrated at the prevailing conservatism of British architecture and society, renounced Reilly's neo-classicism in favour of \"an independent functionalist design idiom modified from the main German and French progenitors of the modern movement\". Liscombe adds that the \"austere formalism and social idealism\" of continental modernism appealed to Fry's moral outlook and his desire for social change. Fry's biographer Alan Powers writes that the change in Fry's aesthetic views came gradually; he continued to design in the neo-classical style for some years: \"As a partner in Adams, Thompson and Fry, he designed a garden village at Kemsley near Sittingbourne in 1929, and a house at Wentworth, Surrey, in 1932, in the refined neo-Georgian style typical of the Liverpool school.\"  Wells Coates, a colleague at Adams, Thompson and Fry tried to enthuse Fry with the example of Le Corbusier, but his conversion to modernism, in Powers's words, \"came principally through his membership of the Design and Industries Association, which introduced him to modern German housing. ... [Fry] was also influenced by the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne, and was closely involved in its English branch, the Modern Architectural Research (MARS) Group, following its establishment in 1933.\" Even after his espousal of modernism, Fry remained fond of neo-classical architecture, lending his support to a campaign to preserve Nash's Carlton House Terrace in the 1930s.\"Carlton House Terrace\", The Times, 11 January 1933, p. 8"]}, {"page": "Naum Slutzky", "response": ["* Alan Powers, \"Britain and The Bauhaus\", in Apollo magazine, May 2006."]}, {"page": "Clive Aslet", "response": ["*The National Trust book of the English house (with Alan Powers; Penguin, 1985) ()"]}, {"page": "Oliver Hill (architect)", "response": ["Hill also became known for luxurious interior decoration.
