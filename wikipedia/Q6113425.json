A strong, powerful half-back, Jack Keenan came to Burnley from Clitheroe, his home-town club, in 1884 and quickly established himself in a team consisting almost entirely of Scots. Keenan was a regular in his early days at Turf Moor and his consistency brought him to the fringe of international honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill McFettridge", "response": ["McFettridge soon established himself in the Burnley team and showed himself to be a versatile player with an ability to play in attack or defence. However, he soon made the right-half position his own and built a strong relationship with left-half Jack Keenan.
