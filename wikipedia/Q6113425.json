A strong, powerful half-back, Jack Keenan came to Burnley from Clitheroe, his home-town club, in 1884 and quickly established himself in a team consisting almost entirely of Scots. Keenan was a regular in his early days at Turf Moor and his consistency brought him to the fringe of international honours.", "link_mentions": {}}}
