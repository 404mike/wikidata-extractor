Somerset had arrived in Manchester a player short for their fixture against Lancashire, and had to seek special permission to include Stanley in their team. Stanley lived in Manchester, but had been born in Somerset, and thus qualified for the county. His only first-class appearance was not successful; he did not bowl, and scored no runs in either innings of the match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Stanley", "response": ["Edward Stanley may refer to:", "*Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle (c. 1460\u20131523), English soldier and peer", "*Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (1509\u20131572), English nobleman", "*Edward Stanley (MP for Merioneth) (by 1513\u201364 or later), MP for Merioneth", "*Edward Stanley (MP for Flint Boroughs) (1521/22?\u20131609), MP for Flint Boroughs", "*Edward Stanley (1639\u20131664), Member of Parliament for Lancashire", "*Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby (1689\u20131776), British peer and politician", "*Edward Stanley (bishop) (1779\u20131849), Bishop of Norwich", "*Edward Stanley (1790\u20131863), Member of Parliament for West Cumberland, 1832\u20131852", "*Edward Stanley (surgeon) (1793\u20131862), author of books on surgery, twice President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England", "*Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley (1802\u20131869), British politician", "*Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (1826\u20131893), British statesman, twice Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "*Edward Stanley (Bridgwater MP) (1826\u20131907), Member of Parliament for West Somerset and Bridgwater", "*Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1839\u20131925), English educationalist", "*Edward Stanley (cricketer) (1852\u20131896), English cricketer", "*Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby (1865\u20131948), British soldier, Conservative politician, diplomat and racehorse owner", "*Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (died 1938) (1894\u20131938), British Conservative politician", "*Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1907\u20131971), English nobleman", "*Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby (1918\u20131994), British peer", "*Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby (born 1962), British peer", "*Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (born 1998), son of the 19th Earl of Derby"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Edward Stanley (1884) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1884", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Edward Stanley "]}, {"page": "Harry Winter (cricketer)", "response": ["Winter's single appearance in first-class cricket for Somerset came in the match against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in August 1884 and is, like that of Edward Stanley in Somerset's following match against Lancashire, the subject of some mystery. In the contemporary report of the first day's play in the match in The Times newspaper, the day finished with Kent's first innings completed and Somerset at 30 for three wickets, and among the Somerset players yet to bat was John Challen. In the report of the second day's play in the following day's newspaper, when Somerset's first innings had been completed, Challen is not in the team and \"Mr H. E. Winter\" is the No 11 batsman, having made an unbeaten 24. Winter made 0 in the second innings and also bowled a single (four-ball) over which went for nine runs.
