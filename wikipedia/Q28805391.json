He spent the second half of the 2017\u201318 season on loan at Port Vale. He spent the first half of the 2018\u201319 season on loan at Spanish club Jumilla and joined Exeter City on loan for the second half of the season. He returned to Spain to sign with Burgos in July 2019, before joining English side Macclesfield Town in February 2020. He signed with Bath City in September 2020 and loaned out to Sutton United in March 2021, and joined the club on a permanent basis after helping Sutton to win the National League title at the end of the 2020\u201321 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale opened the New Year with a 1\u20130 defeat at second-placed Notts County, and though Aspin was pleased with his players he was highly critical of the referee for his award of a late penalty, calling it \"a really bad decision\". Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||28||align=\"left\"| Donovan Wilson", "|\u2013||FW||||28||Donovan Wilson||1||0||0||0||1", "| 11 January 2018 || CF ||  || Donovan Wilson || Wolverhampton Wanderers || 30 June 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 11 January 2018 || Donovan Wilson ||align=\"center\"| Port Vale ||align=\"center\"| End of season"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["Southampton were knocked out of the 2017\u201318 EFL Cup in their first match of the tournament, losing 2\u20130 in the second round to Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers.
