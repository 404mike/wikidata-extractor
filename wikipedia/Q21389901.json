A naturalized Canadian, he was a federal research scientist for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada at what is today the Ottawa Research and Development Centre.Throughout his professional career he has made exceptional contributions to the field of taxonomy which significantly advanced this science in Canada and around the world. His contributions not only benefited his chosen field, but unwittingly, benefited our global society by introducing a more sophisticated and scientific method of classifying fungi to enable more in-depth research on moulds. His mentorship of young scientists throughout his career also helped create a new generation of mycology taxonomists who are dedicated to and enthralled by their research.", "link_mentions": []}}
