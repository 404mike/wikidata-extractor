The latter red card coincided with a four match suspension for defensive partner Steve McNulty, who was sent off for a studs-up challenge in the previous match, a 2\u20132 draw at home to York City.

On the opening day of the 2013\u201314 season, an injury to regular captain Ronnie Henry and a red card for vice-captain Steve McNulty meant that Lacey, at the age of 20, had the unusual distinction of captaining Luton on his first league start for the club; a 1\u20130 defeat to Southport. Lacey played in central defence in Luton's opening six games of the 2013\u201314 season, during which the team kept four clean sheets. He scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20130 win against Woking on 25 September 2013 and remained in the starting XI as Luton embarked on a club-record 27 league game unbeaten run. He fractured a metatarsal in a 3\u20130 win against Southport in November 2013, which sidelined him for three months. By the time Lacey had recovered, he had been replaced in central defence by Fraser Franks. With his Luton contract set to expire at the end of the season, Lacey was linked with potential moves to Bournemouth, Charlton Athletic, Millwall and Peterborough United. However, on 3 April 2014, Lacey signed a two-year contract extension with Luton.
