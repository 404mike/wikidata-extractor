His advent coincided with the passing of the Theatres Act 1843 which broke the duopoly in drama of the Theatres Royal and so Phelps, with scene painter T. L. Greenwood and leading lady Mrs Mary Warner, was able to introduce a programme of Shakespeare to the Wells. His productions (from 1844 to 1862), notably of Macbeth (1844), Antony and Cleopatra (1849) and Pericles (1854), were much admired. The well-known actress Isabella Glyn made her first notable appearance as Lady Macbeth on this stage. Phelps was followed between 1863 and 1869 by lessee Robert Edgar and his wife, actress Alice Marriott, who continued the same programme alongside contemporary plays.Sadlers Wells theatre archive: Miss Marriott the female Hamlet, by Carys Lewis, 17 November 2011 In 1870 the lessee and manager was the actor William Henry Pennington, a former soldier.Roy Dutton, Forgotten Heroes: The Charge of the Light Brigade, InfoDial Ltd, (2007) - Google Books pg. 180"]}, {"page": "The Duchess of Malfi", "response": ["In 1850, after a generation of critical interest and theatrical neglect, the play was staged by Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells, with Isabella Glyn in the title role.

The production was favourably reviewed by The Athenaeum; George Henry Lewes, however, registered disapproval of the play's violence and what he termed its shoddy construction: \"Instead of 'holding the mirror up to nature,' this drama holds the mirror up to Madame Tussauds.\" These would become the cornerstones of criticisms of Webster for the next century. Still, the play was popular enough for Glyn to revive her performance periodically for the next two decades."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish actors", "response": ["*Isabella Glyn (1823\u20131889)"]}, {"page": "Eneas Sweetland Dallas", "response": ["In December 1853, he married, according to Scottish law, the well-known actress Miss Isabella Glyn (then the widow of Edward Wills), and on 12 July 1855, he was again married to her at St George's, Hanover Square.
