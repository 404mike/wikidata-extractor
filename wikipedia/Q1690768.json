One of these women is Joan Morgan who wrote her book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost to discuss her experiences as a Black woman and her relationship with hip-hop feminism. In the chapter titled \"strongblackwomen\" she discusses her choice to retire from being a Strong Black Woman. She states that \"Retirement was ultimately an act of salvation. Being an SBW was killing me slowly. Cutting off my air supply.\" This speaks to the weight that Black Women feel on their shoulders from trying to uphold the SBW schema. She continues to write about how her life became consumed with solving other peoples problems and left no time to take care of herself. This is the dark side to the SBW schema where Black Women have been shown stereotypes like the Mammy figure on television throughout their life and seen examples of their own mother or other women in their life upholding the Strong Black Woman lifestyle. These expectations to be a Strong Black Woman at all times become internalized and influence the ability for Black Woman to show any kind of weakness that their white counterparts are allowed to show.
