These nudie-cuties followed the formula of being humorous films with hapless, bumbling males and glorified women. The groundbreaking The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959) directed by Russ Meyer was the first of such films. In that film, the context for the presentation of female nudity was the fantasies of the main character. The film is widely considered the first pornographic feature not confined to under-the-counter distribution, and the film was commercially successful. Russ Meyer made two more nudie-cuties: Wild Gals of the Naked West, and Eve and the Handyman, starring his wife Eve in the title role. For the next few years a wave of such films, known as \"nudies\" or \"nudie-cuties\", were produced for adult theatres (in the United States sometimes called grindhouse theatres). The films bailed out movie houses that were facing stiff competition from television at the time. Nudie-cutie advertising was packed with tag-lines such as \"You'll Never See This on TV\". Films in this genre included Doris Wishman's science fiction spoof Nude on the Moon (1961), the Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman film The Adventures of Lucky Pierre (1961), and Ed Woods horror-nudie Orgy of the Dead (1965), with its bevy of topless dancers from beyond the grave, following his Western screenplay Revenge of the Virgins (1959), which shows a fierce tribe of bare-breasted Indian women hunting a group of treasure seekers. There were very many other similar films and sequels. One of the most renowned nudie-cuties is The Imp-probable Mr Weegee, a pseudo-documentary in which famed crime photographer Arthur Fellig, nicknamed \"Mr. WeeGee\", stars as himself. In the film, he falls in love with a store window dummy. Besides Russ Meyer, the only director in this field to go on to critical success is Francis Ford Coppola, who began his career writing and directing a pair of nudie comedies in 1962, Tonight for Sure and The Bellboy and the Playgirls.

Bob Guccione started Penthouse in the United Kingdom in 1965 with to compete against Playboy.

In 1965, Mayfair was launched in the UK in competition with both Playboy and Penthouse. As competition between the magazines escalated, their photos became increasingly more explicit.
