There it generated interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the Biblical account of creation, which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old, it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself. It was later sold for \u00a345 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a \"Crocodile in a Fossil State\" to Charles Konig, of the British Museum, who had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus for it.", "Other ichthyosaur remains had been discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings was the first to come to the attention of scientific circles in London.

Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it was a kind of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known."]}, {"page": "Ludlow, Kentucky", "response": ["In 1790, the land that is now Ludlow was given to Gen.

Numerous Britons expressed discontent over a Dutch settler exhibiting an enslaved woman in the country. A British abolitionist society, the African Association, conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. The British abolitionist Zachary Macaulay led the protest, with Hendrik Cesars protesting in response that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: \"has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?\" Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants Charles Byrne and Patrick Cotter O'Brien.Lederman, Muriel and Ingrid Bartsch (2001). The Gender and Science Reader. New York: Routledge, p. 351. Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on 24 November 1810 at the Court of King's Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt \"to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent.\" In support he produced two affidavits in court. The first, from a William Bullock of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show that Baartman had been brought to Britain by individuals who referred to her as if she were property. The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion. Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in Dutch, in which she was fluent, via interpreters. However, the conditions of the interview were stacked against her, in part again because the court focused on the Boer Cesars' involvement in bringing Baartman to London, while largely ignoring Dunlop's role in the affair; it prevented Cesars from being in the room when Baartman made her state, but allowed Dunlop to remain."]}, {"page": "Bullock's oriole", "response": ["Bullock's oriole (Icterus bullockii) is a small New World blackbird.

When the first specimen was sold by the Leverian Museum, it was listed as coming from New Holland (which Australia was called at the time)\u2014perhaps because it was sent from Sydney.

Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus.

The statue was disinterred in 1803, so that Alexander von Humboldt could make drawings and a cast of it, after which it was reburied.
