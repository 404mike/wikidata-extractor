He worked as a design and site engineer in the US and Britain before becoming chief research officer of the highways and transport department of the Greater London Council.  He became director-general of the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive in 1969 where he oversaw the development of plans for the Tyne and Wear Metro. In 1975 he was appointed managing director of the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation.  Ridley was later chief executive of London Underground and a director of engineering consultancy Halcrow Fox. He was president of the Institution of Civil Engineers from March 1995 to November 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "response": ["On 18 December 1956 Harold Gourley died just six weeks after assuming the office in November.  Gourley was the first regularly elected president to die in office (Telford, who was elected president for life, died in office) and the ICE council, who were authorised to fill any vacancy except that of President, were forced to call a Special General Meeting of members.  As a result of this meeting, Sir Frederick Arthur Whitaker was elected to the position in February 1957 and was allowed to serve out the remainder of Gourley's term in addition to his own full term. Subsequent deaths-in-office saw Sir Herbert Manzoni succeed Arthur Hartley in February 1960; and Tony Ridley succeed Edmund Hambly in March 1995."]}, {"page": "Tony Melville Ridley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Ridley"]}, {"page": "Keith Bright", "response": ["In 1987, a major fire at King's Cross Underground station killed 31 people. Following the fire, Bright offered to resign - however Transport Secretary Paul Channon requested Bright to stay as chairman throughout the subsequent public inquiry. During the inquiry, Bright was criticised for suggesting that an arsonist was to blame for the fire. In 1988, the Fennell Report into the fire was published, which revealed serious issues with the safety of the Underground and its management culture. Both Bright and Tony Ridley (Chairman of London Underground) resigned. He was replaced on an caretaker basis by Sir Neil Shields (1988-89), and then by Sir Wilfrid Newton."]}]}}
