These companies provided steamer service to Vancouver, and the Horseshoe Bay - Bowen Island Ferry began in 1921. When the Union Steamship resort closed in the 1960s the island returned to a quiet period of slow growth. In the 1940s and 1950s, the artists' colony called Lieben was a retreat for many famous Canadian authors, artists, and intellectuals including Earle Birney, Alice Munro, Dorothy Livesay, Margaret Laurence, A.J.M. Smith, Jack Shadbolt, Eric Nicol and Malcolm Lowry, who finished his last book, October Ferry to Gabriola, there. In the 1980s, real estate pressures in Vancouver accelerated growth on Bowen and currently the local economy is largely dependent on commuters who work on the mainland in Greater Vancouver. Prior to becoming a municipality, Bowen Island was part of the Sunshine Coast Regional District, made up of small communities and municipalities."]}, {"page": "List of people from British Columbia", "response": ["* Jack Shadbolt, artist"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian painters", "response": ["* Jack Shadbolt (1909\u20131998) painter, war artist and teacher"]}, {"page": "1998 in Canada", "response": ["*November 22 \u2013 Jack Shadbolt, painter (born 1909)"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian artists", "response": ["* Jack Shadbolt (1909\u20131998), painter"]}, {"page": "1909 in Canada", "response": ["*February 4 \u2013 Jack Shadbolt, painter (d.1998)"]}, {"page": "Molson Prize", "response": ["| Jack Shadbolt"]}, {"page": "Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives", "response": ["Artists mentioned in publicity for the gallery include John Anderson, Caroline Armington, Frank Armington, John Armstrong, Carl Beam, George Broomfield, Alex Cameron, Chuck Close, Tom Dean, Mary Dignam, Leonard J.
