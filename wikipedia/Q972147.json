Bastin still scored 17 goals, including six in Arsenal's run to the 1936 FA Cup Final, which they won 1\u20130. After a stint at right half to cover for Jack Crayston, Bastin was eventually restored to the left wing to score 17 goals in the 1937\u201338 title-winning season. An injury to his right leg ruled him out of much of the 1938\u201339 season, the last one played before the outbreak of the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Frank Hill", "response": ["In 1932, he was signed by Herbert Chapman's Arsenal, who had just finished as runners-up in both the First Division and FA Cup. He made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 15 October 1932. At the time, Arsenal were spoilt for wing-halves and Hill competed for his place with Charlie Jones, Bob John, Wilf Copping and Jack Crayston. Despite this, Hill featured in all three of Arsenal's 1933, 1934 and 1935 League title campaigns. He also won the 1934 Charity Shield with the Gunners. Hill usually played at right-half but also deputised at left-half or even on the wing."]}, {"page": "History of Arsenal F.C. (1886\u20131966)", "response": ["George Allison (who had formerly been a director of the club) took over the job of team manager in the summer of 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side, including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping (whose signings had been initiated by Chapman), and striker Ted Drake. With these new signings, Allison oversaw the completion of a hat-trick of League titles in 1934\u201335, and Arsenal were back to their attacking best; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season, and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one-sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930\u201331 season (including 7\u20130 against Wolves, 8\u20131 against Liverpool, and 8\u20130 twice, against Leicester City and Middlesbrough).  Arsenal's strength was such that seven of the players that played for England against World Champions Italy in 1934 were on Arsenal's books; as of 2019 this remains a record number of players from a single club in an England team.  England won 3\u20132 in an aggressive game dubbed the \"Battle of Highbury\".", "Arsenal won their seventh League title in the 1952\u201353 season; in one of the closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2\u20130 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3\u20132, to take the title by 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for 17 years, as the club's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Whittaker in October 1956.  As the club's fortunes declined, they found themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958\u201359 and fifth in both 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table.  Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup\u2014after reaching the final in 1951\u201352, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970\u201371. Rivals Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960\u201361."]}]}}
