This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th\u00a0century. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18th\u00a0century Piers Legh\u00a0XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19th\u00a0century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt's alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden.  Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th\u00a0century.  During the Second World War, the park was used as an RAF lorry depot. In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rd Baron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust. From 1947 the estate was managed by Stockport Corporation and its successor Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council until 1994 when the National Trust took direct control."]}, {"page": "Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton", "response": ["Newton was the son of William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, and Emily Jane Wodehouse, daughter of the Venerable Charles Nourse Wodehouse, Archdeacon of Norwich.

In the 19th-century restoration the 16th-century roof was retained. Richards considers this to be \"the glory of the church\". It is camber beam in type and is richly moulded and decorated with bosses, angels and crows' feet. The memorials include a number to members of the Legh family of Lyme Park, Including Thomas Legh who died in 1857, and to William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, who died in 1898.  There is also a floor memorial to Joseph Watson, the park keeper at Lyme for more than 64\u00a0years, who died in 1753 at the age of 104.  On the parapet of the west gallery are the coat of arms of George IV.  The windows contain medieval glass from the Continent.  The organ was built by Samuel Renn in 1836 and rebuilt in 1882 by Alex Young.  It was renovated in 1949 by Jardine and restored by Church and Company of Stamfordham in 1977.  The organ case of 1836 by Renn is still in place.  There is a ring of six bells, all cast by Thomas Mears II at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1837.

The land was rich in coal and ironstone deposits, and Wilkinson constructed an ironworks (later to become the Brymbo Steelworks) near the Hall. His son occasionally lived at the property after his death,Soldon, N.
