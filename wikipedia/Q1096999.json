This school of thought connected the \"Toltecs\" to the archaeological site of Tula, which was taken to be the Tollan of Aztec myth.{{sfnp|Smith|2007|p= This tradition assumes that much of central Mexico was dominated by a Toltec Empire between the 10th and 12th century AD. The Aztecs referred to several Mexican city states as Tollan,  \"Place of Reeds\", such as \"Tollan Cholollan\". Archaeologist Laurette S\u00e9journ\u00e9, followed by the historian Enrique Florescano, have argued that the \"original\" Tollan was probably Teotihuac\u00e1n. Florescano adds that the Mayan sources refer to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 when talking about the mythical place Zuyua (Tollan).", "Many historicists such as H. B. Nicholson (2001 (1957)) and Nigel Davies (1977) were fully aware that the Aztec chronicles were a mixture of mythical and historical accounts; this led them to try to separate the two by applying a comparative approach to the varying Aztec narratives. For example, they seek to discern between the deity Quetzalcoatl and a Toltec ruler often referred to as Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Nigel Davies"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Nigel Davies (PhD Archaeology), historian of pre-Columbian America and former UK Conservative Party politician"]}, {"page": "Epping (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Nigel Davies"]}, {"page": "Order of the Aztec Eagle", "response": ["* Nigel Davies (1980)", "* Nigel Davies (historian)"]}, {"page": "Latin American studies", "response": ["* Nigel Davies, historian and anthropologist"]}, {"page": "Claude Davies", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nigel Davies (historian)"]}, {"page": "Claude Nigel Byam Davies", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nigel Davies (historian)"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Nigel Davies; MP for Epping (1950\u20131951)"]}, {"page": "Nigel Davies", "response": ["Nigel Davies may refer to:", "*Nigel Davies (historian) (1920\u20132004), British historian and anthropologist", "*Nigel Davies (chess player) (born 1960), English chess grandmaster", "*Nigel Davies (rugby union) (born 1965), Welsh rugby player and coach"]}, {"page": "Joachim Rittstieg", "response": ["In 1975 he read historian Nigel Davies's book The AztecsNigel Davies, The Aztecs (1973).  and learned about the Aztec city of Aztl\u00e1n.
