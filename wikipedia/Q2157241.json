From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz.

Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels.

MacLean, also a noted historian, published two influential papers on nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry in Transactions of the  in 1938 and 1939, which challenged the Celtic Twilight view of Gaelic literature. MacLean accused the \"Celtic Twilightists\" with \"attributing to Gaelic poetry the very opposite of every quality which it actually has\", at which they only succeeded because they catered to a credulous English-speaking audience. He pointed out that the apparent sentimentality or impotence of the corpus of Clearance poetry may have been an artefact of the fact that landlords would not have preserved poetry critical of them. His use of Gaelic poetry as a potential source material for historical studies was extremely innovative at the time.", "In 1940, eight of MacLean's poems were printed in 17 Poems for 6d, along with Scots poems by Robert Garioch.
