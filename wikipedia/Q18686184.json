His name is included in the \"Foyer\u2013Halliwell\u2013Asada\" pathway, a cellular process of hydrogen peroxide metabolism in plants and animals, named for the three principal discoverers, with Christine Foyer and Kozi Asada. He moved to Singapore in 2000, and served as Deputy President (Research and Technology) of the National University of Singapore (2006\u201315), where (as of 2018) he continues to hold a Tan Chin Tuan Centennial professorship.", "Halliwell is known for his work on the control of free radicals in biological systems. His earliest research was in plants, where with Christine Foyer and others in 1976, he discovered the glutathione\u2013ascorbate cycle (also known as the Foyer\u2013Halliwell\u2013Asada pathway) by which chloroplasts remove damaging hydrogen peroxide. He subsequently focused on the role of free radicals in human diseases, demonstrating the toxicity of the hydroxyl radical, a metabolite of superoxide, and investigated the involvement of metal ions, including iron and zinc, in this process, as well as the protective effect of their sequestration. He has also worked on reactive nitrogen species. He developed methods to measure free radical levels in vivo and to quantify the damage they cause to DNA. He has also researched dietary antioxidants."]}, {"page": "CH Foyer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christine Foyer"]}, {"page": "Foyer (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Christine Foyer (born 1952), UK botanist"]}]}}
