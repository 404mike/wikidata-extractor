The family subsequently moved to Hetton-le-Hole, County Durham, where they took part in developing the coalfields. Educated at Repton School, he went on to be the proprietor of a number of mines in the Hetton area, as well as having interests in shipping and other industries. In 1881 he married Edith Florence Jervis of Staffordshire. He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant of County Durham.He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Houghton-le-Spring at the 1886 general election, having contested the seat unsuccessfully in 1885. He was defeated at the 1892 general election. He was believed to have been defeated by the votes of local miners who had been engaged in a lengthy strike and of Irish immigrants due to his opposition to Home Rule. He died from typhoid fever later that year in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London, aged 60. He was buried in the churchyard at Saltwood near Hythe, Kent on 29 December.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Houghton-le-Spring (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Nicholas Wood"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Nicholas Wood"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Wood", "response": ["Nicholas Wood FGS FRS (24 April 1795 \u2013 19 December 1865) was an English colliery and steam locomotive engineer. He helped engineer and design many steps forward in both engineering and mining safety, and helped bring about the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, holding the position of President from its inauguration to his death.", "Nicholas Wood was born at Sourmires, in the parish of Ryton, then in County Durham, the son of Nicholas and Ann (n\u00e9e Laws) Wood. Nicholas Senior was the mining engineer at Crawcrook colliery. Nicholas Junior attended the village school at Crawcrook and started work in 1811 at Killingworth Colliery as an apprentice colliery viewer under the guidance of Ralph Dodds. Wood eventually became the viewer, or colliery manager, of Killingworth Colliery in 1815. He was there a close associate of the colliery enginewright George Stephenson, helping him develop his version of the safety lamp and making considerable technical contributions to the development of his locomotive Bl\u00fccher. Early in their career, George Stephenson began developing a revolutionary safety lamp, yet it was Wood, already an accomplished craftsmen, who made the drawing to which the \"Geordie\" lamp was made, under the supervision of the inventor. It was Nicholas Wood who actually designed the system of actuating the valves of Stephenson's Bl\u00fccher with eccentrics added to the axle; most of the valve gears, including, ironically, the Stephenson Gear, were based on the use of eccentrics, however, not on the simple slip eccentrics of Wood. He also carried out in 1818 a series of experiments on rolling resistance, lubrication and laminated steel springs of locomotives. In 1823 he accompanied Stephenson to the meeting with Edward Pease in Darlington at which Pease was convinced to use locomotives on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and put Stephenson in charge of building it. Wood and Stephenson remained in close contact throughout their lives, and George Stephenson even sent his son, Robert Stephenson, to work as Wood's apprentice, where he flourished.", "In 1844 Wood became a partner in the Hetton Coal Company that owned Hetton Colliery, and moved to Hetton Hall as colliery manager.

Planned to open on 5 August 1871, on the nineteenth anniversary of its foundation, the opening was delayed, owing to the joiners being on strike for four months. The Hall was successfully reopened on 2 July 1872, and was considered by many of the members to be a worthy testimonial to the memory of Nicholas Wood. Within the building, there is a monumental statue of Nicholas Wood presiding over the library, mounted on the top of a throne in the setting of an iconostasis.The Mining Institute Renaissance- Anniversary Celebrations 1852\u2013 2002.
