Edmond documented the house and its interiors in his 1881 book \"La Maison d'un Artiste\". Between 1856 and 1875, the brothers published essays on 18th century art in a collected series called \"L'Art du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle\", which revived appreciation for the Rococo."]}, {"page": "Margaret Craske", "response": ["*, Friderica Derra de Moroda (1956).

Beaumont", "response": ["In 1922, as Cecchetti neared retirement, Beaumont, along with Craske, Friderica Derra de Moroda, Ninette de Valois, Marie Rambert, and others, founded the Cecchetti Society, with the maestro himself as president and his wife as vice-president. Its purpose was to disseminate and monitor the master's style and method of teaching. The Cecchetti Society remained independent until 1924, when it was absorbed into the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, which now oversees the training of dancers in the Cecchetti method in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and South Africa.Claudia Celi, \"Cechetti, Enrico,\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, pp. 81\u201385.", "* Lambranzi, Gregorio.

With Bernhard Paumgartner, a much acclaimed performance of an early opera by Emilio de' Cavalieri was given at the Salzburg Festival. He founded the edition series \"Monuments of Music in Salzburg\" and initiated the recording of several disks with music from Salzburg archives. His research on Salzburg's music history and its lively cultivation was directed not only at Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but also at Johann Michael Haydn, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, Georg Muffat among others. He encouraged the restoration of valuable local instruments (Salzburg Claviorganum, Haydn grand piano) and contributed significantly to the restoration of the organs on the crossing porticoes in Salzburg Cathedral. Through his personal commitment he was able to acquire a number of important collections and estates (Rudolf Gerber, Bernhard Paumgartner, Friderica Derra de Moroda) for the institute. By taking over the Derra de Moroda Dance Archives, an internationally important foundation stone for dance studies was laid."]}, {"page": "Margot Werner", "response": ["Werner began training in ballet at the age of five, with the children's ballet of the Bavarian State Opera, and performed in productions of Hansel and Gretel, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Rosenkavalier. At 16, she was engaged as a ballet dancer with the Bavarian State Ballet, and became their principal dancer, or prima ballerina at the age of 20. She initially trained with Friderica Derra de Moroda at the Salzburg Landestheater and later studied with Margot Fonteyn, Svetlana Beriosova and Beryl Grey, and worked with a number of significant choreographers and conductors in the period, including John Neumeier and Leonard Bernstein. Werner performed frequently with her long-term dance partner, Heinz Bosl, until his death from leukemia at the age of 28."]}]}}
