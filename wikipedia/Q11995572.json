The name came from an aesthetic decision, to stand out visually rather than having a specific meaning.He produces music that could be loosely described as cinematic electronica, but his roots are in dubstep, garage and house. Phaeleh himself describes his music as \"electronic bass music\" with a heavy emphasis on melody and emotional content. His main inspirations are Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, LTJ Bukem, Global Communication and Brian Eno. His compositions are a fusion of live instrumentation and electronic production. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Soma", "response": ["*Soma, a 2021 album by Phaeleh"]}, {"page": "List of UK garage artists", "response": ["* Phaeleh"]}, {"page": "List of bands from Bristol", "response": ["*Phaeleh: multi-instrumentalist, producer and DJ (2008\u2013present).

Several latter-day electronic producers, including Phaeleh, have cited hearing Rave 92 for the first time as the point they became interested in electronic music.", "Other artists who cited Rave 92 as marking a shift in their taste in music include drum and bass producer Kit, citing it alongside the Prodigy's Experience, Rebuild Music founder and UK hardcore producer DJ Thumpa, Viper Recordings artist Insideinfo, Correspondent artist Man Power, promoter and disc jockey Jonna, who was introduced to the Prodigy by the album, and electronic producer Phaeleh, who said that Rave 92 and Nirvana's Nevermind were \"the first two albums [he] genuinely got excited by.\""]}]}}
