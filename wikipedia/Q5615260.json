While still relying on the earlier socio-legal and empirical research, Verdirame's \"The UN and Human Rights: Who Guards the Guardians?\" (2011) offers a predominantly doctrinal analysis of the accountability and responsibility of the UN.\nIn addition to the law of international organisation, Verdirame has written extensively on the use of force, the laws of war, trade and investment, international criminal law, and the philosophy of international law.\nSince 2006, Verdirame has been in practice at the Bar specialising in public international law. His practice includes both commercial  (e.g. investment arbitration) and more mainstream aspects of international law (e.g. inter-state disputes, immunity, human rights). He formed part of the UK Government legal team in Miller v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2017) 'the Article 50 case' at the Supreme Court, and was counsel for the United Kingdom at the International Court of Justice [Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v.
