A lot of these tricks have stemmed from influences by Lewis Crathern and Neil Hilder, who are a part of recently created Team Bosch alongside Hadlow. Many of his new tricks involve an \"ole\" move, where the bar and lines are whipped over head - the first of which was the Bosch Mobe.He is sponsored mainly by Duotone, Red Bull, Chiemsee, and Lost Cause Boards.Hadlow has taken a break from the Professional Kiteboard Riders Association World tour in 2010, he is looking to focus on international promos, and various other events. He also looks to continue his \"on the loose\" series with Ruben Lenten.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Hadlow won the Red Bull King of the Air in Cape Town, South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kiteboarding", "response": ["| Aaron Hadlow || Gisela Pulido", "| Aaron Hadlow || Gisela Pulido", "| Aaron Hadlow || Kristin Boese", "| Aaron Hadlow || Kristin Boese", "| Aaron Hadlow || "]}, {"page": "Laureus World Sports Award for Action Sportsperson of the Year", "response": ["| align=left | Aaron Hadlow () \u2013 kiteboarding Travis Pastrana () \u2013 rallying/motorcycling Kevin Pritchard () \u2013 windsurfing Gisela Pulido () \u2013 kiteboarding Shaun White () \u2013 multi-sport", "| align=left | Daniel Dhers () \u2013 BMX Mick Fanning () \u2013 surfing Stephanie Gilmore () \u2013 surfing Aaron Hadlow () \u2013 kiteboarding Ryan Sheckler () \u2013 skateboarding", "| align=left | Julien Absalon () \u2013 mountain biking Stephanie Gilmore () \u2013 surfing Aaron Hadlow () \u2013 kiteboarding Tanner Hall () \u2013 freeskiing Shaun White () \u2013 multi-sport"]}, {"page": "Hadlow (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Aaron Hadlow (b 1988) British professional kiteboarder"]}, {"page": "Matthew Reeve", "response": ["In 2009 Reeve released Over The Water, a documentary about World Champion kiteboarder Aaron Hadlow, which Reeve filmed, produced and directed over a period of three years.
