He arrived in Melbourne around 1859 and soon moved to Sydney and then to Goulburn, where he worked as a tobacconist and hairdresser. On 23 April 1860 he married Jane Meldrum, with whom he had ten children. In 1876 he purchased St Clair, one of Goulburn's earliest houses, living there until around 1883. He was a Goulburn alderman for 15 years, twice serving as mayor in 1878 and 1880. His wife Jane died on 24 May 1885 and he retired from his business in December 1885. In 1885 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Argyle, which was the county surrounding Goulburn, but not the town itself which was in its own electorate. He stood again in 1887 and was elected as a Free Trade member. Re-elected in 1889, he was defeated in 1891. He was a candidate for Goulburn in 1894, but polled just 6% of the vote.Ball died at Goulburn on 4 November 1894(1894-11-04) (aged 67).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Ball", "response": ["Edward Ball may refer to:", "*Edward Ball (American author) (born 1959), American writer of non-fiction", "*Edward Ball (Australian politician) (1827\u20131894), Australian politician", "*Edward Ball (businessman) (1888\u20131981), manager of the duPont trust and reformer of the Florida East Coast Railway", "*Edward Ball (congressman) (1811\u20131872), U.S. Representative from Ohio", "*Edward Ball (British politician) (1793\u20131865), English MP for Cambridgeshire", "*Edward Ball (cricketer) (1859\u20131917), English cricketer", "*Edward Fitzball (1792\u20131873), English playwright, real name Edward Ball"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1894 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Goulburn || Arthur Barrett || |Leslie Hollis || || Edward Ball (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Edward Joseph Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Ball (Australian politician)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1891 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Argyle || 2 Free Trade || |Edward Graham  Thomas Rose* || |Edward Ball  William Holborow* || || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1889 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Argyle || 2 Free Trade || Solomon Meyer  Thomas Rose || |Edward Ball*  William Holborow* "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1887 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Argyle || Thomas Rose || |Edward Ball*  William Holborow* || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1885 New South Wales colonial election", "response": ["|Argyle || |William Holborow  Francis Tait || Edward Ball"]}, {"page": "St Clair, Goulburn", "response": ["His widow Elizabeth continued to reside there until 1876 when Edward Ball, twice Mayor of Goulburn and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Argyle, bought the residence.
