He was determined to extend his understanding of mathematics and learned German, which enabled him to teach at the Berlitz Language Schools, Elberfeld, Germany, and at branches of the school in Dortmund, M\u00fcnster, Barmen and Cologne, between the years 1901 and 1902. In 1902 he enrolled as a student at Leipzig University, where he obtained a PhD for his research on the photoelectric effect. While studying in Germany he met his future wife, Rose Heathfield, whom he married in 1909.Plain People, Holme St Cuthbert History Group, 2004 His teaching career started in 1906 following his return from Germany, when he became an assistant lecturer in the Wheatstone laboratory in King's College London. During the years spent at King's College, he developed his work and knowledge on the emission of photons from hot bodies. He also continued being interested in the theory of relativity and quantum theory. Thanks to his knowledge of generalised mechanics, he was able to appreciate the consequences of the postulates introduced by Niels Bohr in the quantum theory field. He also explained the atomic orbits of the electrons and, using a generalized version of Bohr quantization, he derived the formula for the eccentricity of an elliptic orbit.Dictionary of National Biography 1901\u20131970 In 1917 he received a doctorate from London University.
