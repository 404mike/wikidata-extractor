He especially admired Mozart, so much so that in his final years, he reportedly declared Mozart as the greatest composer. On 10 January 1896, Brahms conducted the Academic Festival Overture and both piano concertos in Berlin, and during the following celebration, Brahms interrupted Joachim's toast with \"Ganz recht; auf Mozart's Wohl\" (Quite right; here's Mozart's health). Brahms also compared Mozart with Beethoven to the latter's disadvantage, in a letter to Richard Heuberger, in 1896: \"Dissonance, true dissonance as Mozart used it, is not to be found in Beethoven. Look at Idomeneo. Not only is it a marvel, but as Mozart was still quite young and brash when he wrote it, it was a completely new thing. You couldn't commission great music from Beethoven since he created only lesser works on commission\u2014his more conventional pieces, his variations and the like.\" Brahms collected first editions and autographs of Mozart and Haydn's works and edited performing editions. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and, especially, Johann Sebastian Bach. His friends included leading musicologists, and, with Friedrich Chrysander, he edited an edition of the works of Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. Brahms also edited works by C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E. Bach and W.\u00a0F. Bach. He looked to older music for inspiration in the art of counterpoint; the themes of some of his works are modelled on Baroque sources such as Bach's The Art of Fugue in the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 or the same composer's Cantata No. 150 in the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony's finale. Peter Phillips hears affinities between Brahms's rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd. Referring to Byrd's Though Amaryllis dance, Philips remarks that \"the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms's compositional style.\"Phillips, P.

Others have suggested it merely represents the name of a popular tavern (Maison L'Homme Arme) near Du Fay's rooms in Cambrai.Pryer's article on Du Fay in New Oxford Companion to Music, ed Arnold (1983) It may also represent the arming for a new crusade against the Turks.Lockwood in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980) (quoted by Peter Phillips, in notes to 1989 recording of the two Josquin masses) There is ample evidence to indicate that it held special significance for the Order of the Golden Fleece. It is useful to note that the first appearance of the song was exactly contemporaneous with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks (1453), an event which had a huge psychological effect in Europe; composers such as Guillaume Du Fay composed laments for the occasion. Yet another possibility is that all three theories are true, given the feeling of urgency, pervasive in central and northern Europe at the time, in organizing a military opposition to the recently victorious Ottomans.", "* Lockwood in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980) (quoted by Peter Phillips, in notes to 1989 recording of the two Josquin masses)"]}, {"page": "List of early music ensembles", "response": ["* Tallis Scholars (Peter Phillips): a cappella Renaissance music"]}, {"page": "Taverner Consort and Players", "response": ["Parrott's group was formed during the flourishing of the British Early music revival during the 1970s, when orchestras and choirs such as Christopher Hogwood's Academy of Ancient Music, The English Concert under Trevor Pinnock and The Tallis Scholars under Peter Phillips began to emerge, advancing the performance of early Western art music informed by scholarly research and using period instruments."]}, {"page": "Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Padilla", "response": ["*Lamentation for Maundy Thursday on Lamentations of Jeremiah by The Tallis Scholars, dir.
