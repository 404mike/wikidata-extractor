M. Butler and Elizabeth M. Butler, was an English scholar of German, Schr\u00f6der Professor of German at the University of Cambridge from 1945. Her most influential book was The Tyranny of Greece over Germany (1935), in which she wrote that Germany has had \"too much exposure to Ancient Greek literature and art. The result was that the German mind had succumbed to 'the tyranny of an ideal'. The German worship of Ancient Greece had emboldened the Nazis to remake Europe in their image.\" It was controversial in Britain and its translation was banned in Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["In April 1944 Crowley briefly moved to Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, where he was visited by the poet Nancy Cunard, before relocating to Hastings in Sussex, where he took up residence at the Netherwood boarding house. He took a young man named Kenneth Grant as his secretary, paying him in magical teaching rather than wages. He was also introduced to John Symonds, whom he appointed to be his literary executor; Symonds thought little of Crowley, later publishing negative biographies of him. Corresponding with the illusionist Arnold Crowther, it was through him that Crowley was introduced to Gerald Gardner, the future founder of Gardnerian Wicca. They became friends, with Crowley authorising Gardner to revive Britain's ailing O.T.O. Another visitor was Eliza Marian Butler, who interviewed Crowley for her book The Myth of the Magus. Other friends and family also spent time with him, among them Doherty and Crowley's son Aleister Atat\u00fcrk."]}, {"page": "Schr\u00f6der Professor of German", "response": ["* Eliza Marian Butler (1944)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Butler", "response": ["*Eliza Marian Butler (1885\u20131959), English scholar of German"]}, {"page": "The Personal Heresy", "response": ["On 23 July 1939, about two months after the publication of the book, Lewis wrote to Owen Barfield, \"I quite agree that the Personal Heresy is not important--now! But it was rapidly becoming so. I was just in the nick of time . . .\" (Collected Letters, Vol. II, 260). On 12 September 1940 Jack wrote to Eliza Marian Butler, a University of Manchester professor at the time, stating that the kernel of The Personal Heresy was \"Don't attribute superhuman qualities to poetry unless you really believe in a superhuman subject to support them\" (Collected Letters, Vol. II, 443). In a letter of 14 January 1953, Lewis later wrote to Don Calabria, \"The De Imitatione teaches us to 'Mark what is said, not who said it.'\"Collected Letters, Vol. III, 280. By this comment he demonstrates that he held on to this point of view for many years. If the personal heresy had disappeared by 1940, it has come back in our day which has drunk so deeply of what Lewis called \"the poison of subjectivism\" (the title of an essay by Lewis in Christian Reflections, published in Religion in Life, Summer 1943). More than two decades later, Lewis would write (posthumously in 1964), \"Even today there are those (some of them critics) who believe every novel and even every lyric to be autobiographical\" (The Discarded Image, 213).", "* On 12 September 1940, Jack wrote to Eliza Marian Butler, a University of Manchester professor at the time, stating that the kernel of The Personal Heresy was \u201cDon\u2019t attribute superhuman qualities to poetry unless you really believe in a superhuman subject to support them.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Isaline Blew Horner", "response": ["From 1926 to 1959, Horner lived and traveled with her companion \"Elsie,\" Dr. Eliza Marian Butler (18851959).University of Cambridge (2007).Boucher (2007), p. 121.Burford (2005).Watts (2006)."]}, {"page": "E.
