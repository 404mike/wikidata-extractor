He was a fluent follower of the newer art movements and he came to study and appreciate the detailed senses of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was also a diligent student of the renowned artist and critic John Ruskin. A set of coloured page designs to illustrate Tennyson's \"Lady of Shalott\" gained the approval of wood-engraver William James Linton to whom Walter Crane was apprenticed for three years in 1859\u201362. As a wood-engraver he had abundant opportunity for the minute study of the contemporary artists whose work passed through his hands, of Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, as well as Sir John Tenniel, the illustrator of Alice in Wonderland, and Frederick Sandys. He was a student who admired the masters of the Italian Renaissance, however he was more influenced by the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. A further and important element in the development of his talent was the study of Japanese colour-prints, the methods of which he imitated in a series of toy books, which started a new fashion."]}, {"page": "Crane (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Crane (1808-1859), English artist and portrait painter", "* Thomas Crane, 19th. century British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Lucy Crane", "response": ["Crane was born in Liverpool in 1842 as the daughter of the portrait and miniature painter Thomas Crane.
