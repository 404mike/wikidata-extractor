A prolific inventor, he took out over 50 patents between 1897 and 1920, mostly concerning two-stroke engines and road vehicles. Scott was a keen potholer and the second president of the Gritstone club. In July 1923 Scott travelled back to Bradford in his open Scott Sociable wearing wet potholing clothes and contracted pneumonia from which he died.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Two-stroke engine", "response": ["*  The Day-Cock engine is illustrated in:  ; see p. 48.

From these he developed a three-wheel car with two wheels in line and a third one set alongside but slightly behind the other rear wheel, all supported by a triangulated tubular steel frame. Although the layout still resembled that of a motorcycle and sidecar combination, it had wheel steering by rack and pinion. Its power was supplied by the Scott Company's own water-cooled 578\u00a0cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine with drive transmitted through a three-speed gearbox to the offside rear wheel by shaft. There was no reverse gear.

Development of the three-speed Scott Flying Squirrel began in 1922 as the company was in severe debt and faced receivership.  Launched at the 1926 Earls Court motorcycle show, the Flying Squirrel was expensive - nearly twice the cost of a sporting four-stroke motorcycle of the time.  The unique water-cooled circulation used a convection method known as the thermosyphon system. The bottom end block was painted either green or red for racing or road respectively and featured a centrally positioned flywheel, twin inboard main bearings, overhung crankpins and doors to enable ease of access to the engine. The redesigned three-speed gearbox, multi-plate clutch and the repositioned magneto were all significant improvements."]}, {"page": "Alfred Scott", "response": ["*Alfred Angas Scott (1875\u20131923), motorcycle designer, inventor and founder of the Scott Motorcycle Company"]}, {"page": "Scott Trial", "response": ["The Scott Trial began in 1914 when Alfred Angas Scott, inventor and founder of the Scott Motorcycle Company challenged the workers at his factory to ride from the factory in Shipley through the Yorkshire Dales to Burnsall, a riverside village near Grassington.
