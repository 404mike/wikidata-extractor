He was previously the governor of Bombay from 1900 to 1903, as well as a government minister under Lord Salisbury.\nNorthcote was the son of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. He was educated at Eton and Merton College, Oxford, and then worked for the Foreign Office and as private secretary to his father. Northcote was elected to the House of Commons in 1880, and served as Financial Secretary to the War Office (1885\u201386) and Surveyor-General of the Ordnance (1886\u201388) during Lord Salisbury's first and second terms as prime minister. Northcote was made Governor of Bombay in 1900, at which point he was raised to the peerage; he had previously been created a baronet in 1887. He became Governor-General of Australia in 1904, and brought much needed stability to the post \u2013 his two predecessors had both resigned after less than two years in office. Northcote played a relatively active role in politics, due to the unstable three-party system then in place. He served for almost five years, resigning in 1908 following a falling out with Prime Minister Alfred Deakin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1911", "response": ["* September 29\u00a0\u2013 Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote, 3rd Governor-General of Australia (b. 1846)"]}, {"page": "Charles Ollivant", "response": ["* Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote, Governor of Bombay (1900\u20131903)"]}, {"page": "Henry Stafford Northcote", "response": ["#REDIRECTHenry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote"]}, {"page": "Order of the Crown of India", "response": ["*1900: Lady Northcote (wife of Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote, Governor of the Presidency of Bombay, 1900\u20131903)"]}, {"page": "Northcote, Henry Stafford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote"]}, {"page": "Baron Northcote of Exeter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote"]}, {"page": "Geoffry Northcote", "response": ["Northcote was the son of Reverend the Hon.
