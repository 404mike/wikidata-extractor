It is believed that Mrs Lloyd, concerned about the possibility of contracting TB from her neighbours in the sanatorium, decided that she could not remain in residence. As a result, the house was rented out shortly after completion. Mrs Lloyd herself died in 1907, and is buried in Cuddesdon in Oxfordshire. It was then used as by the Rev. Frederic Meyrick-Jones as the site for a \"crammer\" school before being sold to Leicester City Council in 1929. Percy Lloyd lived a nomadic lifestyle after the sale of Home Place. His 'retirement', to the extent that he ever worked, was spent in Italy and the Riviera. He died in 1937 at 2, The Grand Palais, Monte Carlo. He was survived by a son and a daughter."]}, {"page": "Elstree School", "response": ["*Frederic Meyrick-Jones (1867\u20131950), taught at the school from 1894\u201396"]}]}}
