He went to school at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before going on to study history at Queen's University Belfast. He then took a history teacher's job at a school whilst studying for an MA under J. C. Beckett on the topic of radical Presbyterianism in Northern Ireland following the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and why it had changed from an Irish republican to British unionist perspective in the decades following. Following this, he became a lecturer and later reader of Irish political history at Queen's. He married the Queen's English lecturer and they had two children together. He retired early from Queen's in 1990 as a protest against increasing bureaucracy at the university. He died in 2010 in Belfast."]}, {"page": "Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870", "response": ["The historian J. C.
