After one month since joining Reading, but made no appearances for the team so far, Brown joined AFC Bournemouth, to cover for Shaun Cooper, who suffered an injury. After one month with Bournemouth, Brown made a return to Reading. Ahead of a new season, with Reading promoted, Brown suffered an ankle injury, in a friendly match against Bromley on 15 July 2006, which they won and his injury ruled him out for two months. Brown said on his injury and career: \"I am devastated, absolutely gutted. This was going to be the biggest year of my career. But everything happens for a reason and I have to stay really positive and try to come back even stronger and more determined. I have never even had an injury before, so it's a new experience for me. It's about being strong mentally as much as anything. I will be out for around six to eight weeks and then I will need a few weeks after that to get fit.\" However, Brown suffered another set-back injury on his ankle. In January, Brown returned from injury.
