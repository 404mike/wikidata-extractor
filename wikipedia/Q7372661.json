However, he did not play, and Roy Cheetham became the first City player to come on as a substitute three games later.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p398\u2013399. After spending the opening match on the bench, Pardoe was restored to the starting line-up and played every game for the rest of the season. Manchester City won the Second Division by five points, and were promoted to the First Division. Pardoe was still predominantly a forward at this point. He scored 11 goals in 50 appearances, the most productive goalscoring season of his career. Six of these came in September, including braces in consecutive matches, against Carlisle United and Norwich City."]}, {"page": "Portal talk:English football/Did you know", "response": ["*...that footballer Roy Cheetham was the first Manchester City player to be used as a substitute?
