He left school when he was 15 to team with his father in a song-and-dance act for five years. After leaving that act, he briefly worked with his brother in an automobile agency before going into English musical comedy. In 1929, he joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, which was headed by Barry Jackson, and stayed with it for 10 years.Victor appeared in just over 100 films between 1938 and 1966.
