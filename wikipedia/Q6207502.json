Wemyss lost one of his eyes in World War I, but continued to play after the war (games were suspended during the conflict).\nWemyss, together with George St Claire Murray, a rugby enthusiast from the Watsonians club, founded the Co-Optimists invitational rugby club in 1924. This came after an invitation game against Haddington a Club Wemyss had been a founder member of at the age of 17.\nWemyss went on to be successful journalist and commentator, and on the occasion of Haddington's 90th anniversary the Club received a letter from the Bill McLaren stating how much he owed Jock for early tutelage.", "link_mentions": {}}}
