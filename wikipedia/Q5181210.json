This made publicising the serial easier, as national newspapers had been reluctant to print articles about the storylines up to that point. The show also acquired new series producer Stuart Doughty, who wanted the show to feel more up to date. He introduced Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard) and the Hughes family in September 1988 to \"shake up the mix and to act as identification figures\" for newer viewers.Parkin 2002, p.73. Kate Hughes (Sally Knyvette) and her teenage children were \"outsiders\" and not used to country life, which challenged established regulars Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) and Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines). Glenda McKay was cast as Rachel when she was 17. Her brother Craig McKay was cast as Rachel's brother Mark Hughes. When Craig was auditioning for the part, McKay wrote to the producers and asked if they would consider her for the role of Rachel. She told Angela Hagan of the Daily Mirror that she \"couldn't believe it\" when she was later offered an audition, which led to her casting. By October 1997, McKay had become the serial's second longest-serving actress. She recalled that the public's perception of Emmerdale had changed for the better during her time in the show, saying \"When I was younger, I used to feel as if I had to apologise for being in it.
