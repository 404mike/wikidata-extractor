The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,Three Centuries To Concorde, Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, , p.236 worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortices on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack. The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be used deliberately to improve low speed performance."]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Johanna Weber (1910\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "Royal Aircraft Establishment", "response": ["After the end of the First World War, the design and development of aircraft types ended \u2013 although work continued on general research and the development of missiles.

Lift is generated in different ways at supersonic speeds and achieving reasonable lift-to-drag ratios requires the wings to have a very short span. This works well at supersonic speeds, but offers very little lift at low speed. In order to make a design that is able to take off and land on existing runways, either the aircraft would have to use wider wings and lose supersonic cruise economy, have enormous engine power, or be extremely large. A way out of this dilemma was presented in Britain by Johanna Weber and Dietrich K\u00fcchemann around 1955. Their team at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) noticed that delta wings generated large vortexes over the wing when flying at low speeds and high angles of attack (\"alpha\")."]}, {"page": "List of women in mathematics", "response": ["* Johanna Weber (1910\u20132014), German-British mathematician and aerodynamicist, contributed to supersonic aircraft design"]}, {"page": "Frances Bradfield", "response": ["In 1935, Bradfield appeared in the Imperial Calendar and Civil Service list for this year.  Not being an engineer, Bradfield insisted on having Charles Callen as her supporting engineer, in order to ensure that what they did in the wind tunnels was sound engineering-wise.  In March 1939, Bradfield in collaboration with D.L. Ellis presented a paper before the Royal Aeronautical Society on \"The Use of Model Data in Aeroplane Design,\" published in the Women Engineer.  In November 1939, Bradfield was listed as a Senior Scientific Officer at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at RAE Farnborough.  In December 1941, Bradfield was one of the two female Associate Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society doing \"important work\" at RAE Farnborough.  By 1946, when Johanna Weber joined the Low Speed Wind Tunnels division at RAE Farnborough, Bradfield was head of the Low Speed Wind Tunnels Division of the Aerodynamics Department.
