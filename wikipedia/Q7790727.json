The library's specialist areas include items relating to the history of New Zealand and the Pacific, with specific emphasis on the Otago and Southland regions. The Hocken Collections was established in 1910 when Dunedin philanthropist Thomas Hocken donated his entire private collection to the University of Otago. It currently houses over 8,000 linear metres of archives and manuscripts. It is currently situated at the site of the former Otago Co-operative Dairy Company factory on Anzac Avenue, east of the main campus."]}, {"page": "Treaty of Waitangi", "response": ["In 1877, the English-language rough draft of the treaty was published along with photolithographic facsimiles, and the originals were returned to storage. In 1908, historian and bibliographer Thomas Hocken, searching for historical documents, found the treaty papers in the basement of a government building in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents. The papers were restored by the Dominion Museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the Treaty House during the Centenary celebrations. It was possibly the first time the treaty document had been on public display since it was signed. After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with the Public Trustee at Palmerston North by the local member of parliament, who did not tell staff what was in the case. However, as the case was too large to fit in the safe, the treaty documents spent the war at the side of a back corridor in the Public Trust office."]}, {"page": "Otago Daily Times", "response": ["A prospectus was issued in April 1878 with William H.

This collection now forms the basis of the Hocken Collections. Another new wing, named for benefactor Willi Fels was opened in 1930 and today houses the People of the World and Tangata Whenua galleries. A further expansion of the Museum occurred in 1963 when the Centennial Wing was opened to provide additional display space. With all of these separate developments, the Museum had grown to several times its original floor area, resulting in a confusing layout of multiple internally connected wings."]}, {"page": "Woodhouse Grove School", "response": ["* Thomas Hocken (1836\u20131910), collector, bibliographer and researcher"]}, {"page": "1836 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 14 January (in England): Thomas Hocken, collector and bibliographer."]}, {"page": "Thomas Morland Hocken", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Hocken"]}, {"page": "Dunedin Northern Cemetery", "response": ["* Thomas Hocken"]}, {"page": "Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand", "response": ["*Thomas Hocken, botanist and anthropologist"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cass (surveyor)", "response": ["After his wife's death, Cass lived with his step-son, Charles Hood Williams, until his death.
