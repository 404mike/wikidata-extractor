From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works.   Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Sch\u00fctz Choir, Roger Norrington.  Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Sch\u00fctz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess."]}, {"page": "Choir of King's College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Grayston Burgess (choral scholar) \u2013 countertenor"]}, {"page": "The Tights", "response": ["*The cover picture of \"Bad Hearts Cracked It\" features Susie Bateman (daughter of the countertenor Grayston Burgess)."]}, {"page": "Burgess (surname)", "response": ["* Grayston Burgess (1932\u20132019), English countertenor and conductor"]}, {"page": "L'incoronazione di Poppea discography", "response": ["|Ursula Buckel,  Hans-Ulrich Mlelsch,  Eugenia Zareska, Grayston Burgess,  "]}, {"page": "Grayston", "response": ["* Grayston Burgess (born 1932), English countertenor and conductor"]}, {"page": "List of compositions by Michael Tippett", "response": ["| 21 September 1962: London.
