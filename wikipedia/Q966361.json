Delgado has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup, most recently in 2006.\nDelgado holds the all-time male record for playing in consecutive Wimbledon tournaments, playing for the 23rd time in 2014 at the age of 37.His best singles performance at Wimbledon was reaching the second round, on three occasions (1999, 2001 and 2006).\nHe reached the quarter-finals of the President's Cup tournament in Kazakhstan in 2000. In total he has won three singles Challenger Tour titles but as the years passed, he became more predominantly a doubles specialist player where he has had better success winning fifteen challenger Tour titles and making the final of two ATP Tour events both in 2012. He has coached Gilles M\u00fcller and Andy Murray, and is currently coaching Denis Shapovalov.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 21", "response": ["*  1977   \u2013 Jamie Delgado, English tennis player"]}, {"page": "Paradorn Srichaphan", "response": ["| Jamie Delgado   Martin Lee"]}, {"page": "Tim Henman", "response": ["Henman was picked up by the Slater Squad, a group funded by financier Jim Slater, at the age of 11. The main goal of the Slater Squad was to pick and coach young players from the ages of nine or ten, instead of 11 and 12 as the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) did. The original intake for the squad was eight players between the ages of eight and 11. In addition to Tim, the squad consisted of Jamie Delgado, Gary Le Pla, Paul Jessop, James Bailey, Adrian Blackman, James Davidson, Marc Moreso. In the squad, Henman worked on tennis three hours a day: two hours playing tennis and receiving advice from Donald Watt, and the last hour on gymnastics and learning about the game. In contrast to popular belief, Henman was not considered the best of the bunch, and Sue Barker, the British 1976 French Open Women's champion, judged that there was \"nothing particularly special in his game in those days\". She notes, however, that while Henman did not have the natural skills of a tennis player, he was \"a hard worker\". None of his fellow players in the Slater Squad saw Henman as a potential British number one, with most believing Marc Moreso to be the group's brightest hope. Not long after becoming a member of the Slater Squad, Henman was diagnosed with osteochondritis, a bone disease. He was unable to play tennis for six months, and it was two years before he could return to tournaments. Luckily for Henman, Slater kept funding him while he was recuperating, because of insistence from Lloyd who believed in Henman's tennis abilities.", "During his first tour year in 1991, Henman fared badly. He won the first round in the New South Wales Championship against Andrew Turner, 6\u20131, 6\u20133, but lost in the second round to Corrado Borroni 5\u20137, 1\u20136. He was defeated by Australian Michael Hill in the first round of the 1991 Australian Open junior class, 7\u20135, 3\u20136, 5\u20137. At the National Championships the same year, he reached the third round, but was defeated 6\u20131, 6\u20132 by Andrew Richardson. His performance in doubles matches was markedly better. Henman reached the quarter-finals in the New South Wales Championship with Richardson, and won the Midland Bank Junior Championship in doubles with Jamie Delgado, an associate from the Slater Squad days."]}, {"page": "Andy Murray", "response": ["Murray played his first competitive tournament of 2016 at the Australian Open where he was aiming to win his first title there after four runner-up finishes.

However, in a rematch of the previous year final, he was unable to win his first title as he lost in the final to an in-form Novak Djokovic (who won a record-equalling sixth title) in straight sets. He became the second man in the Open Era (after Ivan Lendl) to lose five Grand Slam finals at one event, and the only one not to have won the title.
