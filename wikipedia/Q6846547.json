More photographic material was used and art director Tom Wolsey was important in helping photographers like Terence Donovan and Don McCullin become established. Mike Dempsey said of Wolsey's work: \"The look of the magazine was dynamic in its use of typography, space to breathe and wonderful images.\"Tom Wolsey: My Kind of Town Mike Dempsey, Royal Designer for Industry, 31 July 2013.
