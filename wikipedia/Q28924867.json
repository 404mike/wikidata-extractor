A former member of the Eurosceptic right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP), he was one of its unsuccessful candidates for the South West England constituency in the 2019 European Parliament election.\nDuring the Gamergate controversy, Benjamin promoted the conspiracy theory that feminists were infiltrating video game research groups to influence game development. Since Gamergate, he has focused on promoting Brexit and criticising feminism, Islam, identity politics, and what he views as political correctness in the media and other institutions. Benjamin has been described as politically \"right-wing\" and \"far-right\" by multiple outlets. He denies this description of his politics, instead calling himself a \"classical liberal\". \nIn 2016, in response to politician Jess Phillips's complaint that she frequently received rape threats from men online, Benjamin tweeted to her: \"I wouldn't even rape you.\" Criticism of this comment\u2014and a later remark in which Benjamin said he might rape Phillips but for the fact that \"nobody's got that much beer\"\u2014dominated press coverage of his European Parliament candidacy.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sargon", "response": ["* Carl Benjamin, British political commentator and YouTuber known as Sargon of Akkad"]}, {"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["By April 2019, the British government had agreed an extension to Brexit with the EU until 31 October 2019, which would mean the UK would take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections. Candidates selected by UKIP to run in the election included right-wing YouTube personalities, Carl Benjamin and Mark Meechan. Benjamin had caused controversy by making \"inappropriate\" comments in 2016 about the rape threats to a female Labour MP Jess Phillips, with the UKIP Swindon Branch chair calling for him to be deselected. Videos made by Benjamin in which he used racist terms also caused controversy.  In May, the 2019 United Kingdom local elections saw UKIP lose around 80% of the seats it was defending. The party was criticised for failing \"to capitalise on the collapse of the Conservatives\" by commentators. In the European elections later that month, UKIP received 3.3% of the vote and lost all its remaining seats.", "In June 2018, four political activists known through social media \u2013 Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Meechan, Carl Benjamin, and Milo Yiannopoulos \u2013 joined the party. This was followed by the party gaining around five hundred members.", "In November 2018, Patrick O'Flynn resigned to join the Social Democratic Party in protest over UKIP's move to the \"hard right\", and Louise Bours became an independent MEP. Former leader Nigel Farage quit on 6 December 2018, as did Scottish MEP David Coburn. Another former leader, Paul Nuttall, quit the party the following day, as did London Assembly Member Peter Whittle.Matthew Weaver, \"Ukip resignations plunge party into further turmoil\" , The Guardian, 7 December 2018. Retrieved 31 December 2018. It was reported that Tim Aker had also quietly quit the party earlier in 2018. Julia Reid announced her resignation from UKIP on 8 December 2018, with Jonathan Bullock following the next day. Jill Seymour, Jane Collins and Margot Parker left for the Brexit Party on 15 April 2019, with the first of those three citing the party's current direction and occupation of 'the extreme right of politics' and the second citing Batten's 'sick' defence of Carl Benjamin's rape comments."]}, {"page": "Milkshake", "response": ["The UK police requested that an Edinburgh McDonald's refrain from selling milkshakes on May 17 during a visit by Nigel Farage. This prompted Burger King to tweet in response: \"We're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun.\" Burger King's tweet was later banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, because they felt that it \"condoned the previous anti-social behaviour and encouraged further instances\", and that it was therefore an \"irresponsible\" advertisement. At a separate visit in Newcastle on May 20, Farage had a Five Guys milkshake thrown at him. Carl Benjamin had a total of four milkshakes thrown at him that week. The act of milkshaking is similar to that of egging as a form of protest against political figures."]}]}}
