Considered one of the greatest players to don a Leicester City shirt and once described as the \"best uncapped winger in the world\", the acerbic and quick-witted Cockney is often referred to in Frank Worthington's seminal \"One Hump or Two\": for example, when locally born defender Alan Woollett's dog died manager Jimmy Bloomfield tried to get his players to show respectful sympathy towards the defender \u2014 a feat Glover was singularly unable to do.

Gillies became well known for his ability to spot a good player during his time at Filbert Street bringing through the ranks future FWA Footballer of the Year winners Gordon Banks and Frank McLintock and future PFA Player of the Year Peter Shilton, as well as club favourites Dave Gibson, Lenny Glover and Graham Cross. Leicester reached the FA Cup final twice under the stewardship of Gillies in 1961 and 1963. In 1961, they were on the losing side to double winners Tottenham, and as a result were England's representatives in the 1961\u201362 European Cup Winners' Cup in which Leicester were knocked out by eventual winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the first round. In 1963, Leicester chased the double. The coldest winter for decades meant Leicester were forced to play a backlogged fixture list on ice, then went on a then club-record 18-game unbeaten culminating in the club sitting atop the First Division on 16 April 1963, causing the press to label Leicester as the \"ice kings\". However, injuries (possibly feigned in light of the upcoming FA Cup final) eventually took their toll and Leicester took just one point from their final five games, seeing them fall to fourth position, though this was still the club's best post-war finish up until the 2015\u201316 season, where Leicester won the Premier League.
