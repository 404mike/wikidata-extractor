It shared some components with the Standard Vanguard and had a motor that was based on that of the Standard Ten. Its body was largely inspired by the Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury limousines of the era, most notably the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn, but was much smaller, thus making the design and proportions look rather odd. The body was also rather heavy, which combined with the small motor made the car under powered and slow, reaching a top speed of only 63\u00a0mph. James May called it the ugliest car ever built, saying about it \"Its details are ugly, its overall proportions are ugly, its very concept \u2013 as a car to appeal to Americans who believed they were directly descended from the Pilgrim Fathers \u2013 makes one shudder.\" Stuff.co.nz included in an article on Cars that should never have been built, saying about it: \"It always looked like the misshapen out of scale miniature of the larger, more elegant Renown model, viewed in the distorted reflection of a fairground mirror.\" It was featured in the books \"The Worst Cars Ever Sold\" by Giles Chapman, \"Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons\" by Tony Davis and \"The World's Worst Cars\" by Craig Cheetham, who said that it had \"the appearance of a Rolls-Royce Phantom that had been chopped in the middle.\"", "In the late 1990s, when Renault started manufacturing their new generation of Espace MPV in-house instead of at Matra, the latter company needed a new product to build. Renault chose to create a luxury coupe based on the old Espace. According to Craig Cheetham in his book World's Worst Cars, \"the car was doomed to failure by its very concept.\" Despite being based on the same platform as the Espace minivan, the car was designed for just four people, and rear legroom was disappointing. Retaining the height of an MPV, the car appeared tall and ungainly. The Renault Avantime became one of the biggest sales flops in automotive history. Only 8,557 units sold, making it more rare numerically than some models of Rolls-Royce or Ferrari. Production halted in 2003, when the Matra car production company went bankrupt."]}]}}
