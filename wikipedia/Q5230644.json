Supportive of Johnson's domestic policies, and hoping to preserve his friendship with the President, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson's election victory, Graham's role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher. Graham's biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other President he had ever known."]}, {"page": "Bibliography of George W.

Professor John Shoup has said that in 2018 the Turkish-speaking Syrian Turkmen formed around 4-5% of the population. Professor Taef El-Azhari, Dr. Sebastien Peyrouse, and Dr. Paul Antonopoulos have all stated that there is around 1 million Turkish-speaking Syrian Turkmen. In addition, Dr. Eldad J. Pardo and Maya Jacobi have cited an estimate of 750,000 to 1.5 million. Professor David Aikman has said that there is \"about 1.7 million Turks in Syria\". Dr. Jonathan Spyer, as well as a report published in cooperation between the Norwegian Church Aid and the World Council of Churches (compiled by various academics), stated that the Turkmen number anywhere from 500,000 to 3 million. Professor Pierre Piccinin claims that whilst 1.5 million Syrian Turkmen are Turkish-speaking, the total population of the minority is between 3.5 and 6 million (or 15% to 20% of the population), including those who have adopted Arabic as their mother tongue."]}, {"page": "Tom Freiling", "response": ["In 2004 Charles Sellier's Grizzly Adams Productions used George W.

By the end of August, more than 1,500 had signed, 3,000 by September and 20,000 by November. January 1951 saw the figure go up to 90,000 and April 180,000.; . The campaign ultimately reached 417,389 claimed signatories before the circulation was over, in 1954, amounting to about half of all Chinese Protestants. More than one million additional signatures were gathered after the official circulation had been concluded. The high number of signatures has since been disputed by journalist David Aikman and others. For instance, more Lutherans purportedly signed the document than were in existence in China. It has also been claimed that many names were included without consent. Regardless, the number of signatories can be interpreted in two ways: a relatively high number of signatories testifies to the success of Wu and the campaign to accommodate to the communist government. Conversely, the number of people who did not sign the manifesto count as people who did not want the Chinese Church to sever its links with foreigners. It was feared that the NCC, which had facilitated cooperation between Chinese Protestants and foreign missionaries since 1922, would lose its independence. Most appear to have signed the document out of patriotic sentiments, not because of fundamental agreement with the actual provisions of the manifesto: not all were convinced Marxists. It is also possible that becoming a signatory was initially on a voluntary basis, but after the Korean War had broken out, doing so certainly became a test of loyalty that could not be avoided.; . The war resulted in the campaign rising to an unforeseen level of political urgency, and by early 1951 it had become mingled with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries. Similar intensification affected other government-led campaigns as well. After China's entry into the war, leaders of independent Chinese churches who refused to sign the manifesto began to be persecuted: they lost their churches, pastors were arrested, congregations forced underground, and dissidents were dragged to \"denunciation meetings\" that sometimes could result in imprisonment or execution. Though only a small number of Christians ended up being indicted or executed, the meetings were very humiliating for the dissidents."]}, {"page": "Aikman, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Aikman"]}]}}
