David Sheepshanks became chairman of the club in 1995 taking over a club recently relegated from the Premier League and in financial difficulty. Under George Burley, the club failed in three play-offs before finally winning promotion back to the top flight in 2000 after a 4\u20132 win over Barnsley at Wembley Stadium. Relegation followed two seasons later after a brief spell in Europe and Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. After nearly four seasons, Royle left the club and in June 2006, Sheepshanks appointed former Ipswich player Jim Magilton as the manager of the team. Magilton was sacked nearly three years later after failing to lead the club to either play-offs or promotion. He was succeeded by Roy Keane, who had managed Sunderland to the Championship title two years previously, who became only the club's 13th full-time manager during their 74-year professional status.  He was sacked on 7 January 2011 and was replaced by Ian McParland in a caretaker capacity before Paul Jewell took over as manager on 13 January 2011."]}, {"page": "St George's Park National Football Centre", "response": ["The project's chairman, David Sheepshanks, said: \"Our aim is to make St George's Park a sporting destination of choice for coaches, players, administrators and officials\"."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["Having served on the board of directors since 1986, David Sheepshanks was appointed as club chairman in August 1995.
