Ross had apparently not heard of him before getting involved in soccer, but agreed to finance the transfer when Toye compared the Brazilian's popularity to that of the Pope. Pel\u00e9 joined the Cosmos on June 10, 1975 on a salary of $1.4\u00a0million per year, an enormous wage for an athlete at that time. A number of contracts\u2014only one of which mentioned soccer\u2014were set up for Pel\u00e9 to ensure that he paid the lowest amount of tax possible, including one as a \"recording artist\" with Warner subsidiary Atlantic Records. \"We owned him lock, stock and barrel,\" Toye retrospectively boasted.

The team considered playing its home matches at Verdun Stadium and Jarry Park Stadium before settling on Universite de Montreal Stadium for its home matches. On 9 April 1972, Welsh international and former Leeds and Juventus center forward John Charles signed to play with the Olympiques.  On 6 May 1972, it was announced that Graeme Souness and Mike Dillon had been loaned to the team by the Tottenham Hotspur F.C..  Both players would make ten appearances for Montreal with Dillon scoring seven goals. Italian defender Luigi Mascalaito was also brought over on loan from Verona. All three were released during the season by the team at the players' request.  As well as playing a series of exhibition matches against Canadian semi-pro and lower division teams, during the summer of 1972, the Olympique hosted Aberdeen F.C. from Scotland, Portuguese club CUF Barreiro, and Werder Bremen from West Germany.  The team's match against Aberdeen was halted in the sixty-fifth minute after fans threw objects and invaded the pitch, attempting to attack the Scottish team's players after Joe Harper scored a penalty, giving the Dons a 1-0 lead.  The Olympiques ended the 1972 NASL season in third place of the Northern Division with a record of four wins, five draws and five losses and averaging 2,308 fans a game.  Prior to the final game of the season against the Dallas Tornado, owner Berger announced that the team had reduced its losses by 75% over the previous season.  In February, it was reported the team had lost a combined $400,000 over the 1971 and 1972 seasons. Shortly after the season, Jim Koerner, formally of the St. Louis Stars, was hired as Business and General Manager.
