In 1827, John Hodgson fully rejected the text as spurious on account of its absence from Bertram's papers in Copenhagen, errors in the \"extract\"\u2019s paleography, and the work's highly unusual Latin style. Enough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society declined to include The Description of Britain in its list of important historical works. In 1846, the German scholar Karl Wex conclusively proved at least some passages of the Description were completely spurious. He had been working on a new edition of Tacitus's Agricola and, consulting the Description, he recognized that it included transcription errors which had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the late 15th century. His work was translated into English by Poste and printed by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1846."]}, {"page": "John Horsley (antiquarian)", "response": ["John Hodgson, in a memoir published in 1831, held that Horsley was born in 1685, at Pinkie House, in the parish of Inveresk, Midlothian, and that his father was a Northumberland nonconformist, who had migrated to Scotland, but returned to England soon after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. John Hodgson Hinde, in the Archaeologia Aeliana of February 1865, held that he was a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne, the son of Charles Horsley, a member of the Tailors' Company of the town.

The yew tree indicates an old church, but the present church was built about 1500 in Perpendicular style. There is no division between nave and chancel, and the roof carries a little bell tower. There is an old cross shaft at the west end. In 1883-4 the church was very much restored, and some of the old memorials were destroyed. One, recorded by John Hodgson, requested prayers for the soul of Nicholas Ridley, who died in the fifteenth century (1490). There is a memorial now in the church to the Revd. Anthony Hedley of Chesterholm, friend of Hodgson, who died 17 January 1835, having caught a fatal chill in going out to supervise an excavation at Vindolanda fort.

Wrekenton is believed to have been the meeting point of two Roman roads, Cade's Road and the Wrekendyke Road. Cade's Road ran from the Humber to York and Newcastle, with the Wrekendyke Road branching away to the north east passing close to Jarrow, and ending at the Roman fort and harbour of Arbeia, at South Shields.

Hodgson based his view on evidence which included a stone tablet now in the Great North Museum: Hancock, Newcastle upon Tyne, which had been found in Milecastle 38 on the Wall in the previous century, its significance having been overlooked. The inscription on the tablet, probably made and erected to mark the completion of the milecastle, includes the names of Hadrian and Aulus Platorius Nepos (Governor of Britannia during Hadrian's reign), as well as \"Legio II Augusta\" (Second Augustan Legion). It is now accepted that units of that Roman legion built the section of Hadrian's Wall which includes the milecastle, and they would have automatically included the names of the current emperor and governor on the tablet.Roger J.

Bertram disclosed the existence of the work through his correspondence with the antiquarian William Stukeley by 1748, provided him \"a copy\" which was made available in London by 1749, and published it in Latin in 1757. By this point, his Richard had become conflated with the historical Richard of Cirencester. The text was treated as a legitimate and major source of information on Roman Britain from the 1750s through the 19th century, when it was progressively debunked by John Hodgson, Karl Wex, B. B.

The castle was at first a simple oblong building, defended at ground floor level by loopholes for bowmen, and having an upper floor, presumably entered by an outside wooden stair. Its date might have been either in the reign of John or in that of his successor, Henry III. Later in the thirteenth century, the building (which may have been left unfinished) was completed with the addition of a north-west corner turret and south wing, and its defence was moved from the ground floor to crenellated parapets at roof level; at that point the loopholes no longer needed to be carefully built up, except one which was enlarged to light a chamber with a fireplace. Later a north-east turret was added, the south-west corner was strengthened, and an enclosure made on the south scarp of the castle hill. The building continued in habitation till the sixteenth century or later, as is proved by the helmet, sword point, and 'fairy' tobacco pipes found under the debris of the north-west turret in 1888; however, it had become a ruin before Camden visited it in the reign of James I. The Armstrongs' map shows it as a ruin, and apparently during the eighteenth century the roofless walls collapsed and all visible and easily accessible stones were removed to help build Dally Mill.
