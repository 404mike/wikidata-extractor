He produced many British TV shows including The Two Ronnies, Top of the Pops, and Blind Date. He was for many years a producer for the BBC, and later worked for LWT and as an independent producer. He also had a long association with television hosts Cilla Black and Noel Edmonds.Hurll was the producer of The Late Late Breakfast Show and was criticised for his part in the tragic death of Michael Lush, only discussing the planning of the ill fared stunt over the telephone. At the BBC, he was the producer of The Eurovision Song Contest twice, taking charge of the 1974 contest in Brighton (won by Abba) and again in 1982 in Harrogate.\nHe was the originator of the British Comedy Awards, and for many years produced them, through his company Michael Hurll Television.He died of Parkinson's disease in 2012, aged 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 7", "response": ["*1936 \u2013 Michael Hurll, English director, producer, and screenwriter (d. 2012)"]}, {"page": "Top of the Pops", "response": ["Following the strike, Nash was replaced as executive producer by Michael Hurll, who introduced more of a \"party\" atmosphere to the show, with performances often accompanied by balloons and cheerleaders, and more audible audience noise and cheering. Hurll also laid off the orchestra, as the Musicians' Union was loosening enforcement of the 1966 miming ban.", "By late 1981, Legs & Co (by this time Anita Chellamah had replaced Peters) had become more integrated into the studio audience, rather than performing set-piece routines, as a result of the 'party atmosphere' brought in by Michael Hurll. Also by this time Colby was particularly keen to work once more with male dancers; feeling it time for a change, Legs & Co's stint was ended, and a twenty-member dance troupe (ten male, ten female), named Zoo was created, with a set of performers drawn from the pool of twenty each week. Colby was now credited as \"Dance Director\". Three members of previous troupes, Menhenick, Corpe and Chellamah, made at least one appearance each during the Zoo period.

Upon learning of his death, BBC One controller Peter Fincham said Thompson was \"that rarity in television \u2013 the talented, single-minded, subversive maverick\" and that his death would \"leave a big hole in the comedy world\". Fincham's comments were echoed by BBC Two controller Roly Keating, who stated that \"Harry was a truly independent spirit and one of the funniest people I've ever known\".

Its theme tune was written by Gary Kemp and performed by Spandau Ballet. It was produced and directed by Michael Hurll. Initially, the show struggled in the ratings and seemed unlikely to survive beyond its first series. Original co-host Leni Harper was dismissed after the third show and various revamps took place to bolster the ratings. Eventually, the inclusion of some of the biggest names in the music business as special guests helped raise the profile and ratings for the show."]}, {"page": "Seaside Special", "response": ["Seaside Special was a BBC light entertainment show broadcast from 1975. It was an outside broadcast filmed at a big top in a British seaside resort.  Originally the big top belonged to various circuses (mainly Gerry Cottle's Circus), but in later seasons, the BBC bought its own to be the venue. The programme was developed by producer Michael Hurll. The series was developed after a short-lived, 6 part 'trial' aired on BBC2 in 1973, under the title Show Of The Week: The Young Generation Big Top, starring the dance troupe The Young Generation and hosted by various personalities. The series was broadcast from various Pontin's Holiday Camps around the UK under the Gerry Cottle Big Top. The first show, airing on 6 August 1973, was hosted by Clodagh Rodgers."]}, {"page": "Legs & Co.", "response": ["By 1981, a new producer, Michael Hurll, frequently relegated Legs and Co to backing dancers. Also by this time they were often not used as producers found it easier to use a video than include a routine. By July, the dancers knew their tenure was soon ending. Their last lead performance was on 15 October 1981 to The Tweets' The Birdie Song; and on 29 October they danced behind Haircut 100 during their performance of Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)."]}, {"page": "Step Inside Love", "response": ["In late 1967 Paul McCartney was approached to write the theme by Black and her series producer Michael Hurll.
