A university classics lecturer by profession, he was elected a Member of Parliament in 1945 and became a significant figure among the party's advocates of Zionism. He was a Bevanite on the left of the party, and a long-serving member of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) from 1952.\nCrossman was a Cabinet minister in Harold Wilson's governments of 1964\u20131970, first for Housing, then as Leader of the House of Commons, and then for Social Services. In the early 1970s Crossman was editor of the New Statesman.

At the press conference for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its \"resolute enemy\". Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour's Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring the government of the day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords' powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were \"unnecessary and undesirable\" and that there was no weight in the claim that the Lords could \"check or frustrate the firm intentions\" of the Commons. He claimed that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: \"How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?\" Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked \"what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?\" He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was \"a grand absurdity\", because they would have been chosen \"upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed\". Powell claimed the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: \"It has long been so, and it works\". He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a recent survey of working-class voters that showed that only one-third of them wanted to reform or abolish the House of Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an \"intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain\". Powell deduced from this, \"As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people\u2014the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive\"."]}, {"page": "Harold Wilson", "response": ["Wilson had never made much secret that his support of the left-wing Aneurin Bevan was opportunistic. In early 1954, Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) over Labour's support for the setting-up of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by Richard Crossman, but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.Campbell 1987, p. 289.", "Under the First Wilson Government, subsidies for farmers were increased.Richard Crossman, The diaries of a cabinet minister, Volume 3: Secretary of State for Social Services, 1968\u20131970. Farmers who wished to leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, forty thousand more farmers became eligible for the maximum \u00a31,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous \"disturbance compensation.\"Labour: A Dictionary Of Achievement, published by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, London, S.W.1.

According to Richard Crossman, Bevan hated \"the in-fighting which you have to do in politics.... He wasn't cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet\". In April 1954, Bevan resigned from the Labour parliamentary committee, having been rebuked by Attlee after accusing the Labour leader of surrendering to American pressure over a proposed multi-national defence organisation in Asia and the Pacific. He later said that he had resigned his position to \"call attention to the fact that their movement was in grave crisis\", and stated his belief that he would be have been party chairman by the following year if he had remained. In July of the same year, Bevan announced his intention to stand for election as the Treasurer of the Labour Party against Hugh Gaitskell.

Macmillan built a rapport with US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, then Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean (SACMED), which proved helpful in his career, and Richard Crossman later recalled that Macmillan's \"Greeks in the Roman Empire\" metaphor dated from this time (i.e. that as the US replaced Britain as the world's leading power, British politicians and diplomats should aim to guide her in the same way that Greek slaves and freedmen had advised powerful Romans).Horne 1988, p. 160 Macmillan told Crossman: \"We, my dear Crossman, are the Greeks in the American empire.
