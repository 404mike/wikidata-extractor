Though there is some novelty in his approach, his discursive talent was better suited to The Chace, the work for which he is best remembered. That poem was also only the period's third georgic poem on an English subject, having been preceded by Cyder (1708) by John Philips and Rural Sports (1713) by John Gay. It consists of four cantos, the first of which introduces the subject and covers the management of hounds. The second canto deals with hare hunting and the third with fox hunting, while the fourth covers otter hunting and the breeding and care of hounds. The poem passed through many editions, some of the later including the two poems on country pursuits that followed it. Among the illustrators of the poem have been Thomas Bewick (1796);Online archive Thomas Stothard (1800); John Scott (engravings based on paintings by John Nott Sartorius, 1804);Google Books and Hugh Thomson (1896).Picclick"]}, {"page": "John Scott", "response": ["John Scott may refer to:", "* John Scott (1639\u20131695), English clergyman and devotional writer", "* John Scott (sociologist) (born 1949), British sociologist", "* John Scott (engraver) (1774\u20131827), English engraver", "* John Scott (1849\u20131919), English artist", "* John Scott of Amwell (1730\u20131783), Quaker poet and friend of Samuel Johnson", "* John A.
