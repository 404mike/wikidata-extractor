A large lead group was together at the end of the cycling leg but Jonny Brownlee's brother Alistair Brownlee (Great Britain) broke away on the run to win the gold medal with Spain's Javier G\u00f3mez in second and Jonathan Brownlee in third.

The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, \"If you run this Olympic race ten times, one of the Brownlee brothers will win nine out of ten times. But they won\u2019t win it that 10th time, and you try to be that person to be there to capitalise on it that 10th time.\u201d Among other contenders were Javier G\u00f3mez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.", "The race started at 11:30\u00a0a.m. on 7 August 2012. Richard Varga led early in the swim and held the lead to come out of the water first. His swim leg split time was 16minutes and 56seconds, fourseconds faster than Javier G\u00f3mez and those two; along with both of the Brownlees, Ivan Vasiliev and Alessandro Fabian; formed a lead group of six that had an 11second gap over the rest of the field. At the transition between the running and cycling legs, Jonathan Brownlee was given a 15second penalty for riding his bike before the transition zone. On the ride the race reformed with a 22-man strong group together for the majority of the discipline. Alistair Brownlee, aware of both his superiority in the run leg and the penalty facing his brother, put the hammer down from the very beginning of the run, aiming to crack the rest of the field and create a gap for himself and his brother. The senior Brownlee soon started to run away from the rest of the field with only his brother and G\u00f3mez attempting to follow him. Jonathan Brownlee was dropped from the group at approximately halfway through the run and then Alistair Brownlee dropped G\u00f3mez with  to go. Alistair Brownlee would go on to win the race in a time of onehour, 46minutes and 25seconds, beating G\u00f3mez by 11seconds. Despite having to serve his time penalty at the end of the second-last running lap, the brutal speed of the group of three worked as Jonathan Brownlee held on to the bronze medal position, 20seconds behind G\u00f3mez but 18seconds in front of fourth-placed David Hauss of France.", "Bronze-medallist Jonathan Brownlee collapsed almost immediately after crossing the finish line.
