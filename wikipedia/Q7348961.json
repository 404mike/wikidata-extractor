He was born in Rainham, Essex. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. Pook's first-class career spanned two games for two teams, making his debut in 1988 for Essex and his second appearance, two years later, for Glamorgan, playing against Cambridge and Oxford University respectively.\nPook was on the Essex side which was defeated in the final of the 1986 Bain Dawes Trophy. His Second XI debut came at the age of just eighteen for Essex against Surrey following 3 seasons with the M.C.C. Young Cricketers where he was proud to field as 12th man during an England vs India Test Match. Pook remained in the Essex Second XI team until 1989 and spent a year with Glamorgan but lacked the passion and drive to earn higher honours, he is both proud and honoured to have earned his living with so many fine young cricketers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pook (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Pook (born 1967), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Robert Pook (1990) : N.
