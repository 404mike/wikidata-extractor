The presence of the artist John Faed (1818-1902) at Gatehouse-of-Fleet, just eight miles from Kirkcudbright, and his evident support for the younger generation of Kirkcudbrightshire artists, was a further factor leading to the evolution of an artistic community in Kirkcudbright. The combination of professional experience and career success, coupled with youthful energy, ambition and enthusiasm, led to the establishment of the Kirkcudbrightshire Fine Arts Association in 1886, with John Faed as its President,  and younger artists such as Hornel, Thomas Bromley Blacklock (1863-1903) and William Stewart MacGeorge (1861-1931) on the Committee, together with several older, local amateur painters."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh City Artillery", "response": ["The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular Royal Artillery in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1\u201312.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1\u20134.Spiers, pp. 163\u20138.
