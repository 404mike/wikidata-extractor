He led the club to victory in the 2011 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, defeating Mansfield Town 1\u20130 with a goal from Chris Senior in the last minute of extra time. Following a succession of poor performances at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Cooper and his assistant Richard Dryden were sacked by the club in October. A little more than two months later, Singh placed the club into administration for the third time in less than a decade. A number of players were released and allowed to join other clubs for nominal fees in January before interim manager Craig Liddle and the remaining playing staff had their contracts terminated by Darlington's administrator. Two days later, the club was spared from liquidation after a last-minute injection of funding by supporters' groups. Enough funds were raised for Darlington to complete the season, but relegation was confirmed with three matches remaining."]}, {"page": "Tamworth F.C.", "response": ["Despite a fairly poor 2006\u201307 league campaign, Tamworth once again found themselves at the 3rd round stage of the FA Cup.

They were replaced two days later by the former Tamworth managerial duo of manager Gary Mills and assistant Darron Gee.
