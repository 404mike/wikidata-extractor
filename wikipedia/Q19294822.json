Gold, and fellow hacker Robert Schifreen, were said to have accessed, inter alia, the personal message account of Prince Philip. The facts as outlined in The Hacker's Handbook are that he was 'fitted' up, having tried, repeatedly and unsuccessfully, to warn BT's Prestel via Micronet of the security holes. Gold later became a \"respected information security journalist\".In 1984, Gold and fellow journalist/hacker Robert Schifreen demonstrated an \"ad hoc penetration test\" of a Prestel network which, according to the writer Nick Barron, used \"a combination of clever shoulder surfing and good old-fashioned hacking skills\". An archive telling the story of how the 1980s hack of Prince Philip\u2019s mailbox led to UK anti-hacking legislation is held at The National Museum of Computing in Bletchley.Gold and Schifreen were convicted in 1986, (after a series of pre-'trials') at Southwark Crown Court on a charge of misusing passwords: the actual charge sheet read \"uttering a forgery\", under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. They appealed successfully and were twice acquitted by higher courts on the basis that they had not obtained any material gain from their exploits. The appeals were pursued right up to the House of Lords by BT at taxpayers expense during the Thatcher era. Their case, it has been said, \"led directly to the introduction of the 1990 Computer Misuse Act\". \nGold was 'de facto' author of the fourth edition of The Hacker's Handbook, previous editions of which had been completed by \"Hugo Cornwall\", [now] Professor Peter Sommer.Gold died on 12 January 2015. and is commemorated by webpage Silent Modems created by friends and followers in his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of security hacking incidents", "response": ["* Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold are convicted of accessing the Telecom Gold account belonging to the Duke of Edinburgh under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in the United Kingdom, the first conviction for illegally accessing a computer system.

While at a trade show, Schifreen, by doing what latterly became known as shoulder surfing, had observed the password of a Prestel engineer. The engineer's username was 22222222 and the password used was 1234. This later gave rise to accusations that British Telecom (BT) had not taken security seriously. Armed with this information, the pair explored the system, even gaining access to the personal message box of Prince Philip."]}, {"page": "Steve Gold", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stephen Gold"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2015", "response": ["*Stephen Gold, 58, British computer journalist, complications of heart surgery.1980s hacker turned journo, IT crime ace Steve Gold logs off"]}, {"page": "Gold, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Gold"]}]}}
