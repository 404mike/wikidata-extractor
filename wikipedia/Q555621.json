For the opening season in 1962 he directed two neglected 17th-century English plays, John Fletcher's 1638 comedy The Chances and John Ford's 1633 tragedy The Broken Heart, followed by Uncle Vanya. The company he recruited was forty strong and included Thorndike, Casson, Redgrave, Athene Seyler, John Neville and Plowright. The first two plays were politely received; the Chekhov production attracted rapturous notices. The Times commented, \"It is doubtful if the Moscow Arts Theatre itself could improve on this production.\" The second Chichester season the following year consisted of a revival of Uncle Vanya and two new productions\u2014Shaw's Saint Joan and John Arden's The Workhouse Donkey.

Gotthold Ephraim Lessing defined it as a mixture of emotions in which \"seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure.\"  Tragicomedy's affinity with satire and \"dark\" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced many playwrights including Samuel Beckett and Tom Stoppard.  Also it can be seen in absurdist drama. Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play The Visit (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-World War II British theatre, with authors as varied as Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, John Arden, Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter writing in this genre. Vladimir Nabokov's postmodern fiction Pale Fire is a tragicomedy preoccupied with Elizabethan drama"]}, {"page": "John Bale", "response": ["He is the central figure in the 1988 novel Books of Bale by the novelist and playwright John Arden."]}, {"page": "Angry young men", "response": ["*John Arden"]}, {"page": "James Connolly", "response": ["a 12-hour play on the life and politics of James Connolly written by John Arden and Margaretta D'Arcy.
