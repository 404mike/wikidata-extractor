He played football while in the Army as well as for home-town club Burton Albion, and had a reputation as a \"rough and tumble striker\", by the time Birmingham City signed him on professional forms on 13 November 1947. He was prolific in reserve-team football, scored in first-team friendlies in Scotland and Switzerland, and made his senior debut on 13 November 1948a year to the day after signingstanding in for Cyril Trigg. Ten minutes into the match, at home to Huddersfield Town in the First Division, he injured a leg in a tackle. He played on, in increasing discomfort, went to hospital after the match, and X-rays revealed a broken bone, just above the ankle. He said afterwards, \"I thought it was a bit painful, but had not realised it was as bad as that.\" He missed only four months of the season, but by the time he was fit again, Jimmy Dailey had taken over at centre forward. It was the first instance of what the Sports Argus dubbed \"an unhappy knack of bumping into trouble\". Over the next 18 months, he injured himself tripping on the stairs, twisted his ankle when he trod on a brick, and what he thought was \"just a cold\" had turned into pneumonia that left him hospitalised for weeks. He played just five first-team games for Birmingham, and was transfer-listed at the end of the 1950\u201351 season."]}, {"page": "James Daley", "response": ["*Jimmy Dailey (1927\u20132002), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-nine players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competition, and there were nine different goalscorers.

He made his debut in the 1945\u201346 FA Cup, and contributed 18 goals from 28 league matches in the first post-war league season. Despite such a strong scoring record, Jimmy Dailey and then Clarrie Jordan were preferred in the following campaign. Ward played only seven more times, scoring once, and then returned to the north-east to sign for Third Division North club Darlington at the end of the season. He remained with the club for six years, and played 119 league matches in which he scored 32 goals. Alongside his football career, Ward worked as an undertaker."]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Jimmy Dailey"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Jimmy Dailey"]}]}}
