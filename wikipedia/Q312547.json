He is credited with inventing the turbojet engine. A patent was submitted by Maxime Guillaume in 1921 for a similar invention; however, this was technically unfeasible at the time. Whittle's jet engines were developed some years earlier than those of Germany's Hans von Ohain who designed the first operational turbojet engine.From an early age, Whittle demonstrated an aptitude for engineering and an interest in flying. At first he was turned down by the RAF but, determined to join the force, he overcame his physical limitations and was accepted and sent to No. 2 School of Technical Training to join No 1 Squadron of Cranwell Aircraft Apprentices. He was taught the theory of aircraft engines and gained practical experience in the engineering workshops. His academic and practical abilities as an Aircraft Apprentice earned him a place on the officer training course at Cranwell. He excelled in his studies and became an accomplished pilot. While writing his thesis there he formulated the fundamental concepts that led to the creation of the turbojet engine, taking out a patent on his design in 1930. His performance on an officers' engineering course earned him a place on a further course at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with a First.Without Air Ministry support, he and two retired RAF servicemen formed Power Jets Ltd to build his engine with assistance from the firm of British Thomson-Houston. Despite limited funding, a prototype was created, which first ran in 1937. Official interest was forthcoming following this success, with contracts being placed to develop further engines, but the continuing stress seriously affected Whittle's health, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown in 1940. In 1944 when Power Jets was nationalised he again suffered a nervous breakdown, and resigned from the board in 1946.In 1948, Whittle retired from the RAF and received a knighthood. He joined BOAC as a technical advisor before working as an engineering specialist with Shell, followed by a position with Bristol Aero Engines. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1976 he accepted the position of NAVAIR Research Professor at the United States Naval Academy from 1977 to 1979. In August 1996, Whittle died of lung cancer at his home in Columbia, Maryland. In 2002, Whittle was ranked number 42 in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Sir Frank Whittle ground-tests the first jet engine designed to power an aircraft, at Rugby, England."]}, {"page": "August 9", "response": ["*1996 \u2013 Frank Whittle, English soldier and engineer, invented the jet engine (b. 1907)"]}, {"page": "England", "response": ["Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies.

Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding-up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948.

Ohain was then introduced to Ernst Heinkel, one of the larger aircraft industrialists of the day, who immediately saw the promise of the design. Heinkel had recently purchased the Hirth engine company, and Ohain and his master machinist Max Hahn were set up there as a new division of the Hirth company. They had their first HeS 1 centrifugal engine running by September 1937. Unlike Whittle's design, Ohain used hydrogen as fuel, supplied under external pressure. Their subsequent designs culminated in the gasoline-fuelled HeS 3 of , which was fitted to Heinkel's simple and compact He 178 airframe and flown by Erich Warsitz in the early morning of August 27, 1939, from Rostock-Marienehe aerodrome, an impressively short time for development.

However, the Jumo 004A engine proved unsuitable for full-scale production because of its considerable weight and its high utilization of strategic material (Ni, Co, Mo), which were in short supply. Consequently, the 004B engine was designed to use a minimum amount of strategic materials. All high heat-resistant metal parts, including the combustion chamber, were changed to mild steel (SAE 1010) and were protected only against oxidation by aluminum coating. The total engine represented a design compromise to minimize the use of strategic materials and to simplify manufacture. With the lower-quality steels used in the 004B, the engine required overhaul after just 25 hours for a metallurgical test on the turbine. If it passed the test, the engine was refitted for a further 10 hours of usage, but 35 hours marked the absolute limit for the turbine wheel.CIOS XXIV-6 \"Gas Turbine Development: BMW-Junkers-Daimler-Benz\" London, 1946 p. 24 While BMW's and Junkers' axial compressor turbojet engines were characterised by a sophisticated design that could offer a considerable advantage \u2013 also used in a generalized form for the contemporary American Westinghouse J30 turbojet \u2013 the lack of rare materials for the Jumo 004 design put it at a disadvantage compared to the \"partly axial-flow\" Power Jets W.2/700 turbojet engine which, despite its own largely centrifugal compressor-influenced design, provided (between an operating overhaul interval of 60\u201365 hoursThe Gloster Meteor, 1962 p. 28) an operational life span of 125 hours.

Some acknowledge Coand\u0103 as the discoverer of the Coand\u0103 effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight. In their 1994 book American Aviation, authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coand\u0103's 1910 aircraft was the first jet.Christy & LeRoy (1994), pp. 337\u2013338.", "Citing Carl A. Brown's 1985 A History of Aviation, Tim Brady, the Dean of Aviation at Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University, wrote in 2000: \"the development of the jet is, broadly, the story of three men: Henri Coanda, Sir Frank Whittle, and Pabst von Ohain...\" His description of Coand\u0103's disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor's vent, with the novel detail that the aircraft \"flew for about a thousand feet [300\u00a0m] before crashing into a wall.\"Brady (2000), p. 166. Brady cites Carl A. Brown's A History of Aviation, page 140, as his source. In 1990 at the 24th Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics, one of the papers presented included this sentence: \"It is to Henri Coanda (1886\u20131972), a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight, that space engineering owes\u2014beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine (1905)\u2014the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft, the 'Coanda-1910'.\" In 2007 in his popular book Extreme Aircraft, Ron Miller wrote that the powerplant in the Coand\u0103-1910 was one of the \"earliest attempts\" at a jet engine, but was unsuccessful\u2014it was \"incapable of actual flight\", unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain. The question of the Coand\u0103-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved, supporting Stine's view: \"Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably.\""]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Sir Frank Whittle (1907\u20131996) \u2013 pioneer of the jet engine"]}, {"page": "100 Greatest Britons", "response": ["# Sir Frank Whittle, engineer and inventor.

A replica of his first jet aircraft the Gloster E.28/39 stands in the middle of a roundabout just south of the town as a memorial and a number of papers and documents relating to Whittle's development of the jet engine are displayed at the town's museum.", "On the Greenacres Housing estate in the town there was an estate public house, recently called 'The Sir Frank Whittle' and previously called 'The Balloon'. This building was sold by the brewery to the Co-op who changed the use and structure of the premises to be the new Co-op store in the town. The Co-op Food Store previously located on George Street closed in June 2014 coinciding with the opening of the new store.", "The local secondary schools are Lutterworth High School (for ages 11\u201316) on Woodway Road and Lutterworth College (for ages 11\u201318) on Bitteswell Road, both of which achieve good results in applicable exams. A new Studio School called Sir Frank Whittle Studio School opened in 2015 (for ages 14\u201318) that offers purely vocational courses. In 2019 the Sir Frank Whittle Studio School closed due to a lack of students and minimal further interest."]}]}}
