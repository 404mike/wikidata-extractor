Strong has been described in broadsheet newspaper profiles as a \"compiler of acclaimed mammoth discographies\" and \"a man who knows more about rock music than is healthy for one individual\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Byrds", "response": ["In his book The Great Rock Discography, music researcher Martin C. Strong describes the Byrds' cover of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" as \"a timeless slice of hypnotic, bittersweet pop\" and a record that \"did nothing less than change the course of pop/rock history\". Author and musician Bob Stanley, writing in his 2013 book Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop, has called the Byrds' music \"a phenomenon, a drone, genuinely hair-raising and totally American\"."]}, {"page": "Three Imaginary Boys", "response": ["Chris True of AllMusic retrospectively called the album \"a very strong debut\" and a \"semi-detached bit of late-'70s English pop-punk\". Nitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork likened the album to a \"new wave Wire... [or] Joy Division\" and called it \"as original a record as anything else to spin off from the tail end of punk.\" He also called the album \"spiky post-punk.\" BBC Music critic Simon Morgan said \"Smith was forging his own take on the post-punk zeitgeist,\" while author Martin C. Strong said it \"remains among the Cure's finest work,\" adding that \"their strangely accessible post-punk snippets lent an air of suppressed melancholy.\" The album was also described as \"a collection of melodic but slightly kooky power-pop\" by Chris Gerard of PopMatters."]}, {"page": "Phil Collins", "response": ["According to a 2000 BBC biography of Collins, \"critics sneer at him\" and \"bad publicity also caused problems\", which \"damaged his public profile\". Rock historian Martin C. Strong wrote that Collins \"truly polarised opinion from the start, his ubiquitous smugness and increasingly sterile pop making him a favourite target for critics\". According to Guardian writer Paul Lester, Collins would \"regularly\" call music journalists to take issue with negative reviews. Over time, he came to be personally disliked; in 2009, journalist Mark Lawson told how Collins's media profile had shifted from \"pop's Mr. Nice guy, patron saint of ordinary blokes\", to someone accused of \"blandness, tax exile and ending a marriage by sending a fax\". Collins has rejected accusations of tax avoidance, and despite confirming that some of the divorce-related correspondence between him and second wife, Jill Tavelman, was by fax (a message from Collins regarding access to their daughter was reproduced for the front cover of The Sun in 1993), he states that he did not terminate the marriage in that fashion. Nevertheless, the British media has often repeated the fax claim. Collins has been the victim of scathing remarks in regard to his alleged right-wing political leanings. Caroline Sullivan, a music critic of The Guardian, referred to his cumulative negative publicity in her 2007 article \"I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins\", writing that it was difficult for her to hear his work \"without being riven by distaste for the man himself\".", "Rolling Stone journalist Erik Hedegaard expressed disapproval of the widespread criticism which Collins has received, suggesting that he has been \"unfairly and inexplicably vilified\". Martin C. Strong stated in 2011 that \"the enigmatic and amiable Phil Collins has had his fair share of mockers and critics over the years, although one thing is sure, and that is his dexterity and undeniable talent\". In a piece the following year, titled \"10 Much-Mocked Artists It's Time We Forgave\", New Musical Express critic Anna Conrad said Collins had been portrayed as a \"villain\", and wrote: \"Was the bile really justified?\u00a0... come on, admit it. You've air drummed to 'In the Air Tonight', and loved it.\" The Guardian journalist Dave Simpson wrote a complimentary article in 2013; while acknowledging \"few pop figures have become as successful and yet reviled as Phil Collins\", he argued \"it's about time we recognised Collins's vast influence as one of the godfathers of popular culture\"."]}, {"page": "War (American band)", "response": ["Formed in 1969, War is a musical crossover band that fuses elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, psychedelia, and reggae. According to music writer Colin Larkin, their \"potent fusion of funk, R&B, rock and Latin styles produced a progressive soul sound\", while Martin C. Strong calls them \"one of the fiercest progressive soul combos of the '70s\". Their album The World Is a Ghetto was Billboard's best-selling album of 1973.  The band transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up.  War was subject to many line-up changes over the course of its existence, leaving member Leroy \"Lonnie\" Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up; four other members created a new group called the Lowrider Band."]}, {"page": "More Specials", "response": ["Among retrospective reviews, Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic reflected that the album was \"an intensely satisfying set in its day, even if it wasn't as centered as their debut.\" In Uncut, John Lewis complimented the lyrical \"dread that's more existential than adolescent,\" but felt \"the most interesting development is the sonic shift from monochrome into Technicolor.\" Simon Tucker of Louder Than War agreed that More Specials documents the point \"where the band widen their palette even further with the black and white replaced by rainbow,\" and felt that it was a shame that the album \"signposts what could have been if the band had managed to stay together, but maybe they\u2019d said all they could have as a unit by this time.\" In his review for BBC Music, Nick Reynolds said that the album \"has lots of quality, and is almost a classic,\" while Martin C. Strong of The Great Rock Bible felt the album proved the Specials \"were no one trick pony.\" Less favourable were Trouser Press, who bemoaned the \"more turgid experimental approach.\""]}, {"page": "Decade of Aggression", "response": ["The release was intended to give them time to decide what their next album's style would be.Daniel Bukszpan, Ronnie James Dio.

Their first single, \"Lookin' After No.\u00a01\", came out in August 1977. It reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, the first of a long string of successes. The album The Boomtown Rats was released the following month; it included another single, \"Mary of the 4th Form\". Music journalist Martin C. Strong commented, \"Geldof's moody charisma helped to give the band a distinct identity\"."]}]}}
