The devolution movement came to a head in the 1970s, and resulted in a Royal Commission on the Constitution, leading to the Scotland Act 1978. This would have established an autonomous Scottish Executive with a leader termed 'First Secretary', a post for which Strathclyde political leader Geoff Shaw was widely expected to be chosen, though Shaw's premature death and a failure in a follow-up referendum, led to the Act not being implemented, and a twenty-year wait for the Scotland Act 1998."]}, {"page": "Strathclyde", "response": ["The regional administrative headquarters was in the city of Glasgow, and politics were by and large dominated by the Labour Party.
