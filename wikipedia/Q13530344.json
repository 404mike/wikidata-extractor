In \"Observations on the Doings in Lewes of the 5th November 1846\", printed anonymously in the Sussex Weekly Advertiser, called for the working class to be oppressed and the Bonfire Boys locked-up. The tory press, particularly The Express Newspapers suggested to compromise on free speech that the festivities be moved to a site out of town. The Bonfire Boys refused to negotiate with the authorities and pledged to continue their protests. In the middle of the night before the following 5 November a confrontation between some Bonfire Boys rebel rousers and the local constabulary showed they were woefully outnumbered for what everyone thought was going to be the biggest and most riotous Bonfire night yet. The Lewes Police called-in re-enforcements from London and by the next day a Police line surrounded County Hall. There was a long stand-off and by nightfall mock battle commenced with fireworks being thrown and the Police pushing back the crowds. The magistrate and local landowner Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester read the Riot Act on the steps of County Hall behind the Police line and the Police dispersed the crowds with violence. The next morning was eerily quiet but the Bonfire Boys were buoyed by being undefeated in taking on the London Police. That night the Bonfire Boys celebrated back on the streets of Lewes and similar Bonfire festivities spread to other places across East Sussex for the rest of November. So local Bonfire societies were born. The enemies of the uprising such as the Police, Courts and Sussex Advertiser were targeted for intimidation. In a prophetic report and with contrition the paper noted that 'it shouldn't be ordinarily termed a riot, but is the keeping up of tradition'. As proposed by the Express and to keep the tradition burning strong it was agreed by all in 1848 that Wallands Park become the site of the festivities."]}, {"page": "Church Mission Society", "response": ["* Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester (1834\u20131886)"]}, {"page": "John Pelham (bishop)", "response": ["He was the third son of Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester and his wife Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana Osborne, eldest daughter of Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds.

In the same year Union Road was built to connect the Ditchling and Lewes Roads, marking the northern edge of the Level, and the land to the north of it was sold. Local entrepreneur James Ireland established the Royal Gardens on this section, but the venture failed and the land was later sold again; Park Crescent was built on it from 1849. Also in 1822, the Level itself was designed and laid out by architect Amon Henry Wilds and horticulturist Henry Phillips. The elm trees, a gift to the town from Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester, were planted in November 1844. Many were uprooted in the Great Storm of 1987, although at the time Brighton Borough Council was considering felling many of them because of an outbreak of Dutch elm disease."]}]}}
