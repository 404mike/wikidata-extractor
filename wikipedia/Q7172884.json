He made a scoring debut, netting twice in his first senior appearance. His performances with Grimsby earned him the \"Supporters Player of the Season\" for the 2009\u201310 season and he scored 15 goals in 153 league appearances, scoring two senior hat-tricks and playing in three different positions. Whilst with The Mariners, he was briefly loaned out to York City before joining Harrogate Town after leaving Grimsby in June 2011. In January 2012, he signed for Lincoln City but was released after spending nearly a year with The Imps and briefly joined Gateshead.

He made his debut on 19 July in a pre-season friendly against Oldham Athletic at Blundell Park, and went on to score his first goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Morecambe in the FA Cup. By this time Grimsby were under new stewardship following the sacking of Buckley in September 2008, with the club bringing in Mike Newell as his replacement. Following an injury spell in mid season, Stockdale remained on the sidelines for several months while his position was covered by Jamie Clarke. He managed a return to the first team in the closing months of the season and cemented his place at right back, eventually helping The Mariners stave off the threat of relegation from the Football League. During the 2009\u20132010 season Stockdale suffered a hernia injury that kept him sidelined again for several months and would only see him compete 9 times during that season in which right sided attacking midfielder Peter Bore was deployed as the club's first choice right back which would eventually see him be awarded the \"Fans Player of the Season\". Grimsby suffered relegation from the Football League in May 2010 and a month later Stockdale signed a new contract to keep him at Blundell Park for a further season but in the contract was the introduction of Stockdale as the new youth team manager as well as continuing to make himself available for selection as a player. Grimsby manager Neil Woods handed Stockdale the number 39 shirt for the 2010\u20132011 Conference National season as cover for Bore and Bradley Wood.

The club had not appointed a new youth team boss since promoting Neil Woods to first team manager following the sacking of Mike Newell in November 2009. Stockdale was kept on the playing records as well for the 2010\u201311 season and was handed a squad number to be used as cover for Peter Bore, Bradley Wood and Dwayne Samuels who were the club's other contracted players who are capable of playing in Stockdale's position."]}, {"page": "Nathan Jarman", "response": ["He managed to score his first senior goal in a Football League Trophy tie at Chesterfield on 3 September 2008.

In stepped Mike Newell as his replacement, and despite Grimsby's ongoing poor luck in the League, Jarman soon found himself a first team regular, this was mainly down to the release of want-away striker Martin Butler and on-going fitness problems with Danny North. This enabled Nathan to hold down a regular place in the first team squad, partnering fellow youngster Peter Bore up front for several weeks. Nathan scored his first league goal for Grimsby in the club's 2\u20130 away win over his former club Bury. This was The Mariners first league victory of the season. Jarman continued to feature in the first team, but due to the arrivals of new strikers Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro, Adam Proudlock and Barry Conlon, Jarman found himself relegated back to the bench, before Newell moved him on to the right side of midfield, a position which had become his regular position in the first team during the run in of the 2008\u201309 season."]}, {"page": "Matthew Humberstone School", "response": ["* Peter Bore, born 4 November 1987 at Grimsby, footballer"]}, {"page": "Neil Woods", "response": ["In 2003 Woods was appointed Youth Team manager at Grimsby Town, after Paul Wilkinson left the position to move to Cardiff City.
