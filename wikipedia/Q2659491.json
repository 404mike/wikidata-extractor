He was educated at Uppingham School and in 1899 was playing club cricket for the Incogniti. He also played for Sheffield Collegiate and Barnsley and captained the Yorkshire second team. He joined Derbyshire in the 1909 season, making his debut against Warwickshire when he was not out at the end of a drawn match. He played a full season and in his second match against Warwickshire made his top score of 198. In 1910 he was appointed captain and, again against Warwickshire, he made 165 while putting on 283 for the ninth wicket with Arnold Warren. In 2012 this remained the world record for a ninth-wicket partnership in first-class cricket. Chapman was captain of Derbyshire again in 1911 and 1912. He achieved a batting average of over 30 in the 1911 season, but this was down to 8 in the 1912 Season. He played regularly in the 1913 and 1914 seasons, and also after World War I in 1919.\nChapman took the captaincy again for the disastrous 1920 season, when Derbyshire failed to win a match and he gave up county cricket at the end of the season.\nChapman was described as \"An attractive batsman and excellent cover-point\". He was a right-hand batsman and played 210 innings in 113 first-class matches with an average of 18.58 and a top score of 198. He took one first-class wicket at the cost of 241 runs.Chapman died at Carlecotes, Dunford Bridge, Yorkshire at the age of 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Chapman", "response": ["John Chapman may refer to:", "*John Chapman (Leicester MP) represented Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Sir John Chapman, 2nd Baronet (c. 1710\u20131781), British Member of Parliament for Taunton, 1741\u20131747", "*John Chapman (1810\u20131877), British Member of Parliament for Grimsby, 1862\u20131865 and 1874\u20131877", "*John Chapman (congressman) (1740\u20131800), United States Representative from Pennsylvania", "*John Chapman Andrew (1822\u20131907), Member of Parliament in New Zealand", "*John Chapman (Australian politician) (1879\u20131931), Australian Senator", "*John Chapman (theologian) (1704\u20131784), English cleric and scholar", "*John Chapman (engineer) (1801\u20131854), English political and economic writer", "*John Chapman (screenwriter) (1927\u20132001), English playwright and screenwriter", "*John Chapman (baseball) (1899\u20131953), former shortstop", "*John Chapman (cricketer, born 1877) (1877\u20131956), English cricketer", "*John Chapman (cricketer, born 1814) (1814\u20131896), English cricketer", "*John Chapman (New Zealand cricketer) (1865-1949), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Chapman (football manager) (1882\u20131948), footballer and manager", "*John Chapman (rugby league), Australian rugby league player", "*John Chapman (harness racing) (1928\u20131980), Canadian driver", "*John Chapman (priest) (1865\u20131933), British priest, abbot, and religious scholar", "*John Chapman (evangelist) (1930\u20132012), Australian evangelist", "*John Chapman (bishop), Anglican bishop in Canada", "*Johnny Appleseed (John Chapman, 1774\u20131845), pioneer nurseryman and missionary", "*John Chapman (publisher) (1821\u20131894), publisher of the Westminster Review", "*John Chapman (Medal of Honor) (1844\u20131905), French soldier who fought in the American Civil War", "*John Chapman (general) (1896\u20131963), Australian Army general of WWII", "*John Chapman (artist) (born 1946), British artist", "*John Chapman (producer), British television producer"]}, {"page": "Partnership (cricket)", "response": ["|John Chapman and Arnold Warren"]}, {"page": "Blackwell, Bolsover", "response": ["In 1910 the highest ever ninth-wicket partnership in first-class cricket was scored by John Chapman and Arnold Warren batting for Derbyshire against Warwickshire.
