Taylor was previously the youth coach at Exeter City and was also brother to former Torquay defender Craig Taylor.  With Taylor on board, Ling now looked to bring new players to Torquay.  Firstly, Joe Oastler signed a permanent two-year deal with Torquay after being released by QPR, while Danny Stevens also agreed in principle to renew his contract.  Another familiar face who returned to Torquay was Chris McPhee.  He had played for the Gulls during their disastrous 2006\u201307 season and was looking to make amends on his return to the club.  Joining on the same day as McPhee was Daniel Leadbitter, a promising young defender who had just been released by Newcastle United.", "|Daniel Leadbitter"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["*6 June 2011: New contracts are offered to Michael Richardson and Ryan Donaldson, but Paddy McLaughlin, Daniel Leadbitter, Matthew Grieve and Aaron Spear are released at the end of the season.", "|  Daniel Leadbitter"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["Following the acquisitions in June of Joe Oastler, Chris McPhee and Daniel Leadbitter, Martin Ling further bolstered the Torquay United squad with two crucial defensive signings in goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik and centre back Brian Saah. Olejnik came with a fine pedigree having played for Falkirk in the Scottish Premier League while Saah had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient and Cambridge United.  With Chris Zebroski making the decision to follow former manager Paul Buckle to Bristol Rovers, Ling needed to improve his attacking options which led to the signings of strikers Rene Howe and Taiwo Atieno and midfielder Ian Morris.
