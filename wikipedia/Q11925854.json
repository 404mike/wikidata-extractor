Raven's report to the council of Trinity College states: \"In the interests not only of truth but also of the reputation of British science it is essential somehow to discover what plants and what insects he (Heslop Harrison) has either completely fabricated or else deliberately introduced into the Hebrides.\""]}, {"page": "J.
