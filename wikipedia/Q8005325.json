Hearing his wounded comrades asking for water, he went forward, under a heavy fire, to a spruit held by Boers about 500 yards ahead of the gun, and brought back a kettle full of water. In going and returning he had to pass within 100 yards of some rocks also held by Boers, and the kettle which he was carrying was hit by several bullets.\nHe later achieved the rank of corporal. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum at Nottingham Castle, England.", "link_mentions": {}}}
