This form, which Zvelebil calls \"a marvel of brevity and condensation,\" is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators. Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, Herbert Arthur Popley observes, \"it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original.\" After translating a good portion of the Kural text, Karl Graul stated, \u201cNo translation can convey any idea of its charming effect. It is truly an apple of gold in a net-work of silver.\u201d Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form."]}, {"page": "Tirukkural translations into English", "response": ["|13||1931||Herbert Arthur Popley||The Sacred Kural or The Tamil Veda of Tiruvalluvar||Calcutta (The Heritage of India Series)||Verse||Selections||Reprint in 1958 by YMCA Publishing House (Calcutta)"]}, {"page": "H.
