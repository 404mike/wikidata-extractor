The work, in which Webster argued that abuse scandals could be phenomena created by public hysteria, received praise from British journalists. Peter Wilby calls The Secret of Bryn Estyn \"exhaustively researched\", noting that while it was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, it went largely unnoticed by the British press. Wilby writes that Webster compares modern scandals of mass abuse to the witch-hunts of the Middle Ages. Journalist Catherine Bennett credits Webster with exposing \"the hysteria and false accusations generated by the Bryn Estyn children's home investigations\", and writes that in his view the uncritical press reports about the issue demonstrate \"the insatiable human appetite for narratives of evil\"."]}, {"page": "Courage: Eight Portraits", "response": ["Courage: Eight Portraits received mixed reviews on publication.

In The Guardian, Mark Lawson noted that \"it's striking that Barlow's view \u2013 that public value should make private conduct irrelevant \u2013 is one the writer has continued to embrace through domestic troubles.\" He noted the anti-French and anti-American tone, and pointed out the use of offensive language: \"references to 'Islamic headcases' and 'Islamic nutcases'. Arabs are casually noted to have 'hook noses' and 'slanty eyes'; a mixed-race Briton is called 'coffee-coloured'; and there are mentions of 'pikeys' and people who are 'half-caste'.\" Sexist content was also noted. More sinister was that \"the suggestion \u2013 from both an external observer, and the protagonist's inner voice \u2013 that Barlow  may be a fraud. His assistant worries that, under the jaunty vaudeville act, there are no real core ideals, values or beliefs.\" The novel was also criticised for depicting Jews as \"controlling the media\" and being able to \"fiddle\" elections, an evidently antisemitic trope. During the 2019 general election campaign, Catherine Bennett similarly argued that the novel \"amounts to a compelling case for character reappraisal\" and that its perceived tendency to evaluate women's worth \"according to their fuckability on the \u2013 sometimes eccentric \u2013 Johnson scale\" indicates a lack of \"interest in addressing, for instance, sex discrimination, harassment, [or] the gender pay gap\"."]}, {"page": "Don't Look Up", "response": ["Nathan J.
