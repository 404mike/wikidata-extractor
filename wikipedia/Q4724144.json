He was successful in his early career, even painting a portrait of Princess Victoria in 1834. However, he was not satisfied with mere money-making portraits and illustrations. His early sketches predict his later interest in larger historical subjects with challenging moral themes and complex compositions. His early subjects were romantic, and many are taken from Venetian history. His work exhibited at the British Institution and the Royal Society of British Artists had titles such as: The Plain Gold Ring (1832), A Lady Watching the Stars (1834) and Guilt and Innocence (1834).Algernon Graves, The British Institution 1806\u20131867, London, George Bell and Sons, 1908.

The work became a popular engraving.Hilary Guise, Great Victorian Engravings, Astragal, 1980.
