She claims to be distantly related to actress Meryl Streep, through her mother. She is a descendant of 19th-century artist Thomas Bewick.In her teens Bewick started studying at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, and after graduation, moved to London. During her time there she illustrated a children's animated television series for the BBC, and also produced illustrations for books and magazines. On her return to Dublin she took jobs in singing and acting, and in 1957 opened her first exhibition there.She married her husband Pat in 1963, and gave birth to two daughters, Poppy and Holly. During the 1970s, she got to know folk singer Luke Kelly in Dublin and had a sexual affair with him. She had another affair with a local man during a stay with her daughters in Samoa in 1989; when she returned she discovered Pat was also having an affair, which she accepted. By 2015, Pat had contracted Alzheimer's disease.A prolific artist, Bewick paints in oil, sculpts, and works with cloth, but is most associated with watercolours. For the last decade or so she has been working on her Yellow Man project, a large collection of works featuring a cartoon-like yellow horned figure. In 2006 she donated a collection of 200 works including tapestries, wall hangings, watercolours and sketches to the state, now on permanent display in the Walton Building at the Waterford Institute of Technology, and in the Killorglin Library, Co. Kerry.During Bewick's career she has illustrated several books and published several books of prints of her paintings. In 2015, at 80 years of age, she published her memoir \"80: A Memoir\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Irish artists", "response": ["*Pauline Bewick (born 1935) \u2013 artist"]}, {"page": "1935 in Ireland", "response": ["*:*Pauline Bewick, artist (born in England)."]}, {"page": "Bewick (surname)", "response": ["* Pauline Bewick (born 1935), Irish artist"]}, {"page": "Pauline (given name)", "response": ["*Pauline Bewick (b. 1935), Irish artist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Northumberland", "response": ["* Pauline Bewick (born 1935), watercolour painter"]}, {"page": "List of Irish painters", "response": ["* Pauline Bewick (born 1935)"]}, {"page": "List of members of Aosd\u00e1na", "response": ["|\tPauline Bewick"]}, {"page": "Philip and Barry Castle", "response": ["Barry attended Dublin Art School at the tender age of 15 \"because I wouldn't go to school\"  but left after only two years, not really painting again until she was encouraged and taught by Philip Castle.
