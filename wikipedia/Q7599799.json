In March 1952 he moved to Leicester City where he won a second division medal in 1953-54. Despite being a good club servant Milburn's time at Filbert Street is remembered as much for a unique occurrence when he and defensive partner Jack Froggatt both mishit a clearance simultaneously, thus registering the Football League's only occurrence of an own goal credited to two different players. He moved to Rochdale in January 1959 and earned a testimonial at the club, creating another unique achievement by being awarded this honour at all three of his league clubs. Milburn also guested for Gloucester City in 1955.Following his retirement he settled in Rochdale where he worked as a warehouseman.He died on 30 July 2010 at the age of 83.
