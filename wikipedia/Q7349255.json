From 1955 to 1964, he was a clerk of the House of Commons. During this time, he wrote a number of biographical and historical books. He then moved to academia, having been elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1965. He was Director of the Institute for the Study of International Organisation at the University of Sussex (1968\u20131973), and then Principal Officer in the Executive Office of the Secretary General of the United Nations (1973\u20131976). He moved out from behind the scenes when he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridge in the 1976 by-election. He spent most of his parliamentary career on the backbenches, apart from serving as a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Foreign Office (1979\u20131982). He was knighted in 1991, before stepping down as an MP in the following year. During his time as an MP, he continued to author multiple books, and maintained his academic standing through visiting professorships and his Oxford fellowship. From 1991, until his death, he was a Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["Since 1959 Jenkins had been working on a biography of the Liberal Prime Minister, H.

It is frequently thought to have been conceived at Eton. The author Robert Rhodes James in his biography of Rosebery (published in 1995, ) has argued that it is apocryphal. McKinstry (p. 540) considers that if it was conceived by Rosebery, he probably told it to Samuel Ward, the American political lobbyist, at a meeting of the Mendacious Club during the 1870s.
