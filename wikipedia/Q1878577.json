His stay at Cambridge was happier and more fruitful; after his Oxford experiences he took care to avoid being publicly associated with anything that was scandalous or blasphemous. Among his closest Cambridge friends was the future essayist and novelist Llewelyn Powys, whose elder brother, Theodore, Wilkinson had known in his Aldeburgh schooldays.   ", "In America, Powys introduced Wilkinson to Frances Gregg. She was an established figure on the avant-garde American literary scene, mixing with among others Ezra Pound and \"H.D.\" (Hilda Doolittle), the latter having been for a time her lover. Powys was deeply in love with Gregg, but being married and unwilling to divorce, could not himself pursue matters with her. Instead, in April 1912 Gregg married Wilkinson, causing Powys much long-term jealousy. The unconventional newlyweds invited H.D. to join them on their honeymoon in Venice; she accepted, and prepared to go, but was eventually persuaded otherwise by Pound. The honeymoon was nevertheless eccentric, as the couple were joined in Venice by John Cowper and Llewelyn Powys, where the four behaved, according to one writer, so scandalously that they were arrested, and almost thrown out of the city.", "After Welsh Ambassadors, Wilkinson was a regular visitor to the Swiss sanatorium where Llewelyn Powys, his closest friend among the brothers, was slowly succumbing to tuberculosis \u2013 he died in December 1939.  Wilkinson wrote nothing of substance in this period; after his friend's death, he edited The Letters of Llewelyn Powys, which was published in 1943. In 1944 Wilkinson produced his single venture into the science-fiction genre, The Devil in Crystal, described by The Observers Alan Pryce-Jones as \"an odd little fantasy\", in which the protagonist, through a warp in time, is able to relive a part of his past life. In 1946, Wilkinson wrote his last full-length novel, Forth, Beast, a sequel to  Swan's Milk, in which he reprised his Dexter Foothood persona.
