This is a tower built in the Sabaean style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in South Arabia to around 700 BC. Although no radiocarbon dating testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions.David W. Phillipson, Ancient Churches of Ethiopia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), p. 36 David Phillipson attributes its \"excellent preservation\" to two factors, \"the care with which its original builders ensured a level   foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century  AD -- for use as a Christian church.\" Two other archaeological sites at Yeha include Grat Beal Gebri, a ruined complex distinguished by a portico 10 meters wide and two sets of square pillars, and a graveyard containing several rock-hewn shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial, while another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.Phillipson, Ancient Churches, pp. 32, 37"]}, {"page": "Lalibela", "response": ["There is some controversy as to when some of the churches were constructed.

However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about 100\u00a0km south of Addis Ababa. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous King Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.David Keys: Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?"]}, {"page": "Agula", "response": ["Agula was visited by the Portuguese priest Francisco \u00c1lvares on 13 August 1520, who called it Anguguim.
