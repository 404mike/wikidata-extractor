The land was inclosed by a pale, whence it was called a park, and is marked as such in Norden and Speed's map of 1610. This grant was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth, but as Heath was later deprived for refusing the statutory oaths, the nominal ownership was conveyed to his brother William in 1564.  The former archbishop continued, however, to reside when his nephew Thomas forfeited his new lands in 1588. Later they were restored, and in 1606 sold to Francis Leigh. The Cope, Hale and Henn families held the lands until 1681. The Martin and Crawley families held them until the time when Mr Revel, M.P. 1734\u201352, is said to have been the owner. In 1758, his daughter and heiress married Sir George Warren, and in 1777 their daughter married Thomas Bulkeley, 7th Viscount Bulkeley. The latter died in 1822, leaving the land to Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet, after which now reduced in area, it was acquired by the Le Marchant baronets."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire", "response": ["*Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet 7 March 1851 \u2013 14 September 1866"]}, {"page": "Richard Williams-Bulkeley", "response": ["*Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet (1801\u20131875)"]}, {"page": "Sir Richard Bulkeley Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet"]}]}}
