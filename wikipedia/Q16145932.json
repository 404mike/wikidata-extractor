Gabrels told Buckley: \"It was never said to me that it had been rejected for want of commercial material. I just thought the decision was made that [Leon] would have been insane to put out from a commercial point of view...and that we needed to rerecord some more songs.\" As such, Bowie elected to record some more conventional tracks, for which sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City from January to February 1995. Songs recorded in New York included the title track, \"Thru These Architects Eyes\", \"We Prick You\", \"I Have Not Been to Oxford Town\", \"No Control\", a rerecording of the Buddha track \"Strangers When We Meet\", and reworkings of \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and \"I'm Deranged\". New additions to the lineup included guitarist Carlos Alomar, Bowie's former bandleader who was fired following the 1987 Glass Spider Tour; Tin Machine contributor Kevin Armstrong on \"Thru These Architects Eyes\"; and jazz drummer Joey Baron, whom Bowie felt was \"so steady\" that \"metronomes shake in fear\". Armstrong's song \"Now\", first attempted by Tin Machine during the sessions for their 1989 debut album, was adapted into the title track for Outside.

Tony and Hunt had previously performed alongside Bowie as part of Iggy Pop's backing band during his 1977 tour for The Idiot. Kevin Armstrong played additional guitar and keyboards on the band's first studio album and first tour, and American guitarist Eric Schermerhorn played on the second tour and live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby (1992).", "The first public fruits of Bowie and Gabrels working together came with a new arrangement by Gabrels of the song \"Look Back in Anger\" which Bowie had written with Brian Eno in 1979 for the album Lodger. The occasion was a benefit show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) on 1 July 1988 at which Bowie had been invited to perform with the avant-garde dance troupe La La La Human Steps. Bowie sang, played and danced with troupe members while in lighted grottoes upstage three musicians (Gabrels on guitar, Kevin Armstrong on guitar, and Erdal K\u0131z\u0131l\u00e7ay on bass) played the new  minute score that Gabrels created from the 3-minute song; the new material included drums programmed by K\u0131z\u0131l\u00e7ay. \"We went into the studio to rearrange it,\" said Bowie in a filmed interview; \"I like the hard-edged wall of guitar sound that we put into it.\""]}, {"page": "Tin Machine (album)", "response": ["Tin Machine is the debut studio album by Anglo-American hard rock band Tin Machine, released on 22 May 1989 by EMI America Records. The band consisted of English singer-songwriter David Bowie, American guitarist Reeves Gabrels and brothers Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively, while Englishman Kevin Armstrong acted as an additional guitarist. The project was spearheaded by Bowie, who felt disconnected in his career by 1987 and looked to reinvent himself. After meeting Gabrels through his Glass Spider Tour, the two agreed to work together and would collaborate frequently for the next decade. Bowie hired the Sales brothers, neither of whom he had worked with since the 1970s, after a meeting in Los Angeles, while English producer Tim Palmer was hired to co-produce.", "An addition in the sessions was guitarist Kevin Armstrong, who had played with Bowie at Live Aid in 1985. In the studio, Hunt Sales arranged his drum set on a riser, which overpowered the room, leaving the guitarists unable to hear themselves play. Armstrong recalled, \"He is the loudest drummer I have ever worked with ... I almost went deaf within the first couple of days.\" Meanwhile, Palmer set up various microphones around the studio in order to capture a live sound. The tracks on the album were recorded raw and live with few overdubs to capture the energy of the band. The other Tin Machine members urged Bowie to avoid re-writing his lyrics: \"They were there all the time saying, 'Don't wimp out,' sing like you wrote it ... I have done and frequently do censor myself in terms of lyrics. I say one thing and then I think, 'Ah maybe I'll just take the edge off that a bit.\" He elaborated, \"We wanted to come out of the box with energy, the energy we felt when we were writing and playing. There's very, very little over-dubbing on [the album]. For us [it] is our live sound.\" Bowie was also keen on improvising lyrics while standing at the microphone, which he previously did recording \"Heroes\" (1977). He primarily sang about the first topics that came to him. Gabrels told Buckley that Tin Machine was recorded digitally, which most people at the time figured could not have been done for the sound they were playing.", "* Kevin Armstrong \u2013 rhythm guitar, Hammond organ (B-3) (\"Pretty Thing\")"]}, {"page": "Tin Machine II", "response": ["Tin Machine was formed in 1988 by David Bowie, who was at an artistic low point and looking to revitalise his career.

She was determined to make it her own personal album, totally unlike the ones she had made two decades previously. Seven of the eleven tracks were co-written by Shaw herself, four of which alongside Chris Andrews, who had written the vast majority of her 1960s hit singles. Morrissey and Stephen Street provided the song \"Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness\" which would become the first single to be released from the album. Street was also given production credits for most of the songs. Writing credits were also given to Jim and William Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain on the song \"Cool About You.\" Guitarist Kevin Armstrong was credited on every track with the exception of the now two-year-old \"Hand in Glove\" which credited Johnny Marr as guitarist and the rest of The Smiths as musicians. Armstrong also co-wrote two tracks with Shaw and was given production credits on one track. Writer/producer Clive Langer was also given credits on the song \"Comrade In Arms.\"", "The opening track is called \"Nothing Less Than Brilliant\" and is written by Shaw and Andrews. Shaw had lost confidence in herself after her initial fame and had spent much of the 1970s poor after her divorce from bankrupt fashion designer Jeff Banks. As mentioned previously, Shaw later came to realise that she had influenced other people, and this song talks about her perception of herself and how she was seen by others in a more positive light. \"Nothing Less Than Brilliant\" became the second and final single to be released from the album, and later became the title of a 1994 compilation album. Song number two, the title track, is another Shaw/Andrews track. Andrews had originally written the music for Morrissey to put lyrics to, but Shaw ended up doing them herself instead. \"Take Him\", also by Shaw and Andrews, is a tongue-in-cheek rumba/cha-cha-inspired song rumoured to be based on a true incident with Morrissey. \"A Girl Called Johnny\" is the first of two cover versions on the album, and was originally recorded by The Waterboys. Mike Scott had originally written the song about American singer Patti Smith. \"Strange Bedfellows\", by Shaw and Kevin Armstrong is one of the more eccentric tracks on the album, telling the story of a married couple engaged in some sort of gender-swapping role-play. \"Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness\" was written by Morrissey and Stephen Street for Morrissey's first solo album. A demo was recorded though it did not end up on the final product. It was instead given to Shaw who took to the song straight away, and it became the first single to be released from the album.", "Side two of the album begins with a new mix of Shaw's original Rough Trade hit \"Hand in Glove\", which had originally been The Smiths's first single. Stephen Street is credited as remixing the track. \"Cool About You\" is a Phil Spector-influenced song written by Jim and Willian Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain. Several effects used here are reminiscent of the wall of sound, such as plucked strings sounding like raindrops. \"Flesh and Blood\" is the other track on which Kevin Armstrong is credited as writing alongside Shaw. \"Comrade In Arms\" is possibly the most significant song on the album. Written by Shaw and Clive Langer, it tells of the relationship Shaw had with a close friend who was dying of AIDS. She finished writing the lyrics on the day he died, and it was recorded in the studio in the middle of the night with some friends present. \"I Will Remain\" is the final track on the album, and once again Shaw and Andrews are given writing credits.", "*Kevin Armstrong - guitar"]}, {"page": "Steve McQueen (album)", "response": ["* Kevin Armstrong \u2013 guitar (6, 9)"]}]}}
