He served in the First Anglo-Chinese War (1839\u20131841), in India from 1843 to 1855 where he was deputy adjutant-general at Madras, and was commander of the British Forces in Australia from 1856 to 1861. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 31 May 1865, and to full general eight years later.\nHe was commander of the British Forces in New Zealand from 1860 to 1861, and was on the Executive Council. He commanded during the First Taranaki War, but as he realised the doubtful validity of the Waitara Purchase (the main cause of the war), he disagreed with Governor Gore Browne, and his military action was ridiculed by the local settlers. He was created KCB for his services in New Zealand by the British Government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "First Taranaki War", "response": ["* Thomas Simson Pratt, British General"]}, {"page": "John Lucas (VC)", "response": ["The action was part of the First Taranaki War during the New Zealand Wars.
