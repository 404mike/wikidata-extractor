Bastard", "itemDescription": "Amateur cricketer (1862-1901)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Bastard", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Edward William Bastard (28 February 1862 \u2013 2 April 1901) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Oxford University and Somerset. Bastard was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, described in his Wisden obituary as Somerset's best bowler during his time with the club. Bastard was also part of the Oxford team often said to be the university's best ever.\nHis first-class career was confined to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close to the top of the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.", "link_mentions": {}}}
