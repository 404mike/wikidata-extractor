Bastard was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, described in his Wisden obituary as Somerset's best bowler during his time with the club. Bastard was also part of the Oxford team often said to be the university's best ever.\nHis first-class career was confined to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close to the top of the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E.W. Bastard", "response": ["#redirect E. W.

He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.", "During the following season, Fothergill only appeared once for Somerset, in a match against Kent early in the season. He took four for 87 in the match, which was his final first-class appearance for the county. Fothergill was again selected to play for the South against the North, but bowled just three overs in the match, without taking a wicket. The remainder of his notable appearances that season were made for the MCC, though few were considered first-class. He performed well in matches against Wiltshire and Leicestershire, taking eleven wickets in each match, including seven for 62 in the second innings against Leicestershire, but neither match had first-class status. In 1885, he enjoyed his best match for the South, taking four wickets in each innings as the North were defeated by nine wickets. The majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for the MCC, although he did appear four times in 1886 for Somerset, which had been stripped of its first-class status.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. In contrast, in 1887 and 1888, he played almost exclusively for the county, appearing just three times for the MCC. Somerset, who had relied on the bowling of Fothergill in the early 1880s, were spearheaded by E. W. Bastard, Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods in the late 1880s, and Fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs. Despite this, he was presented with a bat during 1888, a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century.Roebuck (1991), pp. 43\u201345."]}, {"page": "EW Bastard", "response": ["#redirect E.
