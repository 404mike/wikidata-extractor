These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard's agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit and the three mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The calico printing factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2\u00bd million pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the sulphite method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.", "From a group of small mills at Bridge End, John Wood built a complex of mills. Bridge End Mill was originally built in 1782 as a fulling mill. Today one mill building is being restored, and the Milltown mills lie idle."]}, {"page": "John (given name)", "response": ["*John Wood (surgeon) (1825\u20131891), British surgeon at King's College Hospital", "*John Wood (baseball) (1872\u20131929), baseball player", "*John Wood (canoeist) (1950\u20132013), Canadian Olympic flatwater canoer", "*John Wood (racing driver) (born 1952), CART driver", "*John Wood (rugby league) (born 1956), Great Britain, and Leigh", "*John Wood (millowner) (1758\u2013????), created the Howard Town Mills complex in Glossop, England", "*John Wood (Bradford manufacturer) (1793\u20131871), English industrialist and factory reformer", "*John Wood (explorer) (1812\u20131871), Scottish explorer of central Asia", "*John Wood (photographer), Civil War photographer for Union Army"]}, {"page": "John Wood", "response": ["John Wood may refer to:", "* John Wood, the Elder (1704\u20131754), English architect", "* John Wood, the Younger (1728\u20131782) architect", "* John Wood (professor) (c.1775\u20131822), American professor of mathematics", "* John Wood (design theorist) (born 1945), British professor of design ", "* John Wood (activist) (born 1964), education activist, marketing director at Microsoft", "* Sir John Wood (professor of law) (1932 -
