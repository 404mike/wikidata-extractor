He had a trial with Aston Villa, but Ron Saunders decided against signing him due to Villa having recently taken on an apprentice goalkeeper. BBC Essex sports presenter Roger Buxton, recommended Delf to Southend United chief scout Bob Walls, eventually signing on non-contract terms in 1983. He made a number of reserve team appearances before making his debut on 26 March 1983 in the Football League Third Division for Southend against Sheffield United, in the 3\u20131 home victory. Southend's regular goalkeepers Mervyn Cawston and John Keeley were both injured, and Delf was drafted in on the morning of the day of the match. The one goal Delf conceded was a penalty kick taken by Colin Morris. He went on to play non-League football for Dartford under Peter Taylor, signing from Southend in 1986, before joining Grays Athletic for whom he made over 300 appearances."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Mervyn Cawston"]}, {"page": "Daniel Bentley", "response": ["In the 2014\u201315 season, Bentley broke Mervyn Cawston's club record of 10 consecutive home clean sheets with 12 in a row between October and April."]}, {"page": "List of Southend United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Mervyn Cawston||||GK||1974, 1978\u20131984||242||0||"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Mervyn Cawston"]}]}}
