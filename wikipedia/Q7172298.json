An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist Pete Thomas, were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie Blue Suede Shoes, filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in Birmingham was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, Everyone Can Rock & Roll, issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death."]}, {"page": "Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!", "response": ["* Trombone (track 1) \u2013 Pete Thomas"]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Pete Thomas"]}, {"page": "Fables of the Reconstruction", "response": ["* Pete Thomas\u00a0\u2013 tenor saxophone on \"Cant Get There from Here\""]}, {"page": "To Bring You My Love", "response": ["*Pete Thomas - string arrangements"]}, {"page": "Ice on Fire", "response": ["* Pete Thomas \u2013 tenor saxophone (9)"]}, {"page": "Hand of Kindness", "response": ["Several songs feature the twin saxophones of Pete Zorn and Pete Thomas, and for about 18 months after the release of Hand of Kindness, Thompson toured with his \"Big Band\" that featured the two sax players prominently.", "*Pete Thomas - saxophone"]}, {"page": "Across a Crowded Room", "response": ["* Pete Thomas\u00a0\u2013 tenor saxophone"]}, {"page": "Mirror Blue", "response": ["*Pete Thomas \u2013 drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "Highfield, Southampton", "response": ["*Pete Thomas, musician and composer"]}]}}
