He did his National Service in the Royal Navy after which he was posted to RAF China Bay at Trincomalee, in modern-day Sri Lanka, as a sub-lieutenant (special) in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves.He joined the Colonial Service in 1958 and was stationed as a District Officer in Tanganyika, which was then part of the British Empire. When Tanganyika gained independence in 1964, Taylor went to British Guiana in South America where he worked for Booker as the head of one of the company's six divisions. In 1976, he went back to Africa where he became chief executive of Booker in Malawi and later Zambia.In 1983, Taylor went on secondment from Booker to become the first chief executive of the Falkland Islands, a post which had been created on the recommendation of the second report by Lord Shackleton. During his four years in office, Taylor was credited with helping the Falklands become self-sufficient following the Argentine occupation, as well as years of stagnation before then. Taylor left the islands in 1987, but returned the next year to act as interim chief executive for eight months.Taylor then briefly worked as director of a subsidiary agricultural consultancy at Booker-McConnell before being appointed Governor of Montserrat in 1990, helping to rebuild the Caribbean island after it had been hit by Hurricane Hugo a year earlier. Taylor retired in 1993 and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1997, Taylor helped raise money for the reconstruction of Montserrat following the eruption of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano which left most of the island uninhabitable.David Taylor died of a lung condition on the 8th November 2007 and is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Taylor", "response": ["* David Taylor (musician), with James Taylor Quartet", "* David Taylor (Home and Away), fictional character in the Australian soap opera Home and Away", "* David Taylor (actor) in The Adventures of the Black Stallion", "* David Taylor (writer), winner of the Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry", "* David Taylor (Green politician) (born 1957), UK Green Party politician", "* David Taylor (Labour politician) (1946\u20132009), UK Labour Party politician", "* David Taylor (Washington politician) (born 1972), politician from the US state of Washington", "* David Taylor (New Zealand diplomat) on List of ambassadors of New Zealand to South Korea", "* David Taylor (American football) (born 1949), American football player", "* David Taylor (football administrator) (1954\u20132014), General Secretary of UEFA", "* David Taylor (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131949), Scottish football player and manager, FA Cup winner with Bradford City in 1911 and 1914 with Burnley", "* David Taylor (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u2013?), English footballer for Darlington, Heart of Midlothian and Bristol Rovers", "* David Taylor (Welsh footballer) (born 1965), Welsh football player, European Golden Shoe winner", "* David Taylor (Canadian football) in 1986 CFL Draft", "* David Taylor (Nicaragua footballer) in 1997 UNCAF Nations Cup", "* David Taylor (rugby union), played in 1966\u201367 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "* David Taylor (Australian cricketer) (1881\u2013?)", "* David Taylor (chess player) (born 1941), International Correspondence Chess Federation United States champion", "* David Taylor (English cricketer) (born 1974)", "* David Taylor (snooker player) (born 1943), snooker player", "* David Taylor (wrestler, born 1990), American professional wrestler, Tokyo 2020 Olympic gold medalist in 86\u00a0kg", "* David Taylor (athlete) in 1995 European Cross Country Championships", "* David Taylor (basketball), player in 2012 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship", "* David Taylor (ice hockey), played in 2007 Memorial Cup", "* David Taylor (swimmer), participated in Swimming at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre freestyle S9", "* David Taylor (banker) (1929\u20132009), banker", "* David Taylor (veterinary surgeon) (1934\u20132013), television presenter on animal subjects", "* David Taylor (Wisconsin judge) (1818\u20131891), American jurist and legislator", "* David Taylor (programmer) on World Rugby"]}]}}
