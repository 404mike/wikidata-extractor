There is a sense of melancholia in his work which some have attributed to his personal misfortune: his ill-health, living in near poverty, and two failed love affairs. O'Meara was a popular companion amongst the English-speaking painters, including John Lavery, William Stott and Carl Larsson. Stott's work bears the strongest influence from O'Meara, though Lavery noted that of all the artists in Grez, O'Meara influenced him the most. O'Meara exhibited R\u00eaverie in \"A collection of pictures by British artists from the Paris salon\" at the Fine Art Society in London in July 1882, and some more work was shown at the Liverpool Autumn Exhibition in 1883 and at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1884, 1885 and 1887.

Exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery and the Grafton Galleries in London led to invitations from Secession galleries in Vienna, Munich, Berlin in the 1890s and, later, to exhibitions in U.S. cities.   Dow also joined the New English Art Club (NEAC) in 1887 and exhibited with them until 1891. Dow spent the summer of 1888 travelling in Switzerland and Germany painting in the mountains, some of the time in the company of William Stott.

He trained in Paris under Carolus Duran and was strongly influenced by the Rustic Naturalism of Bastien-Lepage and the work of the Impressionists which he married with the English landscape tradition of John Linnell and Samuel Palmer. In the mid 1880s he settled in rural Sussex where he was the central figure in an artistic colony. His forte was painting scenes of domestic and working rural life and the surrounding landscapes often depicted in fading light. Stott's work achieved critical and commercial success at home and in Europe in his lifetime but his style of painting became unfashionable in the aftermath of the Great War and much of his work is now neglected and unconsidered.Szabolcsi, (1970) The Decline of Romanticism: End of the Century, Turn of the Century-Introductory Sketch of an Essay, Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.Stott used his middle name for commercial purposes to avoid confusion with an Oldham artist called William Stott (1857\u20131900). As both were from mill-owning families and contemporaries who studied in Paris the confusion was perhaps inevitable. It may explain why each Stott chose different French artistic colonies within which to work.There is yet another William Stott working in this period. William Robertson Smith Stott (1870\u20131939) was a painter and illustrator of portraits, figures and landscape in oil who lived in Aberdeen and later moved to Chelsea. He exhibited twenty-two works at the Royal Academy between 1905\u20131934."]}]}}
