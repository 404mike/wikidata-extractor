Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone's work gave the law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that \"If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that the United States, and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law.\" In the United States, the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, James Wilson, John Jay, John Adams, James Kent and Abraham Lincoln, and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions.", "Blackstone's primary legacy is his written work, specifically the Commentaries on the Laws of England. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was \"almost inexhaustible\" in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the Commentaries' emphasis on the sovereignty of Parliament drew ire. Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as \"an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment\".Prest (2008) p. 307 Other commentators differ; one described him as \"the core element in the British Enlightenment\", comparing him to Montesquieu, Beccaria and Voltaire.Prest (2008) p. 308 Academics have said that the Commentaries were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of substantive law.Cairns (1984) p. 319 At the time of publication, the common law of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The Commentaries helped to solidify legal thinking.Miles (2000) p. 46 At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that \"if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [the United States], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [common] law\".Holdsworth (1928) p. 157"]}, {"page": "Bleak House", "response": ["For most readers and scholars, the central concern of Bleak House is its indictment of the English Chancery court system. Chancery or equity courts were one half of the English civil justice system, existing side-by-side with law courts. Chancery courts heard actions having to do with wills and estates, or with the uses of private property. By the mid-nineteenth century, English law reformers had long criticised the delays of Chancery litigation, and Dickens found the subject a tempting target. He already had taken a shot at law-courts and that side of the legal profession in his 1837 novel The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club or The Pickwick Papers. Scholars, such as the English legal historian Sir William Searle Holdsworth, in his 1928 series of lectures,Charles Dickens as a Legal Historian published by Yale University Press have made a plausible case for treating Dickens's novels, and Bleak House in particular, as primary sources illuminating the history of English law."]}, {"page": "List of members of the Order of Merit", "response": ["| 75. ||  || 75px || Sir William Searle Holdsworth || 1 January 1943 || 7 May 1871 \u2013 2 January 1944 || Legal Scholar"]}, {"page": "Competition law", "response": ["Europe around the 16th century was changing quickly.

William Searle Holdsworth argued the former position, whereas Theodore Plucknett argued the latter. Holdsworth's History of English Law cites an early legal opinion by John Stonor as well as Blackstone's Commentaries for the proposition that the writ was of an equitable nature. Plucknett's A Concise History of the Common Law argues that the writ provided no greater relief than was traditionally available at common law for abuse of process. He also offers a different interpretation of Stonor's statement, arguing that it means the writ permitted a defendant to assert common law defenses where a statute's intent was to make such defenses inaccessible. As such, Plucknett argues that the circumstances under which the writ was available were few and circumscribed."]}, {"page": "Glanville Williams", "response": ["Williams was born on 15 February 1911 in Bridgend, Wales.
