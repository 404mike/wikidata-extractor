During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.\nMoore was particularly noted for his \"filmstar good looks\" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.\nMoore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as \"Mr Privatisation\". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.\nMoore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 26", "response": ["*  1937   \u2013 John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, English businessman and politician, Secretary of State for Health (d. 2019) "]}]}}
