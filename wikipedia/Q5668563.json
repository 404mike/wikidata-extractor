Although he wasn't qualified as a teacher, he was eventually co-opted as such, due to his 33 years of service.His appearance for Clapton once sparked an article in the local newspaper after he had requested permission to leave work early to attend a game. Previous requests had been declined, but this time, his request was granted following a vote. In the article, members of the West Ham School Board described football, and cricket, as being a waste of time. This denunciation of sport was supported by the local priest, Father Ring, who said that it was only a little less of a scandal than the drinking business.Further controversy was to come when he was declared to be a professional by the Football Association. He had accepted a set of furniture from Clapton as a wedding gift and the FA had deemed this to be a form of payment. Both Earle and the club unsuccessfully appealed. As a result, Earle signed as a professional with Notts County, where he played in the Football League for one season. He continued to be the trainer of West Ham Schools throughout his playing career and beyond his retirement, leaving the role in 1912.When he returned to the Old Spotted Dog Ground with his new club in 1905 for a friendly match, he encountered opposite number J. Wilding, who had once been the West Ham Schools goalkeeper under his charge. Wilding would go on to play for Clapton in two FA Amateur Cup finals.Married to Emma Elizabeth Earle, he was the father of six children, one of whom, Stan Earle also played for Clapton, and for England as an Amateur and Full International and later, as a professional player, with West Ham United between 1924 and 1932.Harry Earle died in 1951. His obituary, in the Stratford Express, was adamant that he had never once accepted a pay packet despite the imposition of his professional status.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stan Earle", "response": ["Stan, the son of centre-half and goalkeeper Harry Earle, played for West Ham Schools as a youth.

Earle featured for the FA XI against the Army in both seasons, and also represented the Isthmian League.

A crowd of 10,000 attended the match, which ended 1\u20131. The Hammers went on to win the replay at the Old Spotted Dog Ground 3\u20132 after Billy Grassam scored a hat-trick. The Clapton \u2018keeper Harry Earle (whose son later played for West Ham) had been at fault for the second after running out and leaving his goal unguarded.

Then followed a loss to Bristol City and three victories, over Swindon Town, Watford and Luton Town, before the club\u2019s worst defeat of the season on 16 February. This came at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur, a 4\u20131 loss in which Tommy Moore, deputising in goal for Hugh Monteith who had lumbago, was at fault for three of the goals. This would prove to be his final appearance for the club and he left at the end of the season after three years of service."]}]}}
