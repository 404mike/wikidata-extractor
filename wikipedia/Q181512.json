He played for Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.He captained Great Britain to gold medals at the 1908 Olympics in London and in Stockholm in 1912. Woodward's tally of 29 goals in 23 matches for England remained a record from 1911 to 1958; his strike rate of 1.26 goals per game is the second highest for an England player.\nHe served in the British Army during the First World War, and as a result missed out on Chelsea's run to their first-ever FA Cup final in 1915. Woodward's injuries during the war caused his retirement from football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England national football team", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left\"|Vivian Woodward"]}, {"page": "January 31", "response": ["*  1954   \u2013 Vivian Woodward, English captain and footballer (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "June 3", "response": ["*  1879   \u2013 Vivian Woodward, English footballer and soldier (d. 1954)"]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["*  Vivian Woodward"]}, {"page": "Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|IR || || Vivian Woodward ", "|valign=\"top\"| Horace BaileyArthur BerryFrederick ChapmanWalter CorbettHarold HardmanRobert HawkesKenneth HuntHerbert SmithHarold StapleyClyde PurnellVivian Woodward  George BarlowThose players were also in squad, but did not play any matches.

The number of teams rose to eleven in 1912, when the competition was organised by the Swedish Football Association. Many of these early matches were unbalanced, as evidenced by high scoring games; two players, Sophus Nielsen in 1908 and Gottfried Fuchs in 1912, each scored ten goals in a single match. All players were amateurs, in accordance with the Olympic spirit, which meant that some countries could not send their full international team. The National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Ireland asked the Football Association to send an English national amateur team. Some of the English members played with professional clubs, most notably Derby County's Ivan Sharpe, Bradford City F.C. Harold Walden and Chelsea's Vivian Woodward. England won the first two official tournaments convincingly, beating Denmark both times."]}]}}
