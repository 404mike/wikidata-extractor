S. Gilbert.  She was a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1881 to 1883, when she left the company following her engagement to a nobleman, young Arthur William Cairns, Lord Garmoyle (later the 2nd Earl Cairns).  Cairns soon broke off the engagement under pressure from his friends, and Fortescue returned to the stage in leading roles.\nWith the \u00a310,000 that she received in her breach of promise lawsuit, Fortescue started her own touring theatre company, often performing the plays of W. S. Gilbert.  Coincidentally, Gilbert visited Fortescue on the day he died.  Her acting career continued until 1926.", "link_mentions": {}}}
