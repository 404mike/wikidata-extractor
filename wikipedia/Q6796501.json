S. Gilbert.  She was a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1881 to 1883, when she left the company following her engagement to a nobleman, young Arthur William Cairns, Lord Garmoyle (later the 2nd Earl Cairns).  Cairns soon broke off the engagement under pressure from his friends, and Fortescue returned to the stage in leading roles.\nWith the \u00a310,000 that she received in her breach of promise lawsuit, Fortescue started her own touring theatre company, often performing the plays of W. S. Gilbert.  Coincidentally, Gilbert visited Fortescue on the day he died.

In 1882, he realised an ambition to act in a strong serious dramatic role. For Florence Terry's farewell performance, a revival of W. S. Gilbert's play Broken Hearts was billed. A strong cast was chosen, including Terry's sister Marion Terry, May Fortescue and Julia Gwynne,The Era, 24 June 1882 p. 7 but the two actors who had previously played the role of the misanthropic dwarf Mousta were unavailable. Thornton asked to play the part. \"What, Major Murgatroyd?\" said Gilbert, thinking the idea preposterous, but he gave Thornton a chance and was impressed. Thornton again appeared in Broken Hearts at his own benefit performance at the Savoy Theatre in February 1883.

A revival of Gilbert's comic opera Princess Toto was also briefly considered, but Gilbert balked at Carte's suggested revisions.Stedman, p. 310 Instead, Gilbert turned to writing a new contemporary drama, The Fortune Hunter, commissioned by Edward Willard. But Willard was not satisfied with Gilbert's drafts, and the manager of the St James's Theatre, who had asked Gilbert for a play, found it unsuitable.
