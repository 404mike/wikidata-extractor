He was Keeper of the Archives and a lecturer in diplomatics at the University of Oxford, where he gave the Ford Lectures in 1912 on the subject of \"The Exchequer in the Twelfth Century\". Son of Edward Stanley Poole, the \"Lane\" in his surname comes from his paternal grandmother Sophia Lane Poole, author of An Englishwoman in Egypt (1844). He was the father of Austin Lane Poole (1889\u20131963), also a historian and Ford's Lecturer; the brother of the orientalist Stanley Lane-Poole; the nephew of Reginald Stuart Poole; and the great-nephew of Edward William Lane.He edited, among other works, with W. Hunt, Political History of England (twelve volumes, 1905\u201310).His works include:\n\nHistory of the Huguenots of the Dispersion (1880)\nIllustrations of the History of Medieval Thought (1884)\nWycliffe and Movements for Reform (1889)\nHistorical Atlas of Modern Europe (1897\u20131902)\nLectures on the History of the Papal Chancery (1915)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pope Benedict IX", "response": ["According to Reginald Lane Poole, \"In a time of acute political hostility accusations, as we know too well, are made and are believed, which in a calmer time would never have been suggested.\" He further suggests the credibility of such accusations was determined by probability rather than proof, and a reaction to the Tusculan hegemony. Poole observes that \"we have to wait until he had discredited himself by his sale of the Papacy before we hear anything definite about his misdeeds; and the further we go in time and place, the worse his character becomes\". Poole considers Benedict \"a negligent Pope, very likely a profligate man\", but notes that the picture presented of Benedict is drawn at a time when the party opposed to him was in the ascendant, and he had neither friends nor supporters."]}, {"page": "John Bale", "response": ["This chronological catalogue of British authors and their works was partly founded on the De uiris illustribus of John Leland. Bale was an indefatigable collector and worker, and personally examined many of the valuable libraries of the Augustinian and Carmelite houses before their dissolution. His work contains much information that would otherwise have been hopelessly lost. His autograph note-book is preserved in the Selden Collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It contains the materials collected for his two published catalogues arranged alphabetically, without enlargement on them nor the personal remarks which colour the completed work.

He wrote: \"In these thirty-five cantatas a series of the most beautiful and the best known Protestant chorales of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is subjected to elaborate treatment.\" He noted that in , the chorale, which was not originally written for the occasion of the Annunciation, had to be connected by expanded poetry to the topic of the feast.
