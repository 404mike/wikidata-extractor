This growth changed the character of the railway and had a profound influence upon its motive power policy and passenger train services. In the 1870s and 1880s it led to the building of new standard tank engine classes such as the Terrier and D1 classes under William Stroudley. R. J. Billinton replaced these with the D3, E3, E4, and E5 classes designed for London suburban services, during the 1890s. When steam locomotives became unable to cope with the increased suburban traffic and competition from electric trams in the early 20th century, it resulted in the electrification of the London suburban network.", "The LB&SCR achieved early fame as the first railway to use the Jenny Lind  locomotive in 1847, designed by David Joy, the Chief Draughtsman of the E.B.Wilson and Company of Leeds, later widely used by other railways. The policy of John Chester Craven, Locomotive Superintendent from 1847 to 1869, was to design locomotives for each task or type of traffic. Many of his designs were capable locomotives, but with 72 different classes in use at the time of William Stroudley's appointment in 1870, the policy was hopelessly uneconomic.", "*William Stroudley (1870\u20131889) \u2013 died in office"]}, {"page": "Highland Railway", "response": ["The Inverness & Aberdeen Junction and Inverness & Perth Junction Railway were merged on 1 February 1865, and became known as the Highland Railway on 29 June 1865.

The Inverness & Nairn had built a locomotive works at Lochgorm in 1855, just outside Inverness station, and that became the site of the Highland's works. Later, carriage shops were built alongside.

Notable late examples include William Stroudley's singles of 1874-1880, William Dean's 157 class of 1878-79, and his 3001 class (1891\u201392), both for the Great Western Railway.

The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This inverted arrangement of slide valves and steam chest, originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LB&SCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder's steam port faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the steam chest was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6\u00b0 to the centre line of the valves, each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the valve rods to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this arrangement of cylinders, valves and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves."]}, {"page": "Science and invention in Birmingham", "response": ["1847: William Stroudley joins Birmingham engineer John Inshaw as one of his most successful pupils.

The class has received several nicknames, initially being known as \"Rooters\" by their south London crews. However, the engines were more famously known as \"Terriers\" on account of the distinctive 'bark' of the exhaust beat. Later in their careers, some engines were known as \"Hayling Billy\" on account of their work on the Hayling Island branch line.
