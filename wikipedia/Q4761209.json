Fulham chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed had given manager Kevin Keegan \u00a312 million to spend on Fulham, whereas Graydon spent only \u00a330,000 to bring in Gillingham defender Richard Green. Manchester City and Reading had also spent millions, yet finished behind the \"Saddlers\". Walsall had been slated as  one of the bookies' favourites for relegation before the season began, having finished in 19th-place in 1997\u201398 and selling French stars Roger Boli and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9ron. Within the League Managers Association, Graydon came behind only Alex Ferguson in the poll for Manager of the Season. He stuck to a rigid 4\u20134\u20132 system, and picked up 12 away wins operating a counter-attacking system. His best signing proved to be midfielder Darren Wrack, who came on a free transfer from Grimsby Town and went on to be voted onto the PFA Team of the Year. He also brought in left-back Neil Pointon and striker Andy Rammell. He maintained strict discipline, stressing that \"fitness is absolutely vital\"."]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["As Birmingham were in the First Division, they entered the competition in the first round.

In the replay goals from Thompson and McCarthy sealed a very satisfying 2\u20131 win but in the third round they were paired with an unglamorous but difficult tie at home to Grimsby Town. McCarthy equalised to take it a replay and on a freezing cold January evening in Cleethorpes history was made. It was a night of personal triumph for young midfielder Martyn Lee. On the half hour he whipped in a free-kick and McCarthy flicked the ball past the keeper. Two minutes another Lee free-kick was only cleared to the edge of the area and Michael Simpson volleyed home. Grimsby pulled a goal back just before half-time but with almost an hour on the clock Mark Rogers headed home a Lee corner to make it 3\u20131. Wycombe Wanderers were in the fourth round for the first time in the club's history. They were drawn at home to the other WWFC, Wolverhampton Wanderers. A 9,617 sell-out watched Andy Rammell poke home ten minutes before half-time and celebrated by diving into the snow. Wolves snatched a deserved equaliser early in the second half but with five minutes to go a deep cross from Steve Brown was headed emphatically into the corner of the net by Sam Parkin to make it 2\u20131 and spark more scenes of celebration.", "Wycombe faced a seemingly fateful fifth round encounter with Lawrie Sanchez's former club Wimbledon and after the Wombles had taken a 2\u20130 first half lead, a deflected Michael Simpson and a suspiciously offside looking equaliser from Steve Brown took the tie to a replay at Selhurst Park. 4,551 Wycombe fans made the journey to South London and Gareth Ainsworth soon gave the Dons the lead. Halfway through the first half Dave Carroll fired in an equaliser after Rammell's shot was blocked. Andy Rammell was then replaced by Andy Baird after suffering a recurrence of a groin injury and Baird lasted less than five minutes after a shocking challenge from Dons defender Mark Williams. Baird had to be carried off and he was replaced by Parkin. The second half was tight affair but the home side gained a numerical advantage when Michael Simpson was sent off for a second bookable offence. In the last minute Paul McCarthy was adjudged to have handled the ball but goalkeeper Martin Taylor pulled off a fine save to deny Neal Ardley from the spot. However, in the first minute of extra time Wayne Gray fired home to give Wimbledon a 2\u20131 lead. There seemed no way back for the Wanderers as the clock ticked into the 120th minute but Bulman's sliced shot from the edge fell perfectly for McCarthy to poke the ball past Kelvin Davis to make it 2\u20132. Penalties it was and it went to sudden death. It looked all over again when Jamie Bates' penalty was saved by Davis but Taylor then saved from Peter Hawkins. The goalkeeper then scored himself and when Mark Williams smashed his kick high over the bar, the celebrations could begin, the Wanderers winning 8\u20137."]}, {"page": "Rammell", "response": ["*Andy Rammell (born 1967), former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Andy Rammell"]}]}}
