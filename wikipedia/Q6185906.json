Finn has the power of telekinesis, \"but he doesn\u2019t really know how to use it\". Writing for The Independent, Neela Debanth said she finds Jess more likeable than Finn although \"there is more to Finn on closer inspection\". Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy said that McMullen \"makes a strong first impression\" while Jordan Farley of SFX said Finn has his \"moments to shine\" but that he ultimately \"fails to make a big impression\". Simon Cocks, writing for MSN, said Finn and Jess \"fit into the dynamic perfectly\".", "Finn arrives for his first day of community service where he meets fellow young offender Jess (Karla Crome).

Debnath felt that out of series four's new characters of Finn and Jess, Jess \"comes across as the more likeable and \u2018conventional\u2019 social miscreant compared to Finn. Saying this, there is more to Finn on closer inspection, namely the girl tied to his bed\". Debnath felt that Overman \"is clearly trying to avoid replicating personalities in order to make sure that Jess and Finn are not seen as replacements but characters in their own right. However, neither of them  as distinct as their predecessors. It is more difficult to pigeonhole them, which in this case is not a good thing because it makes it difficult to get a sense of them\". Debnath felt the humour was at times \"just not as pithy as it has been in the past, particularly with Finn\". Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy said that Finn is \"not so much a motor-mouth as someone who suffers perpetually from 'word vomit', coming out with all manner of bizarre and dark ramblings in his efforts to impress\". Jeffrey added that the show may have begun to find itself with \"the intriguing reveal that Finn - previously a bit of a one-note buffoon - may have quite the dark side\". He concluded that \"both Crome and McMullen make a strong first impression\". Jordan Farley of SFX said the episode \"actively encourages us to dislike, or at least be put off by, these characters\" such as when \"Finn tells some reprehensible fibs\". He added that Finn and Jess \"have their moments to shine, but we never really get a sense of how they will fit into the new gang or even who they are. [...] Finn we get a better handle on. He\u2019s a little bit like a cowardly, scouse version of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker, constantly telling tall tales about his past, but whatever we learn is coloured by the reveal at the end of the episode\". He added that the characters' introductions \"fail to make a big impression\". Simon Cocks, writing for MSN, said Finn and Jess \"fit into the dynamic perfectly\". He added that it would \"be exciting\" to see them in action as the show progresses. Metro journalist Sarah Deen opined that \"from the moment loud-mouthed-lout-with-a-dark-side Finn cracks a joke about his mother in extremely bad taste to the pitch-dark closing moments, it\u2019s a riot; with Nathan McMullen proving he can be just as feisty as the existing characters in his role as Finn\".", "Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy felt that Finn's storyline with his father's ex-girlfriend Lisa is more \"interesting - or at least more strange\". She felt the storyline was worth it as it led to \"the heartbreaking scene as Finn discovers that his dad is actually not his biological father - making him even more lovable. And the story also pushes forward the cute blossoming romance between Jess and Finn, making their feelings for each other more clear\"."]}, {"page": "Karla Crome", "response": ["Karla Patsy Crome (born 22 June 1988, London) is a British actress and writer, best known for her work on Sky Atlantic's Hit & Miss, playing series regular Jess on E4's Misfits, and appearances in a number of other television series and films, mainly in the United Kingdom, including the award-winning Murder.
