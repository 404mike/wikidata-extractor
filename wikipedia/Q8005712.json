William was born at Nottingham, England, and emigrated to Australia with his parents during 1853\nIn 1854, he was appointed as Deputy-Sheriff and its electoral officer for the colony, and he was promoted to Sheriff during 1856\nHe prepared the clauses of the South Australian Act of 1856 that instituted voting by ballot and those of the Act of 1858 that provided for the placing of a cross against the name of the favoured candidate. He based his reform on ballots pre-printed with the candidates' names. In a manner similar to that still used widely today, the voter marked the form in secret and placed it in a sealed box. The ballots were collected and counted so that no one could be identified from their voting paper.\nOn 2 April 1856, South Australia enacted a law introducing the secret ballot, which had been adopted two weeks earlier in Victoria.\nThis was a significant change from the British practice, where elections were conducted \"on the voices\". Voters assembled at local election centres where they called out the name of their chosen candidate, and the choice was then entered on a register. That public process made the voter vulnerable to both bribery and intimidation, which caused wide concern.\nBoothby's system was adopted for use in federal government elections in Australia. In the second half of the 19th century, the use of the secret ballot spread to the US and to Europe; in 1892, Grover Cleveland became the first US president elected by Boothby's system, universally referred to as 'the Australian ballot' for nearly a century.\nIn 1893, he was created CMG.\nBoothby was the State Returning Officer for the first Australian House of Representatives election in 1901. The Federal seat of Boothby, established in 1903 in Adelaide, was named in his honour.\nIn his later years, he became Comptroller of Prison Labour and a senator of the University of Adelaide in South Australia.\nHe died in Adelaide.", "link_mentions": []}}
