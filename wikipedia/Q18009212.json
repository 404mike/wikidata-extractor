This summary of his career lists all the responsibilities he held, including some junior offices, while literary sources only record upper magistracies (censor, consul, and praetor); however it does not provide any date and the offices are not ordered chronologically.Ferenczy, \"La carri\u00e8re d'Appius jusqu'\u00e0 la censure\", p. 381. The eulogy tells that he was the military tribune three times, the quaestor one time, and curule aedile two times. These junior magistracies were standard and found in the career of every Roman politician, but the number of times he held these positions is much more unusual. Endre Ferenczy thought Caecus held them all before his censorship because of his family's decline, which forced him to repeat them to build his popularity (especially as aedile, because this magistrate organised games), therefore explaining his early censorship. However, his thesis has been criticised, notably by Stephen Oakley, who notes that there is not enough evidence to know whether iterations of the military tribuneship and aedileship were really exceptional for this period, during which most careers are unknown."]}, {"page": "Kennedy Professor of Latin", "response": ["* Stephen Oakley (2007-)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Stephen Oakley (Emmanuel)"]}, {"page": "Lucius Papirius Cursor", "response": ["The election of both consuls broke the Lex Genucia, passed in 342, which theoretically forbade iteration of a magistracy within ten years. Cursor had been consul in 326, and Philo in 327. However, Corey Brennan suggests that this law only forbade iteration within ten years, so it had lapsed by 332.Brennan, The Praetorship, pp. 65\u201367.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. IV, p. 543, writes that Brennan's \"argument [...] has considerable force, but the standard view remains defensible.\" Philo is the only securely attested political ally of Cursor, as they are found together in office several times, and they likely ran in the elections together in a political ticket. This pattern of a patrician and a plebeian repeatedly sharing the consulship or other magistracies is a feature of Roman politics in the middle Republic, and multiple instances are known, including that of Cursor's son, who shared the consulship twice with Spurius Carvilius Maximus.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 180, 197.Forsythe, Critical History of Early Rome, p. 269. Cursor and Philo were at the time the most competent generals, and Livy writes it was the main reason behind their election because of the military situation after the Caudine Forks.Livy, ix. 7. Stephen Oakley nevertheless doubts that their election was as unanimous as Livy tells.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. III, p. 114."]}, {"page": "Aulia gens", "response": ["The most famous member of the Aulii bore the praenomen Quintus, as did his father and grandfather.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 149, 154.  However, the 315 BC entry in the Fasti Capitolini for the consular Aulius preserves the enigmatic filiation \"Ai. n.\", which meaning has not been explained, as no known praenomen can be shortened as such. Attilio Degrassi, Robert Broughton and others have therefore considered that there were two homonymous men with a different grandfather active at the end of the 4th century BC.Degrassi, Fasti Capitolini, pp. 46, 47 (note for 315).Broughton, vol. I, pp. 156, 157 (note 2).

II, pp. 753, 754."]}, {"page": "L. D. Reynolds", "response": ["Reynolds continued his work on Latin prose authors in 1991 with an edition of the collected works of the Roman historian Sallust. At that time, the standard text had been a 1954 edition by  in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana series. Reynolds innovated by limiting himself to reporting five manuscripts in passages where Kurfess had provided unnecessary detail. For Stephen Oakley, the Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge, the greatest merit of the edition was its judicious provision of readings from less reliable manuscripts, which has led to the solution of a difficult textual problem in chapter 114 of Sallust's Jugurtha. The classicist Stephen Shierling considered the differences between the editions of Kurfess and Reynolds of \"modest importance\" but said the new text was \"cleaner and more consistent\"."]}, {"page": "Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Kennedy Professor of Latin (currently Stephen Oakley)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2000s", "response": ["* Professor Stephen Oakley, Kennedy Professor of Latin, University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Oakley, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Oakley"]}, {"page": "Lucius Horatius Pulvillus", "response": ["*Stephen Oakley, A Commentary on Livy, Books VI-X Volume I: Introduction and Book VI, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1999."]}, {"page": "Servius Cornelius Maluginensis (consular tribune 386 BC)", "response": ["*Stephen Oakley, A Commentary on Livy, Books VI-X Volume I: Introduction and Book VI, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1999."]}]}}
