Originally from Staffordshire, England, he emigrated to Canada in 1819 and eventually moved to the village of York, Upper Canada (later Toronto) with his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Lees) and three children, where he became a prominent early figure.\nBloor kept a hotel, Farmer's Arms Inn, at 157 King Street East (now home to St. Lawrence Hall) from 1824 to 1831 and built a brewery in 1830 in the Rosedale Valley, near Sherbourne Street.He sold the brewery in 1843 (John Rose operated it as Castle Frank Brewery until 1864 and the building was demolished by 1875), and purchased a stretch of land in nearby Yorkville, where he and William Botsford Jarvis laid out streets for residential development.\nThe boundary of Yorkville and Toronto was named Bloor Street in his honour in 1855. Bloor died at his home at 121 Bloor Street East, now demolished near Bloor and Church Street. A plaque commemorating his life can be found in St. Andrew's United Church on Bloor Street East.He is buried at Necropolis Cemetery on Winchester Street in Cabbagetown.\nWhile his tombstone, and those of his descendants, spell the family name \"Bloore\", this was a posthumous development.
