The assailant had seriously injured WPC Kathleen Parrott in March, and on 23 April approached Bush from behind and hit her over the head, making a wound that required eleven stitches. Bush held on to her attacker's coat and tried to hold him, but fell resulting in his escape.When the attacker was eventually caught, WPC Parrott and WPS Bush were among nine women who were able to identify the 29-year-old labourer. In response to her actions, a Judge stated \"I can not imagine higher courage than you showed along that footpath.\" A Chief magistrate added, \"If anyone can imagine a finer story in the history of the Metropolitan Police, I shall be pleased to hear it.\" Bush received the George Medal; also a Commissioner's High Commendation and \u00a315 from Bow Street Police Fund.", "link_mentions": {}}}
