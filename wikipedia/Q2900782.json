The site near Lake Ram, in the Golan Heights, where the Venus of Berekhat Ram was discovered, probably belongs to this cultural horizon. This statue is considered, by some, to be the earliest artistic representation of the human form. One of the human fossils from this period is the Galilee Skull\u2013part of a skull discovered by Francis Turville-Petre in Mugharet el-Zuttiyeh, in Nahal Amud\u2013which is considered today to be the skull of a Homo heidelbergensis or of an early Homo Sapiens.

Nicknamed \"Moshe\" and dating to circa 60,000 BP, the skeleton preserved a large part of one individual's torso (vertebral column, ribs and pelvis). The cranium and most of the lower limbs were missing. The hyoid bone was also preserved, and was the first Neanderthal hyoid bone found.Mithen, S.(2006).

Auden sent a copy of \"The Chase\" to Isherwood, who suggested revisions that eventually transformed the play into The Dog Beneath the Skin. In \"The Fronny\" the central character (who is referred to as \"Fronny\" in the surviving fragments) was apparently based loosely on the archaeologist Francis Turville-Petre, but the character of Sir Francis in The Chase and The Dog Beneath the Skin has no resemblance to Turville-Petre."]}, {"page": "Down There on a Visit", "response": ["Other characters include Mr Lancaster, Waldemar, Ambrose (based on Francis Turville-Petre), Hans, Aleko, Geoffrey, Paul (based on a real-life male prostitute, Denham Fouts), Augustus, Ronny and Ruthie."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Turville-Petre", "response": ["Gabriel Turville-Petre was born at his family's ancestral home of Bosworth Hall, Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire on 25 March 1908.

This culture was without pottery and typically used large axes for chopping lumber, cutting wood and felling trees such as the cedars of Lebanon in preparation for the domestication of emmer wheat and the Neolithic Revolution. Levels II and III of Turville-Petre's excavations revealed deposits of flints and potsherds. The pottery was later in date that the Heavy Neolithic material, which included heavy blades (picks, adzes, borers and flake scrapers), massive flake scrapers, and pieces with denticulation, all similar to those found at Shemouniyeh and Wadi Fa'rah.
