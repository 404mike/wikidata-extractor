He designated the two phases as solitaria and gregaria. These are also referred to as statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory.

Since Platymorpha is a genus of the leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) already described in 1888, James Abram Garfield Rehn and his son John William Holman Rehn described the genus in 1939 new as Planispectrum. In relation to Phasmatodea, Platymorpha is therefore a senior synonym to Planispectrum. As type species they set Planispectrum cochinchinensis. Also the Russian entomologist Boris Uvarov noticed the synonymy of Platymorpha. Unaware of the renaming by Rehn and Rehn, he renamed the genus to Platyphasma in 1940. This name is therefore a junior synonym for the older name Planispectrum. A species also described by Redtenbacher in 1906 as Datames pusillus was transferred to the genus Planispectrum by Oliver Zompro in 2004. Zompro also described three other species. Two of them based on relatively freshly collected material and the third (Planispectrum javanense) after examining the type material of Planispectrum bengalensis based on a paralectotype. The last species to be described was Planispectrum hainanensis in 2008, initially in the genus Pylaemenes. It was transferred to Planispectrum by George Ho Wai-Chun in 2013."]}]}}
