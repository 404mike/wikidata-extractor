The favourite gifts for little girls were dressable dolls, with flexible limbs and rolling eyes, that miraculously squeaked when laid down or picked up. The choice for little boys lay between red-jacketed lead soldiers who stood on the ramparts of a fort with a drawbridge, and vertical steam engines, that sometimes worked when the methylated-spirit lamp was lit under the boilers.A Terrace in the Sun, Cecil Roberts, , 1974"]}, {"page": "Temporary gentlemen", "response": ["Some temporary gentlemen went on to become leading literary figures of the period; as well as Mottram and Williamson, their ranks included J. B. Priestley, Cecil Roberts, Gerald Bullett and R. C. Sherriff. The temporary gentleman became a stock character in inter-war literature. H. F. Maltby's 1919 play A Temporary Gentleman focused on Walter Hope, a junior warehouse clerk who was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps. The character fails to adjust to the post-war reality, being too \"swollen-headed\" to return to his pre-war job; the story was made into a film in 1920. Maltby wrote from experience as a 35-year-old artillery NCO serving under officers who \"were so obviously lower-middle class and suburban and gave themselves such airs and graces. I wondered what would happen to them when the war was over. I could see a terrible debunking before them\". The poet Richard Aldington considered the characterisation of Hope as too simplistic for a time when thousands of ex-officers were unemployed, sleeping rough and willing to take whatever work they could. Aldington wrote The Case of Lieutenant Hall, a fictional short story about a temporary officer who commits suicide after seeing Maltby's play."]}, {"page": "William Joyce", "response": ["In 1932 Joyce joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF) under Sir Oswald Mosley and swiftly became a leading speaker, praised for the power of his oratory.
