This was the first time a national anthem had been sung at a sporting event. The strongly contested game was decided by a single score. In the twenty-fifth minute, Welsh scrum half Dicky Owen released the ball to Cliff Pritchard, who received the ball at ankle level before darting forward.

Normally Owen would play in partnership with Dick Jones, but during this period Jones was suffering a long-term injury and Morgan developed a natural understanding of Owen's play, and through this became a prolific try scorer. In 1905, Morgan was chosen to play in the Newport team against the touring New Zealand All Blacks. The game that made Morgan as an international player was his club performance in 1908, when he was at the centre of excellent play against the Australians, in which Swansea won 6\u20130.
