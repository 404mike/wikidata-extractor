He was the MP for Belfast Falls in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and later the leader of the Republican Labour Party.\nIn 1927, Diamond was the main initiator and first chairman of O'Donnell's GAA. He later became chairman of Antrim GAA.Diamond was an active nationalist before the Second World War and in 1933 was sentenced to a month in jail for refusing to pay a fine given out for addressing an illegal rally in support of republican prisoners. The following year, he stood in the Belfast Central by-election as an \"Anti-Partition\" candidate.In 1944, Diamond became a founder member of the Socialist Republican Party.  He took the Belfast Falls seat at the 1945 Northern Ireland general election.  In 1949, no one else contested the seat, and he remained the Socialist Republican Party's only MP, but the party disbanded that year.  While most of its members joined the Irish Labour Party, Diamond held his seat, until 1964 as an independent standing as \"Republican Labour\".\nIn 1964, Diamond joined with Gerry Fitt to found the Republican Labour Party. He stood for the Westminster constituency of Belfast West in the October 1964 general election, but was defeated by James Kilfedder. The campaign was disfigured by riots after Ian Paisley attempted to lead a Unionist crowd up Divis Street to remove an Irish tricolour from the offices of Sinn F\u00e9in, who were supporting the candidacy of Billy McMillen. The riots galvanised the Unionist vote while the nationalist vote was split between Diamond and McMillen. Diamond alleged that the official Ulster Unionist Party had colluded in this.Diamond saw a strong challenge to his position from the resurgent Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) in the late 1960s, and was criticised for being inattentive to his constituents' needs. Paddy Devlin of the NILP, a former supporter of the reformists in the Belfast branch of the Irish Labour Party, defeated him in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election.\nIn 1970, Fitt left the Republican Labour Party to found the broader-based Social Democratic and Labour Party.  Paddy Kennedy assumed the leadership, but the party was in terminal decline and disbanded in 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gerry Fitt", "response": ["In 1962, he won a Stormont seat from the Ulster Unionist Party, becoming the only Irish Labour member.

In the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the two-seat Westminster county constituency of Londonderry was split into two single-seat county divisions. The use of \"Derry\" rather than \"Londonderry\" in their names was proposed by Frank Hugh O'Donnell, who said he thought that \"at the time when the London Companies were despairing of retaining their hold upon Derry this Amendment would be accepted by the House. The Amendment would be welcomed in the North of Ireland, where the county in question was always spoken of as Derry, and not as Londonderry.\" This amendment was defeated, on the basis that a county constituency name ought to match the official county name; but T.M. Healy then proposed keeping the county name but changing the division names, thus: Londonderry (North Derry division) and Londonderry (South Derry division). Only David Plunket opposed this, noting \"the City of Londonderry was spoken of both as Derry and Londonderry. The name of Derry was given when it was spoken of as a separate division of the county.\" The Stormont constituencies of North, South, Mid and City of Londonderry were so named by statute in 1929, although a 1935 Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland map uses \"Derry\" instead of \"Londonderry\" for these.
