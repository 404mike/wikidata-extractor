In June 1862, aged 31, he was appointed Professor of Civil Law at Edinburgh University, at a salary of \u00a3250 per annum, replacing Prof Archibald Campbell Swinton. This important new role in the university was brought about by the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1858 which created a new degree of LLB which was awarded as a postgraduate degree following receipt of an MA degree. The new component of \"Civil Law\" was based upon Roman Law which is a cornerstone of Scots Law, in comparison to English Law which hinges upon Norman Law.http://iuscivile.com/legacy/reprints/cairns.pdf"]}]}}
