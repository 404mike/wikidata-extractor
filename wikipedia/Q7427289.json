He was then named on the subs bench for Blackburn to cover from Mark Bunn when Paul Robinson picked up an injury. In February 2011, after Bywater and Saul Deeney picked up injuries, Fielding returned to Derby on loan. Though the deal was initially announced as being until the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Fielding's two month emergency loan deal with the club in October and November meant that he could only remain at the club for an additional month, with his second stay ending after the away fixture at Crystal Palace on 19 March 2011, though Fielding would train with the Derby squad for the remainder of the season."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["The draw for the third round of the FA Cup took place on 4 December 2005, and Manchester United were given an away tie with Conference National side Burton Albion.

The Brewers were the better team in the first half, with Phil Bardsley clearing headers off the line from Jon Shaw and skipper Darren Stride. United struggled on a heavy pitch, although Wayne Rooney twice forced saves from Burton goalkeeper Saul Deeney after coming on as a substitute.

Mark Dudley and Gary Mills were loaned out to Hinckley United and Solihull Moors respectively whilst both Jermaine Johnson and Henrik Ojamaa made one-month loan moves to Stafford Rangers. Young Serbian striker Aleksandar Prijovi\u0107 joined OB Odense on trial, where he impressed with a goal in a trial match.

After Gilles Sunu equalised, Reading retook the lead before Deeney gave away a penalty in the 41st minute and was sent off. With no goalkeeper left on the bench, Deeney was replaced in goal by midfielder and captain Robbie Savage. Reading missed their penalty, but scored twice in the second half to send Derby to a 4\u20131 defeat. With no goalkeepers available, Clough moved swiftly to capture Liverpool's David Martin on a month's loan. Martin made his debut in a 1\u20132 defeat at Doncaster Rovers and kept his place for a 2\u20132 draw with Middlesbrough which put Derby firmly in the relegation dogfight after just one win in six games. Bywater returned the following game and, in his next three appearances earned consecutive Championship Team of the week appearances after keeping clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday and in a 1\u20130 win over 4th placed Leicester City. He was joined by Chris Porter in the Team of the week for the win over Leicester and these results, coupled with a 1\u20131 draw at Q.P.R. saw Derby finish March on a four match unbeaten run and 9 points clear of the relegation zone with just six games to play.", "Looking towards the 2010\u201311 season, Alan Tomlinson, who had been with the club as Head Physio since December 2007, left the club to \"pursue other interests.\" The club announced it had agreed a deal to sign ADO Den Haag utility player Danny Buijs once the Dutch football season had finished, and gave Russell Anderson, whose contract expired at the end of the season, a new two-year deal.

Fielding eventually joined ahead of the Preston North End game on an emergency four-week deal. Saul Deeney was then ruled out of contention due to being placed on compassionate leave due to a serious family illness, leading to a recall for Ross Atkins from his loan spell at Tamworth, with James Severn instead sent to the club as a compensatory replacement.
