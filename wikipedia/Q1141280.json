The \"buzz\" is the excitement of playing on stage; \"cock\" is northern English slang meaning \"friend\". They thought it captured the excitement of the nascent punk scene, as well as having humorous sexual connotations following Pete Shelley's time working in a Bolton adult shop. Per the band, there is no \"the\" in Buzzcocks.", "Devoto left the band in 1977, after which Pete Shelley became the principal singer-songwriter. After releasing three albums, as well as the \"Singles Going Steady\" compilation, the band broke up in 1981 following a dispute with their then-record label, but reunited in 1989, since releasing six more albums.
