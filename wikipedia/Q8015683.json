Mitchell is best known for rising from humble origins to high rank, having joined the Navy in 1766 as an able seaman and died in 1816 as a vice-admiral. His service was highly varied, including a circumnavigation of the world, command of a ship at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797 and a period as Sir James Saumarez's flag captain. He was also rumoured to have once been flogged round the fleet for desertion, although no firm evidence of this has been discovered.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Mitchell", "response": ["William Mitchell may refer to:", "* William Mitchell (sculptor) (1925\u20132020), English sculptor and muralist", "* William Mitchell, former alias of actor Peter Finch", "* William Mitchell (barrister) (died 1937), Scottish Advocate and Liberal  politician", "* William Mitchell (Burnley MP) (1838\u20131914), Conservative MP for Burnley, 1900\u20131905", "* William Mitchell (congressman) (1807\u20131865), Congressman from Indiana", "* William Mitchell (Huntingdonshire MP) (c. 1703\u20131745), Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire, 1741\u20131745", "* William Mitchell (North Dakota) (1830\u20131890), North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction", "* William Mitchell (died 1823), Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle, 1796\u20131799", "* William Mitchell (Canadian politician) (1851\u20131926), Canadian senator", "* William Mitchell (Australian politician) (1850\u20131923), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* William Mitchell (RAF officer) (1888\u20131944), senior Royal Air Force commander and former Black Rod", "* William Mitchell (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1745\u20131816), Royal Navy admiral", "* William Mitchell (mathematician), set theorist, see J\u00f3nsson cardinal", "* William Mitchell (physicist) (1925\u20132002), Oxford physicist who helped pioneer neutron scattering", "* William Mitchell (cricketer, born 1859) (1859\u20131929), English cricketer", "* William Mitchell (philosopher) (1861\u20131962), University of Adelaide Professor, Vice Chancellor and Chancellor, 1942\u20131948", "* William Mitchell (missionary) (1803\u20131870), Anglican priest who established religious services in the Swan River Colony", "* William Mitchell (Scottish entrepreneur) (1781\u20131854), co-founder of the Alloa Coal Company", "* William Mitchell College of Law, law school named for William B.
