A termination petition was first submitted to Parliament by Charles Walker, later Cornwall-Legh, who held a one-twelfth claim to the title, in 1926. Later that year the House of Lords select committee chaired by Lord Sumner recommended that inter alia no abeyance should be considered which is longer in date than 100 years and that only claims where the claimant lays claim to at least one third of the dignity be considered.  Cornwall-Legh died in 1934, and his son, Charles Legh Shuldham Cornwall-Legh CBE, was permitted a relaxation of these conditions in 1936 as the original claim had begun before the parliamentary committee reported.  After grants for extensions of time for various reasons submitted by Charles Cornwall-Legh, in 1989 the House of Lords Committee for Privileges, chaired by Lord Wilberforce, examined his legal right to the peerage title, Baron Grey de Codnor, of Codnor in the County of Derbyshire. It found that although the first, second and third Barons were summoned to Parliament, there was no evidence that they sat in a properly constituted Parliament. Richard Grey, fourth Baron was summoned in 1397, and did sit, and they held that the barony should be dated from then. It was satisfied that all proper and possible enquiries had been made to trace the descendants of Lucy, Eleanor and Elizabeth, which included Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford (a descendant of Eleanor (Newport)). The abeyance was subsequently terminated by Elizabeth II in favour of the Cornwall-Legh family, descendants of Lucy (Lenthall), which succeeded in the title in 1989. It was held in the judgement of 1989 that the 2nd and 3rd Barons Grey of Codnor (of the 1299 creation) did not properly sit in Parliament after being summoned, and the barony was therefore dated 1397 after evidence was found that Richard Grey, known as the fourth Baron, did take his seat in Parliament.  The title had fallen into abeyance in 1496 on the death of Henry Grey, known as the seventh Baron, and after 493 years was terminated in the favour of Charles Cornwall-Legh CBE, thereafter fifth Baron after the redesignation of title holders.  the title is held by his son, the sixth Baron."]}, {"page": "False titles of nobility", "response": ["Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford, estimates these sellers having an income of US$2,918,520 per acre (about US$7.2 million per hectare) of poor land, which he suggests could probably be purchased for about US$100.The Earl of Bradford, Beware Buying British Titles on the Internet, Burke's Peerage & Gentry Some of these sellers enclose with the invalid deed a coat of arms; this is not authorised by the Lord Lyon, and so it is unlawful in Scotland to use it.
