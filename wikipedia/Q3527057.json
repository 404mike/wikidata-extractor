The following two seasons were moderate, but with the newly found spinning riches of John Mortimore and David Allen, Gloucestershire acquired the most formidable bowling attack in the country during the brilliant summer of 1959, with Cook \"making full use of his wealth of experience\". In this period Gloucestershire, as in the days of Parker, Goddard and Sinfield, often played three spinners, right up to the time when Cook retired in 1964. However, despite heading the first-class bowling averages for the only time in 1962, Cook's extreme weakness with the bat and in the field saw him left out of many matches even in that season and on grassier pitches the switch in emphasis to seam bowling made things even tougher for Cook as he grew older."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Johnny Wardle \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Vic Wilson (cricketer)", "response": ["Though he was by then far from guaranteed a place in the first team, Wilson survived the purge of Yorkshire's playing staff in 1958 which saw Johnny Wardle, Bob Appleyard and Frank Lowson leave the staff and a new young team take shape under the captaincy of Ronnie Burnet.

In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry.

While \"Typhoon\" Tyson is justly famed for simply blasting the opposition away, the nagging accuracy of Statham and Bailey and the increasing spin of Wardle and Appleyard all served to tie down and frustrate the Australian batsmen.

Even worse he was not replaced and the MCC travelled with only 16 men and two spinners, Laker and Lock. In 1956 Jim Laker had taken 46 wickets (9.60) against the Australians with his ferocious off-spin, still a record for an Ashes series. For Surrey he took 10/88 and 2/42 against the tourists, but at Old Trafford he took 9/37 and 10/53, a record for all First Class cricket. His Surrey \"spin twin\" was Tony Lock, a slow left arm bowler with a dangerous faster ball. He took only 15 wickets (22.46) wickets against Australia in 1956, but 34 wickets (7.47) against New Zealand in 1958. The selectors had had doubts about their effectiveness overseas and neither had been taken in 1954\u201355, but Laker would top the England Test and tour bowling averages. Lock would have a chequered tour; taking only 5 wickets (75.20) in the Tests, but 28 wickets (21.32) in the other First Class games. Ironically his faster ball that became embroiled him in the throwing controversy proved to be ineffective in the Tests. In the 1962\u201363 tour Lock would not be taken, but joined Western Australia and was instrumental in their defeat of the MCC and their rise in Sheffield Shield cricket. Belatedly the MCC sent John Mortimore to Australia by plane, an off-spinning all-rounder who was later kept out of the England team by the similar, but superior, skills of Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus.", "The MCC team suffered from a long list of injuries that affected their ability to contest the Ashes series, particularly as they only had a 16-man squad because Johnny Wardle was not replaced when he was dropped. When they Australian tour ended only 12 men were fit enough to proceed to the following tour in New Zealand, Bailey, Evans, Laker, Loader, Milton and Statham returning to England instead."]}, {"page": "1985 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 23 July \u2013 Johnny Wardle, cricketer (born 1923)"]}, {"page": "Wath Academy", "response": ["* Johnny Wardle (1934\u20131938), cricketer"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Of the players who went to the West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler.

Playfair was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series.

He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82.
