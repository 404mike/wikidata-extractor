Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen's Rd at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able to eavesdrop and hear the conversation which stated that the trustees were preparing to sell.Cartleton 1984 p19 Although with a price of \u00a340,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the college could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (\u00a310,000), cousin Francis Fry (\u00a35,000), Sir William Henry Wills (\u00a310,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (\u00a35,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families personal estate was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land."]}, {"page": "Royal West of England Academy", "response": ["*1897-1898 Alderman Francis Fry"]}, {"page": "Fry (surname)", "response": ["*Francis Fry (1803\u20131886), English businessman and bibliographer"]}, {"page": "Theodore Fry", "response": ["He was the son of Francis Fry, of Bristol, and his wife Matilda Penrose, daughter of Daniel Penrose.
