Having taught at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Michigan, he was assistant keeper (1929\u20131945) and then keeper (1945\u20131956) of the Department of Antiquities, Ashmolean Museum. He spent the Second World War as a temporary civil servant in the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Production. He was Director of the London Museum from 1956 to 1970, and then, following its merger with the Guildhall Museum, served as Acting Director of the Museum of London from 1965 to 1970.Harden was President of the Council for British Archaeology from 1950 to 1954; and twice Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, from 1949 to 1953 and from 1964 to 1967. He had been elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) in March 1944, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in July 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carthage", "response": ["The merchants of Carthage were in part heirs of the Mediterranean trade developed by Phoenicia, and so also heirs of the rivalry with Greek merchants. Business activity was accordingly both stimulated and challenged. Cyprus had been an early site of such commercial contests. The Phoenicians then had ventured into the western Mediterranean, founding trading posts, including Utica and Carthage. The Greeks followed, entering the western seas where the commercial rivalry continued. Eventually it would lead, especially in Sicily, to several centuries of intermittent war.Cf., Charles-Picard, Daily Life in Carthage (Paris 195; Oxford 1961, reprint Macmillan 1968) at 165, 171\u2013177.Donald Harden, The Phoenicians (New York: Praeger 1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 57\u201362 (Cyprus and Aegean), 62\u201365 (western Mediterranean); 157\u2013170 (trade); 67\u201370, 84\u201385, 160\u2013164 (the Greeks). Although Greek-made merchandise was generally considered superior in design, Carthage also produced trade goods in abundance. That Carthage came to function as a manufacturing colossus was shown during the Third Punic War with Rome. Carthage, which had previously disarmed, then was made to face the fatal Roman siege. The city \"suddenly organised the manufacture of arms\" with great skill and effectiveness. According to Strabo (63 BC \u2013 AD 21) in his Geographica:", "Regarding Phoenician writings, few remain and these seldom refer to Carthage. The more ancient and most informative are cuneiform tablets, ca. 1600\u20131185, from ancient Ugarit, located to the north of Phoenicia on the Syrian coast; it was a Canaanite city politically affiliated with the Hittites. The clay tablets tell of myths, epics, rituals, medical and administrative matters, and also correspondence.Glenn E. Markoe, Phoenicians (London: British Museum, Berkeley: University of California 2000) at 21\u201322 (affinity), 95\u201396 (economy), 115\u2013119 (religion), 137 (funerals), 143 (art).David Diringer, Writing (London: Thames and Hudson 1962) at 115\u2013116. The Ugarit tablet were discovered in 1929.Allen C. Myers, editor, The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids: 1987) at 1027\u20131028. The highly valued works of Sanchuniathon, an ancient priest of Beirut, who reportedly wrote on Phoenician religion and the origins of civilization, are themselves completely lost, but some little content endures twice removed.Markoe, Phoenicians (2000) at 119. Eusebius of Caesarea (263\u2013339), the Church Historian, quotes the Greek of Philo of Byblos whose source was the Phoenician writings of Sanchuniathon. Some doubt the existence of Sanchuniathon.Cf., Attridge & Oden, Philo of Byblos (1981); Baumgarten, Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos (1981). Cited by Markoe (2000). Sanchuniathon was said to have lived in the 11th century, which is considered doubtful.Donald Harden, The Phoenicians (New York: Praeger 1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 83\u201384.Sabatino Moscati, Il Mondo dei Fenici (1966), translated as The World of the Phoenicians (London: Cardinal 1973) at 55. Prof. Moscati offers the tablets found at ancient Ugarit as independent substantiation for what we know about Sanchuniathon's writings.  Much later a Phoenician History by Philo of Byblos (64\u2013141) reportedly existed, written in Greek, but only fragments of this work survive.Soren, Khader, Slim, Carthage (1990) at 128\u2013129.The ancient Romanized Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (37\u2013100s) also mentions a lost Phoenician work; he quotes from a Phoenician History of one \"Dius\". Josephus, Against Apion (c.100) at I:17; found in The Works of Josephus translated by Whiston (London 1736; reprinted by Hendrickson, Peabody, Massachusetts 1987) at 773\u2013814, 780. An explanation proffered for why so few Phoenician works endured: early on (11th century) archives and records began to be kept on papyrus, which does not long survive in a moist coastal climate.Glenn E. Markoe, Phoenicians (Univ.of California 2002) at 11, 110. Of course, this also applies to Carthage. Cf., Markoe (2000) at 114. Also, both Phoenicians and Carthaginians were well known for their secrecy.Strabo (c. 63 B.C. \u2013 A.D. 20s), Geographica at III, 5.11.\"He knows all lingos, but pretends he doesn't. He must be Punic; need we labor it?\" From Poenulus at 112\u2013113, by the Roman playwright Plautus (c. 250\u2013184).

One tool that helped them was the sounding weight.  This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with tallow inside attached to a very long rope.  When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine how deep the waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land.  Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were.  The Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator is known to have sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar c. 500 BC and explored the Atlantic coast of Africa.  There is general consensus that the expedition reached at least as far as Senegal.Donald Harden, The Phoenicians, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, page 168 There is a lack of agreement whether the furthest limit of Hanno's explorations was Mount Cameroon or Guinea's 890-metre (2910-foot) Mount Kakulima.B.H. Warmington, op. cit., page 79 Nonetheless, Hanno's maritime travels limit may have been further north, as there are well documented difficulties with the return travel from the regions south of cape Chaunar, which, up to the early 15th century, \"had hitherto been the non plus ultra or impassable limit of European navigation\" John Locke, \"The works of John Locke: in nine volumes, Volume 9\" The history of navigation, p. 385, Printed for C. and J.

In 1959 a detailed account of the Lycurgus Cup was published by Donald Harden and Jocelyn Toynbee, which also discussed diatreta as a group, effectively for the first time.

The head is a close imitation of obverse dies from the mint of Syracuse depicting the goddesses Kore and Arethusa. Some scholars have argued that this was simply an imitation of a trusted design and no specific identity was intended for the figure. Other scholars have argued that it should be interpreted as a depiction of the goddess Kore. In support of this is the fact that Demeter and Kore were worshipped in Carthage, where they had had a temple since 396 BC. Furthermore, the one significant change made to the image is the addition of a wreath made out of sheafs of wheat, which might have been intended to make clear that the image depicted Kore, as goddess of grain and the harvest. Donald Harden argued that the head should be interpreted as the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, \"in the guise of the Sicilian Persephone [i.e. Kore],\" a position which is supported by many other scholars Kenneth Jenkins suggests that this could be linked with the interpretation of the horse on the reverse as a symbol of Baal Hammon, since one of Tanit's main epithets in Carthage was Pene Ba'al (face of Ba'al), but he concedes that evidence that the Carthaginians identified Tanit with Kore is \"lacking.\""]}, {"page": "Donald Benjamin Harden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Harden"]}]}}
