They are chiefly accounts of cases with copious comments discussing in almost every instance the views and discoveries of others, without any important original contribution of his own. At the same time these memoirs are very thoroughly done, containing numerous literary references, and not wanting in useful practical hints. Begbie's only separate book was 'A Handy Book of Medical Information and Advice, by a Physician,' published anonymously in 1860, of which a second edition appeared in 1872. He wrote thirteen articles in Reynolds's 'System of Medicine,' of which perhaps the most important were on 'Local Paralysis from Nerve Disease,' 'Dysentery,' 'Fatty Liver,' 'Cancer of the Liver,' &c.
