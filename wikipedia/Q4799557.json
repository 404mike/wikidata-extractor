He released three solo albums and was responsible for introducing the work of musician Mike Oldfield to Virgin Records.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Oldfield", "response": ["By mid-1971, Oldfield had assembled a demo tape containing sections of a longform instrumental piece initially titled \"Opus One\". Attempts to secure a recording deal to record it professionally came to nothing. In September 1971, Oldfield, now a session musician and bassist for the Arthur Louis Band, attended recording sessions at The Manor Studio near Kidlington, Oxfordshire, owned by businessman Richard Branson and run by engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth. Branson already had several business ventures and was about to launch Virgin Records with Simon Draper. Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demos and took them to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week of recording time at The Manor, after which Oldfield had completed what became \"Part One\" of his composition, Tubular Bells. He recorded \"Part Two\" from February to April 1973. Branson agreed to release Tubular Bells as the first record on the Virgin label and secured Oldfield a six-album deal with an additional four albums as optional."]}, {"page": "Tubular Bells", "response": ["Late in 1971 Oldfield joined the band of Arthur Louis who were recording demos at The Manor Studio. The studio was being constructed in the former squash court of an old manor house in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, which had recently been bought by the young entrepreneur Richard Branson and which was being turned into a residential recording facility run by his music production team of Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth. Oldfield was shy and socially awkward, but struck up a friendship with the two producers after they heard his guitar playing. Oldfield asked Newman to listen to his demos, but they were in his Tottenham flat, so one of Louis' roadies drove Oldfield to London and back to retrieve them. Newman and Heyworth made a copy of the demos, and promised Oldfield that they would speak to Branson and his business partner Simon Draper about them. After the album was released, Newman said he preferred the demo versions: \"They were complete melodies in themselves \u2013 with intros and fade-outs or ends. I liked them very much and was a little nonplussed when Mike strung them all together.\""]}, {"page": "Arthur Lewis", "response": ["*Arthur Louis (1950\u20132014), musician whose surname is pronounced lu\u02d0\u026as (Lewis)"]}, {"page": "Gene Chandler", "response": ["Later that year, Chandler recorded the album Gene and Jerry: One on One with fellow Chicago artist Jerry Butler.
