At Felbrigg Hall, a short film narrated by Stephen Fry stated that Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer had been widely known to be homosexual, though others claimed that this was only known by his close friends. Two of Ketton-Cremer's godchildren criticised the decision, claiming that a public outing would have been against Ketton-Cremer's wishes and accusing the Trust of using their godfather to generate publicity."]}]}}
