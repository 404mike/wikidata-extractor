Oliver Heywood's great-grandfather, Benjamin Heywood, was one of the family that had lived in Liverpool, where they owned a shipping company in the 1700s. This transported goods made in Manchester to West Africa, where they were traded for African slaves who were then taken to Barbados. There the slaves were traded in turn for sugar and cotton, which were landed in Liverpool on the ships' return voyage. The slave trade was lucrative but eventually recognised as unscrupulous. It was from this activity that Benjamin Heywood had been able to establish the family bank in Manchester in 1788.", "In 1845, Heywood joined his father's banking company, called Sir Benjamin Heywood & Co.. In 1847, he was made a partner in the company, as also later were his three younger brothers.

Despite Heywood's father's political legacy and his own public record of charity and public service, Heywood never took a career in politics seriously. Heywood was admired for his subtle disposition and his high qualities of competence and generosity. It was only natural that Heywood was offered the parliamentary seat for Salford as the liberal candidate on multiple occasions; he turned the whole proposition down, flattered."]}, {"page": "List of people from Manchester", "response": ["* Benjamin Heywood (1793\u20131865) prominent Manchester citizen, philanthropist and politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: H", "response": ["*Benjamin Heywood"]}, {"page": "Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Benjamin Heywood"]}, {"page": "Heywood (surname)", "response": ["* Benjamin Heywood (1793\u20131865), 1st Baronet, English banker and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Sir Benjamin Heywood, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benjamin Heywood"]}, {"page": "William Gaskell", "response": ["Gaskell was the assistant minister of Cross Street Chapel in Manchester from 1828 to 1854, and senior minister thereafter, a position he held until his death.A Brief History of Cross Street Chapel Retrieved before 10 December 2016.
