He was the first ever captain of the English cricket team in a Test match, captaining two Tests against Australia in 1876\u201377, losing the first, but winning the second.\nLillywhite was born in Westhampnett in Sussex, the son of a brickmaker, John Lillywhite. In the 1861 census the 19 year old James' profession is given as Tile Maker. He was the nephew of William Lillywhite, and so cousin to William's sons, James Lillywhite senior, John, Fred and Harry. Lillywhite is termed \"junior\" in sources to differentiate between him and his cousin James senior. He became a professional cricketer, and played first-class cricket for Sussex from 1862 and 1883. He played one final first-class match in 1885. Before the pre-Ashes Test-playing tour to Australia in 1876\u201377, Lillywhite also joined tours to North America in 1868 in a team led by Edgar Willsher, to Australia in 1873\u201374 in a team led by W.G. Grace. He also joined three further tours to Australia in teams led by Alfred Shaw, in 1881\u201382, 1884\u201385 and 1886\u201387.", "link_mentions": {}}}
