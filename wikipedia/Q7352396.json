He had an illustrious Junior International career winning individual Youth Olympic and Junior European medals. He dominated the medley disciplines for over four consecutive years as Senior British Champion and multiple record holder. Robin's 400m medley SC British record stood for six years. \nAs a Senior International, Francis was a two-time European silver medallist in the 400 metre individual medley (2001, 2003).  He also won silver at the 2004 World Championships in the same event. His 2001 performance was the fifth fastest in history and ranked him second in the world. As a result he was awarded with the prestigious 'Best International Newcomer' Award. He was consistently ranked inside the top two by the FINA world rankings and in 2003 went underneath the long standing European SC record held by Dutch great Marcel Wouda. Olympic and World Record holder Lazlo Czech set the new record by narrowly beating Francis.\nAt the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona, Francis was drafted in at short notice to compete in the men's 4 x 200-metre freestyle relay. He posted the fastest team split of 1.48.53 helping his team finish sixth and achieve Great Britain a place on the 2004 Olympic programme.\nAt the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Francis competed in the men's 200-metre individual medley, reaching the semi-final, and the 400-metre individual medley finishing 12th. He chose not to compete in the men\u2019s 4x200m freestyle at the Olympic trials as the event clashed with his individual ones. The men\u2019s team ended up placing fourth.\nFrancis retired from swimming in 2006 at the age of 23 and turned his attention to strength and conditioning, coaching and mentoring. Francis has successfully headed programmes in South Africa and the UK, and spent four years at Kelly College (now Mount Kelly) developing and leading the Performance Squad both as a swimming and strength and conditioning coach. During this time he successfully coached Hannah Russell MBE to become World Champion and multi medallist in the 2013 IPC World Championships in Montreal, Canada. \nFrancis is a full blue recipient from the University of Bath where he resides with his daughter. He is currently on his third career as a qualified teacher, whilst leading Malmesbury Marlins Amateur Swimming Club as their Head Coach.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre individual medley", "response": ["| 12 || 4 || 7 ||align=left| Robin Francis ||align=left|  || 4:18.34 || "]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metre individual medley", "response": ["| 12 || 7 || 2 ||align=left| Robin Francis ||align=left|  || 2:01.57 || Q", "| 8 || 7 ||align=left| Robin Francis ||align=left|  || 2:03.85 || "]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left rowspan=2|Robin Francis"]}, {"page": "2003 European Short Course Swimming Championships", "response": ["|Robin Francis"]}, {"page": "2004 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)", "response": ["|400 m  ||  Oussama Mellouli || 4:07.02 ||  Robin Francis || 4:08.06 ||  Eric Shanteau || 4:08.94"]}, {"page": "Oussama Mellouli", "response": ["At the 2004 Olympics he finished 5th in the 400 IM, setting the African Record in the process.
