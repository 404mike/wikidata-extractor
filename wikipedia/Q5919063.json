Barton's batting style is unknown.  He was born at Dartford, Kent.\nBarton made a single first-class appearance the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex at Lord's in 1856.  In the Gentlemen of England's first-innings, Barton was dismissed for 12 runs by Tom Wills, with the team making a total of 195.  The Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex made 91 in their first-innings and were made to follow-on in their second, making 168 all out.  This left the Gentlemen of England with a target of 65, which they reached with 8 wickets to spare.  The following year he made a second first-class appearance for Sussex against Surrey at The Oval.  Surrey made 166 in their first-innings, with Sussex replied poorly in their first-innings, making just 35, with Barton being dismissed for a duck by George Griffith.
