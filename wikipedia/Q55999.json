In 1905, he attended the 14th Universal Peace Congress in Lucerne, during rising tensions between France and Germany. He defused tensions in the congress by crossing the floor and shaking hands with German pacifist Ludwig Quidde. This was his last recorded event, moments before his death. A year later, he attended the 15th Universal Peace Congress in Milan, alongside delegates from across Europe and the United States like Felix Moscheles and Bertha von Suttner. Recognising the popularity of peace activism, Passy remarked in 1909 that \"the influence of these international [peace congresses] increases ... from year to year; it becomes more and more evident that they are taken seriously in the highest quarters\"."]}, {"page": "Ignaz Moscheles", "response": ["Much of what is known about Moscheles's life is derived from the biography, with selections from his diaries and correspondence, written after his death by his wife, Charlotte, and published in Germany in 1872; an English edition appeared the following year. The book also gives lively portraits of his era and of his musical contemporaries.C. Moscheles (1873), 2 vols. The diaries themselves are lost.

There, having been heard by Paderewski, Mark made a debut at the old Princes Hall in July 1890. This was a success, and there was another concert there, and a tour of the provinces. The family was too poor to turn down these opportunities, though they would gladly have protected the boy from public life. As a child he was billed as Max Hambourg. He was invited into the circle of the painter Felix Moscheles (son of the pianist Ignaz Moscheles), in London, where he often met Oscar Wilde, Bernard Shaw, Ellen Terry and others. It was in this period that he became tired of elderly ladies wanting to kiss him, and permitted them to do so only in exchange for a large box of chocolates.Brook 1947, 158-159. In 1890 Shaw, hearing him play, felt that the Lyric Theatre was merely exploiting children, but late in 1891 he was admiring his performance of Bach at the Steinway Hall and wrote that, with suitable training, \"this Russian lad might astonish the world some day.\"Shaw 1932, i, 55, 292.", "In 1895 Hambourg began his first world tour (aged 16), beginning in Australia, where in (Sydney) he was asked to prolong his stay by six weeks. Returning to London, he deputized for Paderewski at a Philharmonic Society concert playing Anton Rubinstein's Piano Concerto No. 4 in D minor. He first appeared in Paris in 1896, and after that in Brussels and Berlin. He went to the United States in the latter part of 1898, making his New York debut under William Gericke with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and going on to tour the US. He then returned to London, and in 1901 made his first appearances at the Queen's Hall Proms under Henry Wood. Over the next four years he made another American tour and made visits to Poland, Russia and Germany. (He had met Lenin through Felix Moscheles in London in 1900). In 1906 he made a month-long concert visit to South Africa, taking his own piano by precarious means across the Veldt to one remote location. He first toured in Canada in 1909 and later became friends with the Canadian pianist Harold Bradley.Brook 1947, 160-161."]}, {"page": "Rosa Corder", "response": ["Corder was the daughter of  Micah Corder (1808\u201388), a London merchant, and Charlotte Hill.

The immediate context of the \"affair\" was, however, his falling-out with the group often known as the 'Muswell Hill brigade', around William Henry Ashurst. This occurred at some time during the middle of 1856. Orsini was a paid agent of Mazzini, but there was a terminal quarrel over some remarks he had made about Emilie Hawkes, a daughter of Ashurst, which were read by James Stansfeld, married to another of the daughters. According to Felix Moscheles, Stansfeld was opening Mazzini's letters by arrangement while Mazzini was out of the country; Orsini challenged Stansfeld to a duel.Felix Moscheles, Fragments of an Autobiography (2010), p. 129; Google Books. By 1857 Orsini was well known to have broken away and no longer claimed to be a \"Mazzinian\".E.g.
