In July, midfielder Trevor Quow joined from Peterborough United for a transfer fee of \u00a38,500. The following month, Gillingham signed Howard Pritchard, a winger who had made one appearance for the Welsh national team in 1985, from Bristol City for a fee of \u00a322,500. Defender Graham Pearce and midfielder Mel Eves arrived from Brighton & Hove Albion and Sheffield United respectively on free transfers, and the club paid semi-professional club Welling United a fee of \u00a33,000 to sign winger Dave Smith.  Defender Paul Haylock signed for \u00a325,000 from Norwich City, having rejected a new contract shortly after helping the team win the Second Division championship. Several players left the club, including defender Mel Sage, one of the club's most promising young players, who joined Derby County of the Second Division for a fee of \u00a360,000.  Gillingham had hoped for a significantly higher fee, but with the two clubs unable to agree on terms, the transfer fee had to be set by an independent tribunal. Karl Elsey came close to leaving the club, but failed to agree a contract with Reading and so remained at Gillingham. The team prepared for the new season with several friendly matches, including a testimonial match for the long-serving Weatherly, for which Tottenham Hotspur of the First Division provided the opposition.  The team retained the first-choice kit worn in the previous season of blue shirts with a white panel down each side.  The second-choice shirts to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition changed from plain red to white with a blue zig-zag band across the chest."]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players", "response": ["|Paul Haylock"]}, {"page": "Haylock", "response": ["*Paul Haylock (born 1963), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1987 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|2||Paul Haylock", "Gillingham took the lead in the 17th minute against the run of play.  Paul Haylock played a cross towards the edge of the Swindon penalty area which Karl Elsey struck on the volley into the net past a static Digby.  Swindon's Kamara sustained an injury during the first half and was replaced by Charlie Henry.  Bamber, Parkin and Henry all had headers saved by Kite in the Gillingham goal, who was described in The Guardian as \"unbeatable... for a good hour\".  Further goalbound efforts from both White and Henry struck the Gillingham crossbar before Swindon equalised just after the hour mark.  Henry controlled a pass from Berry with his chest and passed to Coyne, who took the ball past two Gillingham players before hitting a fierce shot into the goal from around .  Gillingham attacked again after Smith came on in place of Elsey, but Swindon's defenders closed down their opponents.

In the second leg, Chris Hutchings scored for Brighton midway through the first half to level the aggregate score.  Shortly afterwards, Gillingham goalkeeper Kite was sent off for fouling an opposition player, reducing his team to ten men.  As no substitute goalkeeper was available, defender Paul Haylock volunteered to take over in goal.  With his team-mates adopting a defensive strategy, Haylock conceded no goals during the remainder of the game; with the scores still level, a penalty shoot-out was required.  Both teams scored with their first four penalties; Gillingham scored their fifth and then Haylock saved Brighton's final kick to give Gillingham the victory.
