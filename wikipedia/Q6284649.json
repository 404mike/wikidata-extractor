He is currently the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture and, since 2008, Senior Fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. Specializing in Northern Renaissance and 19th-century art, Koerner is best known for his work on German art and Early Netherlandish painting.  After teaching at Harvard from 1989 to 1999 (as Professor since 1991), he moved to Frankfurt, where he was Professor of Modern Art History at the Goethe University, and to London, where he held professorships at University College London and the Courtauld Institute before returning to Harvard in 2007. His feature film The Burning Child, a documentary combining personal and cultural history, was released in 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "response": ["Because D\u00fcrer left autobiographical writings and was widely known by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented in several sources. After a few years of school, D\u00fcrer learned the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978\u201379), 10 A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 (Albertina, Vienna) \"when I was a child\", as his later inscription says. The drawing is one of the earliest surviving children's drawings of any kind, and, as D\u00fcrer's Opus One, has helped define his oeuvre as deriving from, and always linked to, himself.Joseph Koerner, \"The Moment of Self-Portraiture in Renaissance Art\", University of Chicago Press, 1993 Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps."]}, {"page": "Hieronymus Bosch", "response": ["Latterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in The Garden of Earthly Delights, both in the central panel (delights),Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31. and the right panel (hell).Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376. They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.  According to Joseph Koerner, some of the cryptic qualities of the artist's work is due to his special focus on social, political, and spiritual enemies, whose symbolism is, by nature, obscure because it is intended to conceal or to harm.Koerner (2016), 179-222.

James Lieberman and Robert Kramer wrote in an introduction to a collection of letters between Freud and the psychoanalyst Otto Rank that Rank was impressed by The Interpretation of Dreams when he read it in 1905, and was moved to write a critical reanalysis of one of Freud's own dreams. They suggested that it may have been partly this reanalysis that brought Rank to Freud's attention. They noted that it was with Rank's help that Freud published the second edition of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1909. The neuropsychoanalyst Mark Blechner argued in Contemporary Psychoanalysis that even if one does not agree with Freud's theories, The Interpretation of Dreams remains a valuable record of dream texts and an analysis of the mental operations that dreams demonstrate.Blechner, M.
