The rendition of the song contained extra disco style, and Lipa performed sweaty aerobics choreography with dancers dressed in neon primary-coloured workout gear.

Following the performance, the Blessed Madonna performed a Club Future Nostalgia DJ mix that included a salsa remake of \"Boys Will Be Boys\" based on Zach Witness' remix, Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" (2005), and \"Cosmic Girl\" (1996) by Jamiroquai.
