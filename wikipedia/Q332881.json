Author Gilbert Chase writes that it is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns\".Chase, p. 181. Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10\u00a0million times annually.", "The general impact of Olney Hymns was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language, expressing his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in Olney Hymns are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.Benson, p. 339. As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in first person, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6. Several of Newton's hymns were recognised as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them), while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.Benson, p. 338. Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.Aitken, p. 226."]}, {"page": "August 30", "response": ["*1942 \u2013 Jonathan Aitken, Irish-British journalist and politician, Minister for Defence Procurement"]}, {"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Jonathan Aitken and the Paris Ritz Hotel bill allegations, and his subsequent conviction for perjury after his failed libel action against The Guardian, resulting in Aitken being only the third person to have to resign from the Privy Council in the 20th century.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken, subsequently held face to face discussions with the intelligence agency directors to assess further savings in the wake of Quinlan's review. Aldrich (2010) suggests that Sir John Adye, the then Director of GCHQ performed badly in meetings with Aitken, leading Aitken to conclude that GCHQ was \"suffering from out-of-date methods of management and out-of-date methods for assessing priorities\". GCHQ's budget was \u00a3850\u00a0million in 1993, (\u00a3 as of ) compared to \u00a3125\u00a0million for the Security Service and SIS (MI5 and MI6). In December 1994 the businessman Roger Hurn was commissioned to begin a review of GCHQ, which was concluded in March 1995. Hurn's report recommended a cut of \u00a3100\u00a0 million in GCHQ's budget; such a large reduction had not been suffered by any British intelligence agency since the end of World War II. The J Division of GCHQ, which had collected SIGINT on Russia, disappeared as a result of the cuts. The cuts had been mostly reversed by 2000 in the wake of threats from violent non-state actors, and risks from increased terrorism, organised crime and illegal access to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons."]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Archer", "response": ["*Jonathan Aitken \u2014 Archer's contemporary, another Conservative politician imprisoned for perjury."]}, {"page": "Mohamed Al-Fayed", "response": ["In 1994, in what became known as the cash-for-questions affair, Fayed revealed the names of MPs he had paid to ask questions in parliament on his behalf, but who had failed to declare their fees.
