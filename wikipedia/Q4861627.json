In 1931 he joined the London Artists' Association and then, two years later, the London Group. In 1934, Coldstream joined the GPO Film Unit to make documentary films with John Grierson. During his time with the GPO, Coldstream worked alongside W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten and Barnett Freedman but also continued to paint. In 1937, with some financial support from Kenneth Clark, Coldstream returned to painting on a full-time basis. Later that year he co-founded the Euston Road School with Graham Bell, Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers, having previously been involved in the short-lived Objective Abstraction movement. Notable among his paintings of this period is the portrait of Inez Pearn (at that time married to Stephen Spender), which has been called \u2018a masterpiece of analytical realism\u2019 and which was said to have needed some forty sittings. Coldstream's earlier years were characterized by a dedicated engagement with socialist ideals, and by the pursuit of a non-elitist form of art. To this end, he supported the Mass Observation social survey of Britain and participated in their 1938 painting trip to Bolton."]}, {"page": "GPO Film Unit", "response": ["| The King's Stamp || William Coldstream || With Barnett Freedman"]}, {"page": "Royal Designers for Industry", "response": ["* Barnett Freedman, Graphics, 1949"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom commemorative stamps", "response": ["| Barnett Freedman"]}, {"page": "Ariel Poems (Faber)", "response": ["# The Wonder Night by Laurence Binyon, drawings by Barnett Freedman", "# News by Walter de la Mare, drawings by Barnett Freedman", "# Choosing A Mast by Roy Campbell, drawings by Barnett Freedman"]}, {"page": "Trekkie Parsons", "response": ["Known professionally as T.

Although three WAAC artists, Edward Bawden, Barnett Freedman and Edward Ardizzone, had been part of the British Expeditionary Force's retreat from France in 1940, the works they produced were small-scale representations of events in their immediate surroundings. WAAC therefore, quickly, commissioned two artists, Cundall and Richard Eurich to produce large panoramic reconstructions of the evacuation. As neither artist had witnessed the events at Dunkirk, they relied on published accounts, photographs, eyewitness reports and their own imaginations, to make their compositions. The two finished paintings were shown side by side at the National Gallery in August 1940. The two treatments were very different, and both had their critics and supporters. Most newspaper art critics, and Kenneth Clark, preferred Eurichs' symmetrical, more classical composition and criticised Cundall for having put too much unresolved detail into his picture, which seemed confused and unruly in places. The Royal Navy reproduced Eurich's painting on its official 1940 Christmas card, but many newspapers also reproduced a Ministry of Information photograph showing two servicemen at the National Gallery seemingly recognising elements of Cundall's composition.
