The evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes. This species also may have used fire to cook meat. Richard Wrangham suggests that the fact that Homo seems to have been ground dwelling, with reduced intestinal length, smaller dentition, \"and swelled our brains to their current, horrendously fuel-inefficient size\", suggest that control of fire and releasing increased nutritional value through cooking was the key adaptation that separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines."]}, {"page": "Primate", "response": ["Richard Wrangham stated that social systems of primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.

Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence. Mariner Books This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which \"follow\" in some sense castrated bellwethers), and many others."]}, {"page": "Primatology", "response": ["* Richard Wrangham"]}, {"page": "Irven DeVore", "response": ["Irven DeVore (October 7, 1934 \u2013 September 23, 2014) was an anthropologist and evolutionary biologist, and Curator of Primatology at  Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
