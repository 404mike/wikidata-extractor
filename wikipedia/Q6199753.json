Late that year Peter McWilliam was appointed manager. He became a significant and popular figure at the club, managing the team in two separate periods, both interrupted by world wars. The first significant signing by McWilliam was winger Fanny Walden, who was signed for a record \u00a31,700 in April 1913, later signings included goalkeeper Bill Jaques and right-back Tommy Clay.  McWilliam's record in the early years was poor, and Tottenham were bottom of the league at the end of the 1914\u201315 season when league football was suspended owing to the First World War that had started a year earlier.  During the war years, White Hart Lane was taken over by the government and turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment.

The match was described as \"disappointing to watch\" by The Times match reporter as the warm weather proved draining to both sides. Cardiff fell behind in the first five minutes of the match as Jimmy Cantrell gave Tottenham the lead. Although Cardiff enjoyed the majority of the chances, it took until midway through the second half to equalise through Jimmy Gill. Len Davies missed a late chance to win the match when he failed to react to a mistake by the opposition goalkeeper who had misjudged a cross and the game ended in a draw. Two days later, Cardiff recorded its first win of the season by defeating Aston Villa 3\u20130 at Ninian Park after a brace from Clennell and one goal from Billy Grimshaw. In the reverse fixture against Tottenham on 2 September, Cardiff suffered a 3\u20132 defeat in front of 50,000 spectators. Len Davies, the previous season's top goalscorer in all competitions, scored his first goals of the campaign with a brace. Despite taking the lead, three second half goals gave Tottenham an unassailable lead and Cardiff's efforts were further hampered by an injury to Clennell.
