He was a right-handed middle order batsman and joined Lancashire in 1955, being assured of a regular place in a strong batting line-up in only a few seasons, among them 1962, when he scored 2,125 runs at an average of more than 36. But by the mid-1960s, he was second eleven captain and an irregular first-class cricketer.Success with the second team, though, led to an unexpected call-up to be first team captain from 1968 and over the next five seasons, Bond led a previously under-achieving side to a run of success in one-day cricket competitions that has not been equalled. Intensively competitive, Bond led by example in the field and often made useful runs, normally batting at No 6 or lower. A mostly young team included future England cricketers such as Barry Wood, David Lloyd, Frank Hayes, Peter Lever and Ken Shuttleworth, and Lancashire recruited proven matchwinners in Clive Lloyd and Farokh Engineer as the overseas stars.\nBond's great ability was to get match-winning performances out of average county players in one-day games, and he was also a pioneer in using spin bowlers as an integral part of a one-day attack. Under him, Lancashire won the Sunday cricket league in its first two seasons, 1969 and 1970, and took the premier one-day trophy, then called the Gillette Cup, for three seasons in a row from 1970 to 1972, a feat that has not been equalled. The county challenged for the County Championship more strongly during Bond's captaincy than for many years, but he did not achieve the same success in the first-class game.\nBond was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for his captaincy in 1971. He also took a catch to dismiss Asif Iqbal, which turned the Gillette Cup Final that year. He retired from Lancashire after the 1972 season, then came back unsuccessfully to first-class cricket as player-manager of Nottinghamshire for a single season in 1974.\nIn the mid 1970s Bond moved to the Isle of Man, becoming head coach and cricket professional at King William's College. He also revealed himself as a fine table tennis player, leading the KWC team to the top of the Manx leagues and winning the Island championships. He returned to Old Trafford in the 1980s, as the manager of Lancashire.\nBond died on 11 July 2019.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Jack Bond"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The Lancashire side of the late 1960s and early 1970s, captained by Jack Bond and featuring the West Indian batsman Clive Lloyd, was successful in limited overs cricket, winning the Sunday League in 1969 and 1970 and the Gillette Cup four times between 1970 and 1975. Lancashire won the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1984, three times between 1990 and 1996, and the Sunday League in 1989, 1998 and 1999. They won the Twenty20 Cup for the first time in 2015.", "Jack Bond became Lancashire captain in 1968 and remained in the position until 1972. During his tenure, Lancashire performed well in the championship, finishing third in 1970 and 1971. His biggest triumph as captain was the five one day trophies he secured during his five-year captaincy. Farokh Engineer joined Lancashire in 1968, and Clive Lloyd joined in 1969; together Lloyd and Engineer helped establish Lancashire as one of the best one day sides in England. The silverware included a hat-trick of Gillette Cups (1970\u201372) and the Sunday League twice in successive seasons (1969\u20131970). Mainstays of the successful one day side included Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd, Barry Wood, Harry Pilling, Frank Hayes, Peter Lever, Ken Shuttleworth, David Hughes and Jack Simmons. In the Gillette Cup semi-final against Gloucestershire in 1971, David Hughes walked to the crease at 8.45pm and hit 24 from an over in near darkness to win the match. David Lloyd was captain from 1973 to 1977 and secured Lancashire's fourth Gillette Cup in 1975, and coming runners up in 1974 and 1976. However, in the late 1970s, the team that had been so dominant in the one day format began to break up. Despite boasting international players such as Lloyd and Engineer, Lancashire's first-class performances never matched the success of the limited overs team.

Lancashire's poor form was put into further perspective by the concurrent success of rivals Yorkshire, who won the title for the second successive season and for the sixth time in the last nine seasons. Statham was relieved of the Lancashire captaincy after the 1967 season and was replaced by Jack Bond who had been successful leading the Second XI.

He made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1964 but, due to limited opportunities, made the switch across the Pennines to Lancashire in 1966, where he became the first ever Yorkshireman to score two Roses hundreds (reaching his century with a six on both occasions) in the same season against his native county. In the 1970s, by winning more Man of the Match gold awards than any other player in the history of the game, he was arguably the most valuable player of a stellar Lancashire team that were the undisputed one day kings of English cricket. This record was finally broken by Graham Gooch. That side was captained by Jack Bond and included a number of international players: Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd and Peter Lever. This great Lancashire team won six trophies in six years \u2013 the Players County League in 1969, the John Player League in 1970 and the Gillette Cup in 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1975.
