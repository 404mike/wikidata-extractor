He spent most of his maturity with Queen Henrietta's Men, but finished his career with the King's Men. With the former company, he was one of \"those of principal note,\" according to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), one of the troupe's \"eminent actors.\"\nBowyer, the son of a John Bowyer, was christened on 20 September 1599 in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. He played a series of important roles through his career, including:\n\nBeaufort in James Shirley's The Wedding;\nKing John in Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda;\nVitelli in Philip Massinger's The Renegado;\nMr. Spencer in Thomas Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West;\nScipio in Thomas Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio.Robert Davenport dedicated his poem Too Late to Call Back Yesterday to Bowyer and Richard Robinson.\nThe Queen's Men were disrupted by a long theatre closure due to bubonic plague, which lasted from May 1636 to October 1637. Bowyer, along with three other veterans of that troupe, may have been with James Shirley at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin from 1637 to 1640.Bowyer was a member of the King's Men by  January 1640. He was one of the six members of that company who were named Grooms of the Chamber on 22 January 1641, indicating that he was a sharer in the troupe by that time.\nAs with many actors, his fortunes passed into eclipse after the London theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. According to a 1655 lawsuit filed by fellow Queen Henrietta's and King's Man Theophilus Bird, Bowyer, along with Thomas Pollard and other members of the King's Men, sold off the company's play scripts and costumes sometime after the theatres closed. By the time of Bird's suit, Bowyer was a decade dead.\nLittle is known of Bowyer's personal life. He and his wife christened and then buried a son named William in 1621; and they christened and buried another son of the same name the following year, 1622.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "King's Men (playing company)", "response": ["Unable to foresee the coming collapse of 1642, the King's Men undertook a major expansion around 1640. They brought in five new men as actors and sharers: William Allen, Theophilus Bird, Michael Bowyer, Hugh Clark, and William Robbins. All five were veterans of Queen Henrietta's Men; and all five were made Grooms of the Chamber on 22 January 1641, along with Stephen Hammerton. With Massinger's death in 1640, the troupe also needed a new house dramatist; James Shirley was recruited for the job. The company staged Shirley's The Cardinal in 1641, and his The Sisters in the Spring of 1642. The production of Shirley's next work, The Court Secret, was prevented by the theatre closure in September 1642."]}, {"page": "Queen Henrietta's Men", "response": ["In addition, the company included William Allen, Theophilus Bird (or Bourne), Hugh Clark, John Sumner, and Michael Bowyer. Bowyer handled leading-man roles; Hugh Clark was a boy player taking female roles, who later switched to adult male parts. Bird also played female roles for the company; he later married Beeston's daughter and was a successful actor both before and after the Interregnum. Allen and Sumner took significant supporting parts."]}, {"page": "Werburgh Street Theatre", "response": ["Shirley may also have brought some London actors with him to Dublin.
