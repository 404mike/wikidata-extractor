To support the film's Diamond Edition re-release in 2010, singer Jordin Sparks recorded an R&B version of \"Beauty and the Beast\", which was released on iTunes in September. A music video directed by Philip Andelman was included on the re-release as a bonus feature, part of the disc's \"Music and More\" segment. The video depicts Sparks performing \"Beauty and the Beast\" in a castle. In 2011, Sparks performed her rendition of the song live at the 30th anniversary of the televised Independence Day concert \"A Capitol Fourth\". The cover is believed to have initiated the singer's gradual transition from music to film. The compilation album Eurobeat Disney (2010) features a Eurobeat cover by singer Domino. In 2014, actors Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio covered \"Beauty and the Beast\" for the television special Backstage with Disney on Broadway: Celebrating 20 Years, which documents the development of eight of Disney's Broadway musicals. Both known for their roles in the television musical drama Nashville, Bowen, a fan of the film, arranged the cover herself to satisfy the documentary producers' vision, who \"were looking for performers who could offer unexpected interpretations of the [musicals'] familiar tunes\". Hilary Lewis of The Hollywood Reporter observed that Bowen and Palladio's rendition \"is more stripped down\" than the stage, Lansbury and Dion-Bryson versions. The song has been covered multiple times as part of the We Love Disney album series. We Love Disney France (2013) features a cover by singers Garou and Camille Lou while We Love Disney Australia (2014) features a cover by operatic pop vocal group Sole Mio (2014).
