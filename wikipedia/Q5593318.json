He appeared in 34 first-class matches in five seasons, but his career average as a batsman was only 12 and he reached 50 in an innings only twice.\nTripp made his debut for Somerset against the South Africans in 1955, making 2 and 13. It was enough, in a weak batting side, to keep him in the team for the next two matches, but he failed to reach double figures in either.\nIn 1956, he played fairly regularly in mid-season, but his only 50 \u2013 exactly 50 \u2013 came in a losing cause when promoted to open the second innings batting against Derbyshire. His 217 runs in the season at an average of 15.50 was his highest aggregate for any season.\nTripp's highest score came in 1957: batting at No 3, he made 62 against Essex at Colchester, \"driving and cutting attractively\", said Wisden. But the rest of the season produced only 76 further runs in 17 innings and he finished with an average of only eight runs per innings.\nIn both the 1958 and 1959 seasons, Tripp was called into the Somerset team for half a dozen matches, but he failed to pass 50 and only in his last season, 1959, did he suggest any consistency. He left the Somerset staff at the end of the 1959 season.\nDespite the relative lack of success at first-class level, Tripp was a heavy scorer for Somerset's second eleven in both the Minor Counties and Second Eleven Championship competitions, heading the county's averages in 1957 and 1959. After leaving Somerset, he played Minor Counties cricket for Devon.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clevedon", "response": ["*Graham Tripp (born 1932), county cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Graham Tripp (1955\u20131959) 34 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Tripp (surname)", "response": ["* Graham Tripp, British cricket player"]}]}}
