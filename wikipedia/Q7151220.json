He is noted for work in the field of spirituality, religion and modernity, with special reference to 'New Age' spiritualities of life. Recent publications and current research explore 'the sacred' and 'the secular'; transgressions of the secular (idealization, vitalization); 'life force', CAM, and 'spiritual humanism' (including 'third force' Sufism).\nHeelas was educated at St Catherine's College, Oxford (BA Geography; Diploma, with Distinction, in Social Anthropology) and Exeter College, Oxford (DPhil Anthropology).\nHe served as Professor in Religion and Modernity, Department of Religious Studies, Lancaster University, and as Senior Research Professor in the Sociology of Contemporary Spirituality, Department of Sociology, CROCUS research group, Erasmus University Rotterdam.\nHe spent over three years devoted to field research: Nepal (Sherpa religion), London (Programmes Ltd and Exegesis), Brazil (holistic Rio de Janeiro), India ('New Age' Madras and environs), Pakistan ('New Age'  Islamabad and environs) and lived in Nepal, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Pakistan for over six years.\nHeelas has helped found two journals: the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford and Cultural Values [now the Journal for Cultural Research]. He is also a member of Advisory Board of \"Open Theology\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Age", "response": ["The scholar of religion Paul Heelas characterised the New Age as \"an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life\" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of \"the same (or very similar) lingua franca to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be transformed.\" Similarly, the historian of religion Olav Hammer termed it \"a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs\" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are \"largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an air de famille\". According to Hammer, this New Age was a \"fluid and fuzzy cultic milieu\". The sociologist of religion Michael York described the New Age as \"an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities\" that are united by their \"expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential.\"", "In 1994, Christoph Bochinger published his study of the New Age in Germany, \"New Age\" und moderne Religion. This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995. In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business. That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published New Age Religion and Western Culture, a historical analysis of New Age texts; Hammer later described it as having \"a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age\". Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an ethnographic analysis of its practitioners."]}, {"page": "Spirituality", "response": ["The distinction between the spiritual and the religious became more common in the popular mind during the late 20th century with the rise of secularism and the advent of the New Age movement.

(2009) \"Spiritualities of Life: New Age Romanticism and Consumptive Capitalism\", Wiley critiques Possamai's view that the New Age is a consumer religion par excellence with a specific focus on individualistic preferences. He suggests that the practices of the New Age require a relational element that connects the Me to the We and thus are far less consumeristic and individualistic than Possamai argues. He argues that although Possamai denotes New Age as the consumer religion par excellence, he does little to discuss the actual processes that he thinks lead to this label.

Heelas says the search for metaphysical perfection and the view that mankind is malfunctioning are defining features of New Age spirituality, which Ezzy, Harrington and the religious studies scholar Joanne Pearson contrast with modern Pagan views. Using sociological classifications of world-affirming and world-rejecting religious movements, York says that modern Paganism and New Age represent two rival theologies, and that New Agers in particular tend to underestimate the \"Gnostic\u2013Pagan divide\", where New Age teachings are part of a Gnostic tradition that de-emphasises or negates the body and the physical existence."]}]}}
