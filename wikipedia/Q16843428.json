He is sometimes known as the father of British microbiology, but most of his work in microbiology, histology, and bacteriology was overshadowed during his life by his use of and apparently outspoken support for animal vivisection in physiological and medical experiments. His English was poor and during court questioning, many of the answers he provided were considered shocking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Physiological Society", "response": ["The Physiological Society was founded in 1876 as a dining society \"for mutual benefit and protection\" by a group of 19 physiologists, led by John Burdon Sanderson and Michael Foster, as a result of the 1875 Royal Commission on Vivisection and the subsequent 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act.The History of The National Anti-Vivisection Society (The National Anti-Vivisection Society)  Other founding members included: William Sharpey, Thomas Huxley, George Henry Lewes, Francis Galton, John Marshall, George Murray Humphry, Frederick William Pavy, Lauder Brunton, David Ferrier, Philip Pye-Smith, Walter H.

Charles Darwin and William Sharpey were elected as the society's first two Honorary Members. The society first met at Sanderson's London home.

While on a beach at Dunwich in 1885, he saved a girl from drowning and the local newspapers hoped that he would be awarded a gallantry medal by the Royal Humane Society.

Brown's Will stated the purpose of his bequest for \"founding, establishing and upholding an Institution for investigating, studying and, without charge beyond immediate expenses, endeavouring to cure maladies, distempers and injuries any quadrupeds or birds useful to man may be subject to, for and towards which purpose of founding, establishing and upholding such animal sanatory institution within a mile of either Westminster, Southwark or Dublin.\u201d The funds were transferred to the University of London in 1858 and accumulated interest till 1871 to a value of \u00a333,781. John Burdon-Sanderson was appointed as superintendent and because the Mortmain Act prevent purchase of land using the trust fund, a site of 1.5 acres was purchased with a \u00a32000 gift from John Cunliffe of Lombard Street and \u00a3500 from Burdon-Sanderson. The land was on Wandsworth Road. The institute was opened in 1871. The single large building had one basement floor accessible by a trapdoor from the apparatus room. A description by William Bulloch in 1925 notes: \"If one takes a tram from Westminster Bridge along the Embankment past \u201cLambeth Palace and Doultons and underneath an ugly railway bridge across the Wandsworth Road one reaches (No. 149) a small archway on which is graven the legend \u201cThe Brown Sanatory Institution founded 1871.\u201d On entering, one comes to a stable yard and, behind, a low building of one storey.

Among the researchers who worked at the institute was a Viennese scientist, Emanuel Edward Klein, sometimes considered the father of British bacteriology. The research he and his colleagues conducted at the Institution were published as in 1873 as the Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory along with John Burdon-Sanderson, Michael Foster, and Thomas Lauder Brunton. Their experiments included vivisection of animals, and following widespread protests, led to an enquiry in 1875, the Royal Commission on Vivisection for Scientific Purposes, chaired by Lord Cardwell and which resulted in the establishment of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. Activists writing in the press pointed out that a founding principle, \"kindness to animals is a general principle of the Institution\" was hardly followed."]}, {"page": "Heneage Gibbes", "response": ["Gibbes was born in Berrow, Somerset, where his namesake father was a minister while his mother Margaretta was the daughter of John Murray, an admiral in the Royal Navy.

At the age of fourteen, he rebelled against his father's plan to train for the clergy, and he left home to sail to the East Indies and returned only at the age of twenty one.

He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1879 and in 1887 he became Professor of Physiology and Normal and Morbid Histology at Westminster Hospital Medical School. He was a curator of the anatomical museum at King's College. He was a student of Emanuel Edward Klein and in 1884, the two were appointed to the British cholera commission and sent to India.

Having won an Open Entrance Scholarship, he began in 1885 his clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, where he learned bacteriology from Emanuel Edward Klein and pathology from Alfred Antunes Kanthack. In 1887 Andrewes graduated there BM (Oxon.) and qualified MRCS. At St Bartholomew's Hospital he was house physician to James Andrew and completed his medical education by a brief course of study in Vienna. Upon his return from Vienna Andrewes was appointed casualty physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital and later tutor in practical medicine. He was also assistant physician and pathologist to the Royal Free Hospital. He qualified MRCP in 1889. In 1891 he graduated DPH (Cantab). In the 1890s he graduated MD (Oxon.). In 1894 he was appointed assistant demonstrator of practical medicine as successor to Archibald Garrod. In 1897 the joint appointments of pathologist and lecturer on pathology at St Bartholomew's Hospital became vacant when Kanthack was appointed to the chair of pathology at the University of Cambridge. Andrewes succeeded him in these posts and continued in office for thirty years. In 1912 Andrewes's lectureship in pathology was raised by the University of London to a professorship."]}]}}
