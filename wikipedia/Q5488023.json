He was mistakenly described as a spin bowler in the Wisden match report.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 595. Opening the bowling in both innings with Brian Close, who was medium pace, Trueman took two for 72 and one for 22 as Cambridge were dismissed for 283 and 196 respectively. Yorkshire scored 317 for six declared and 164 for one so Trueman, who was number 11 in the order, did not bat. Trueman's first wicket was that of opening batsman Robert Morris, who was caught by Ellis Robinson for 19. In the second innings, Trueman bowled the future Sussex and England batsman Hubert Doggart for 23. Three other debutants that day who all became England players were Close and opening batsman Frank Lowson for Yorkshire; and Middlesex fast bowler John Warr for Cambridge. Many years later, Warr wrote the biographical piece about Trueman in Barclays World of Cricket.Warr, Barclays, p. 239. Trueman had match figures of six for 72 in his second match against Oxford, which Yorkshire lost by 69 runs. A month later, he took eight for 70 against the Minor Counties on his first appearance at Lord's, bowling unchanged through the second innings.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 270. Commenting on his first County Championship match, against Surrey at Park Avenue, Bradford, Wisden said that he bowled \"fast and with effect\".Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 582."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Frank Lowson"]}, {"page": "Brian Close", "response": ["In February 1949, Close underwent a medical examination with the British Army, but due to an injury he had suffered playing football his call-up was delayed by a few months, allowing him to continue into pre-season training with Yorkshire. His performance in pre-season was such that he was given a trial for the county in the two first-class matches against Cambridge and Oxford Universities. He made his debut on 11 May 1949, alongside Fred Trueman and Frank Lowson \u2013 all three went on to play for England. Close impressed the Yorkshire hierarchy enough for his trial to be extended into the County Championship season; Bill Bowes, one of Yorkshire's coaches, declared that he was the \"natural successor to the veteran all-rounder Frank Smailes\". Close continued to perform well, particularly his bowling; in his fifth first-class game, against Essex, Close took five for 58 in Essex's first innings, then top-scored with an undefeated 88 runs in the Yorkshire innings. His performances for Yorkshire earned him a place in the North v South match, which was also being used as a trial for selection for the upcoming Test matches against New Zealand. Close scored two runs, and did not take a wicket; The Times described his batting as a \"disappointing feature\" of the match, but noted that despite not taking any wickets, \"he bowled his off-breaks round the wicket well enough.\""]}, {"page": "Brian Statham", "response": ["Statham really made an impression when he encountered Yorkshire for the first time in the Roses Match which began at Old Trafford on Saturday, 5 August. A large crowd was present and Statham caused a stir when he lost his footing and fell over while running up to bowl the first ball. He responded by simply dusting himself down and starting again.Derlien, page 24. After conceding a single to Len Hutton, he bowled Frank Lowson for a duck and went on to take five for 52 as Yorkshire scored 226 with a century by their captain Norman Yardley. The match was an even contest and ended in a draw after Lancashire had been set 276 to win on the final day and made 160 for three. Wisden said that Statham's first innings bowling bordered on the sensational.Wisden 1951, page 397. Statham ended the 1950 season with 37 wickets, a best return of five for 18 (against Somerset) and a good average (eighth among bowlers who took at least ten wickets) of 16.56.Playfair 1951, page 132. He had earned a regular first-team place and was awarded his county cap.Playfair 1951, page 159.

After Burnet retired, Wilson was appointed as the first professional county captain of Yorkshire in 1960.

The rest of the batting was worn down by Goddard and Tayfield, both of whom finished with five wickets in the innings.

Fred Trueman made his debut in the 1949 game while his longtime England partner, Lancashire legend Brian Statham, made a big impact aged just 20 in his first Roses match in August 1950, when he shocked a packed Old Trafford crowd by falling flat on his face at the start of his opening spell.
