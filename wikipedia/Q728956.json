When the announcer, Norris McWhirter, declared \"The time was three...\", the cheers of the crowd drowned out Bannister's exact time, which was 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds.

Australian runner Don Macmillan, ninth in the 1500 m at the 1952 Olympics, set a strong pace with 59.6 for one lap and 1:59.7 for two. He gave up after two and a half laps, but Chris Brasher took up the pace. Brasher had jogged the race, allowing Bannister to lap him so he could be a fresh pace-setter. At  mile, Bannister was at 3:01.8, the record\u2014and first sub-four-minute mile\u2014in reach. But the effort fell short with a finish in 4:02.0, a time bettered by only Andersson and H\u00e4gg.

I don't want to have to take it\u00a0\u2013 I have too much respect for my body.\" Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved.
