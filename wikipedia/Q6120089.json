Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth David: A Life in Recipes", "response": ["* Jacqueline Defferary - Bulgie "]}, {"page": "Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick", "response": ["*Jacqueline Defferary (Sally)"]}, {"page": "Welcome to Thebes", "response": ["* Talthybia \u2013 Jacqueline Defferary"]}, {"page": "Tee Off, Mr. Bean", "response": ["* Jacqueline Defferary \u2013 Launderette Woman"]}, {"page": "Adaptations of Agatha Christie", "response": ["Starring Mark Umbers as Arthur Calgary and Jacqueline Defferary as Gwenda"]}]}}
