His initial survey was to measure the length of a degree of an arc of the meridian so as to establish the shape of the earth and support a larger scale trigonometrical survey across the width of the peninsula of India between Madras and Mangalore. After triangulating across the peninsula, he continued surveys northwards for more than twenty years.

Everest was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about , a task which took from 1806 to 1841 to complete. He was made Surveyor General of India in 1830, retiring in 1843 and returning to England.", "Little is known about Everest's earliest years in India, but he apparently had a talent for mathematics and astronomy. He was seconded to Java in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor Stamford Raffles appointed him to survey the island. He returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the Ganges and the Hooghly. He later surveyed a semaphore line from Calcutta to Benares, covering approximately . Everest's work came to the attention of Colonel William Lambton, the leader of the Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS), who appointed him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at Hyderabad in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a meridian arc northward from Cape Commorin.

Rennell was however irrational in proposing that the Niger ended in a lake without reaching the sea.

Around the same time, the trigonometric survey was proposed by William Lambton but there was little collaboration between the two during the Mysore survey. Mackenzie was told that his survey was not to be \"mere military or geographical information, but that your enquiries are to be extended to a statistical account of the whole country.\" However he was not provided enough resources for this grand plan. He wrote to Barry Close that he would not \"descend to the minutiae\" of measuring cultivated and uncultivated land but would instead focus on that which was of political and military importance. He pointed out that enquiries into revenues created uneasiness. One of his chief interpreters was a man named Kavelli Venkata Boria (IAST k\u0101vel\u012b ve\u1e43ke\u1e6d\u0101 boraiy\u0101\u1e25, there are variations in spelling) who Mackenzie first met in 1796, shortly after his return from Ceylon. He found Boria capable of dealing with all sects and considered him as \"the first step of my introduction into the portal of Indian knowledge.\" Boria knew Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Sankskrit. In 1797, Mackenzie visited Mudgeri and found the ruins of a Jain temple. He wrote an extensive note on the Jains based on interviews through his translator \"Cavelly Boria\". Boria died in 1803 and Mackenzie took in his brother Venkata Lechmiah (IAST lak\u1e63maiyy\u0101, also spelt Lakshmaiah or Lakshmayya). Another of Mackenzie's assistant was Dhurmiah (IAST dharmay\u0101\u1e25), a Jain pandit (scholar) from Maleyur, then in Mysore State. Dhurmiah, with his ability to read Hale Kannada (old Kannada) inscriptions contributed greatly to the study of the inscriptions in the region. Dhurmiah provided Mackenzie with Jain insights into the history of India but some ideas were considered too unreliable such as the idea that the Jains had fled from Mecca. Dhurmiah's son may also have been on Mackenzie's staff.

He used both droogs and temple gopurams as high points on which to place the great 450-kilogram theodolite used to measure his angles. This survey, commissioned by the English East India Company, gave it an accurate account of the lands it now controlled and was the most remarkable exercise of its kind ever undertaken anywhere.

Topping came to Madras in 1785 as a marine surveyor aboard the East India Ship Walpole. On the suggestion of Alexander Dalrymple, he conducted a triangulation survey of the Coromandel Coast from Madras to Masulipatnam in 1788, making us of a sextant. Topping suggested that this triangulation could be done across India, however this approach was only taken up much later by William Lambton. Topping was appointed from 1794 to survey water reservoirs and in order to conduct his \"tank surveys\" he sought to train (in his survey school) youths of mixed, that is, of European-Indian parentage from the Madras orphanage, and deploy them across southern India at a sixth of the allowances needed for military surveyors and without the need for interpreters. Topping persuaded astronomer William Petrie to transfer his private observatory to the government and set up the first modern astronomical observatory, the Madras Observatory, in Nungambakkam.

Petrie's original observatory was established in 1786 and was made of iron and timber. In 1789, Petrie gifted his instruments to the Madras Government before retiring to England. Sir Charles Oakley accepted Petrie's plea to establish an official observatory for the purpose of \"promoting  the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation  in  India\". The building was designed by Michael Topping on the bank of the river Cooum at Nungambakkam. The building consisted of a single room 40 feet long and 20 feet wide with a 15-foot ceiling. At the centre a granite pillar of 10 tons supported a 12-inch azimuth transit circle instrument made by Troughton. These were used to make observations on the meridian that began in 9 January 1793. Topping died in 1796 and was succeeded by John Goldingham who was formerly Petrie's assistant, Government Architect and Editor of the Government Gazette apart from serving as first superintendent of the Engineering School. Goldingham determined the longitude as 80\u00b0 18' 30\" based on eclipses of Jupiter's moons. This was the value used as a benchmark by William Lambton for the Great Trigonometrical Survey. When Goldingham went on leave between 1805 and 1810, the observatory was maintained by Lt. John Warren (born Jean-Baptiste Francois Joseph de Warren, 21 September 1769 \u2013 9 February 1830, Pondicherry) who recalculated the longitude as 80\u00b017'21\"E. He recorded observations on the comet of September 1807 and computed the declinations of several stars. Goldingham returned in 1812 and served until 1830 when he was replaced by Thomas Glanville Taylor who measured the positions of 11,000 stars which were published in five volumes which came to be known as the \"Madras Catalogue\".

He used a technique to make silk airtight and ballooned from Bristol to Waterford while forgetting to pay his rent back in Dublin and nearly losing all his equipment which were to be sold off by the owner. He received an honorary Doctor of Law degree in 1792 from the University of Edinburgh and he was invited to join the embassy of Lord Macartney to China in 1792-93 where he was to demonstrate science and especially astronomy, a diving bell and a balloon for the Chinese emperor.

In 1795 he gathered subscriptions to lecture to nearly 180 ladies and gentlemen in Calcutta and raised rupees 100 for it. Some of the surveying instruments carried by Dinwiddie to China such as the chain were then sold in Calcutta and used by William Lambton in his initial surveys in southern India. In August 1795 Dinwiddie was appointed to assist the Board of Trade on matters of science for a pay of 500 rupees a month for a year but this was not extended. He also constructed a voltaic pile with which he claimed to have \"treated\" patients with palsy and rheumatism with electric shocks.

He trained the Indian students Hurry Mohun Thakoor and Gopee Mohun Deb in astronomy in 1795. His students included the surveyor James Rennell. Dinwiddie advised the East India Company, prepared the chemists kit carried by Francis Buchanan for his survey of Mysore and manufactured nitrous acid for use in the hospital at Calcutta. Dinwiddie was also in correspondence with Joseph Hume who was his agent and supplier of chemicals in London. In 1796 he visited Madras where he met the Governor, Lord Hobart.
