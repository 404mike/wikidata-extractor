He was especially noted for his fielding and was an early stalwart of Marylebone Cricket Club.\nHe was a native of Chatham and educated at Westminster school. He played regularly for Chatham Cricket Club until 1773 and is not known to have played again until 1783. In all he made 134 recorded appearances in major matches.  Only the Earl of Winchilsea (128) and William Bullen (119) were anywhere near his total when he retired.\nIn August 1789, it was reported in the press that Louch had been killed on the field by \"a ball from the point of the bat, struck with such force that it lodged in his body\". He survived the injury and was back in action the following season. \nWhen Louch died, the Kentish Gazette of 7 May 1811 carried this notice: \"Died April 29 at Ramsgate after a short illness, George Louch Esq, deeply regretted by all who knew him\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "White Conduit Club", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" | In this game, White Conduit combined with Moulsey Hurst Club in order to take on Hornchurch.

A. Thomson wrote that Winchilsea \"would go anywhere for a game of cricket\".Thomson: Odd Men In, p. 15. He was certainly prolific and is one of the most recorded players of the 18th century, though he was far from being among the best and was already 33 when he was first recorded in a senior match. He is known to have played in more than 130 top-class matches from 1785 to 1804, and records of many other matches have certainly been lost. His level of activity is matched by few of his contemporaries; only Billy Beldham and Tom Walker made a substantially greater number of appearances. Lord Frederick Beauclerk and George Louch were the only amateurs of the time as prolific as Winchilsea, but they were much better players because Winchilsea on the field was something of a liability. His known career batting average was a lowly single figure, despite using a bat that weighed 4\u00a0lb 2 oz."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*George Louch (1746\u20131811) \u2013 cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|George Louch"]}, {"page": "List of historically significant English cricket teams", "response": ["The first reference to a team from Chatham, Kent, is a match against West of Kent in 1705, one of the earliest known important matches.
