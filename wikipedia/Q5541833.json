He was especially noted for his fielding and was an early stalwart of Marylebone Cricket Club.\nHe was a native of Chatham and educated at Westminster school. He played regularly for Chatham Cricket Club until 1773 and is not known to have played again until 1783. In all he made 134 recorded appearances in major matches.  Only the Earl of Winchilsea (128) and William Bullen (119) were anywhere near his total when he retired.\nIn August 1789, it was reported in the press that Louch had been killed on the field by \"a ball from the point of the bat, struck with such force that it lodged in his body\". He survived the injury and was back in action the following season. \nWhen Louch died, the Kentish Gazette of 7 May 1811 carried this notice: \"Died April 29 at Ramsgate after a short illness, George Louch Esq, deeply regretted by all who knew him\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
