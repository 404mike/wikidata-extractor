Tree staged many contemporary verse dramas by Stephen Phillips and others, including Herod (1900),  Ulysses (1902), Nero (1906) and Faust (1908).

Somerset Maugham, an adaptation of the classic Moli\u00e8re play, Le bourgeois gentilhomme (1913).  The classical repertory included such works as The School for Scandal (1909).  Tree also programmed popular melodramas, farces, romantic comedies and premieres, such as Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, in 1914. Tree played Henry Higgins opposite the Eliza of Mrs Patrick Campbell. The actor John Gielgud wrote, \"Rehearsing Pygmalion with Tree she must have been impossible. They were both such eccentrics.
