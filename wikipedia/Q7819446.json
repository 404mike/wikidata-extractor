Everton dominated the first half but were unable to score from any of the chances they created, and it was Albion who broke the deadlock ten minutes into the second half. Albion captain Tommy Glidden played the ball into the Everton penalty area from near the halfway line, and aided by a gust of wind it sailed past Everton goalkeeper Billy Coggins and into the net. The match was played in front of 69,241 spectators, setting a new attendance record for Old Trafford.McOwan pp. 48\u201349.", "In the sixth minute, Bob Gregg headed Jimmy Cringan's free kick past the stranded West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, but the linesman flagged Gregg offside and the goal was disallowed; newspaper reports suggest the decision was incorrect.The Daily Mail match report, reproduced in Thraves, pp.\u00a024\u201325. Albion took the lead after 24 minutes when Joe Carter received the ball from Tommy Glidden and took it almost to the by-line before crossing it. As W. G. Richardson attempted a shot he fell, but Birmingham's Ned Barkas inadvertently touched the ball back to him and away from his goalkeeper, and Richardson was able to recover sufficiently to steer it home. Joe Bradford and Johnny Crosbie both missed good chances for Birmingham before half-time.Matthews (1995), p.\u00a019."]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["West Brom went into the match as favourites even though they were below Wednesday in the table, pundits believing that they had the better forward players with Wally Boyes, W.G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin.", "| ||7 || Tommy Glidden (c)"]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jimmy CooksonTommy Glidden"]}, {"page": "Coxlodge", "response": ["Notable people who were born in Coxlodge include Tommy Glidden, an English footballer."]}, {"page": "Billy Coggins", "response": ["Coggins also featured in Everton's run to the 1931 FA Cup Semi-final which was played at Old Trafford against West Bromwich Albion on 14 March 1931.
