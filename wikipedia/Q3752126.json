New manager Kenny Dalglish accepted a bid of around \u00a32.5 million for Elliott from Division One champions Bolton Wanderers in July 1997, becoming their record signing at the time. Bolton had, at the time, moved to the new 25,000 all-seater Reebok Stadium arena and this looked to be a new start for Elliott as he faced the prospect of more regular first team football alongside his former Newcastle teammates Alan Thompson, Peter Beardsley, Scott Sellars and Franz Carr, all of whom were also on Bolton's books at that time."]}, {"page": "A.C.

Despite his presence, the team finished bottom of the First Division and missed out on the first season of the Premier League. The 1992\u201393 season was an eventful one for Dicks, mainly for the wrong reasons. He was sent off three times and picked up a string of bookings which saw him miss significant periods of the season and he was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Bonds. His first dismissal came after he threw his elbow into the face of Newcastle United player Franz Carr. There had been no friction between the two players with Dicks saying of the incident \"Not to this day do I know why I did it. I had it in my mind that I was going to elbow him, and that was it\u00a0\u2014 bang!\". Only four games passed before he was dismissed again. In a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Dicks clashed with Paul Birch and Steve Bull before being sent-off, with Billy Bonds having to stop him attacking Birch who was still on the ground. Barely three months passed before his third dismissal of the season. In January 1993 after two bad fouls on Derby County midfielder Ted McMinn he was sent-off, having to be escorted from the pitch by teammate Clive Allen. Despite his disciplinary problems he earned a Division One runners-up medal as West Ham reached the Premier League. Despite his dismissals he played 34 league games of a possible 46 in the promotion season, scoring eleven goals, placing third in the list of highest goal scorers for that season behind only Clive Allen and Trevor Morley."]}, {"page": "Steel City derby", "response": ["* Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Serie A players", "response": ["*Franz Carr \u2013 Reggiana \u2013 1996\u201397"]}, {"page": "1990 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|LM ||11 || Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "List of Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC players", "response": ["*  Franz Carr *"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Franz Carr ||  Reggiana || 24 October 1997 || 28 January 1998", "| Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Franz Carr", "|  Franz Carr", "|  Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["|Franz Carr", "|Franz Carr"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["Long-serving defender Paul McGrath left in the autumn to sign for Derby County after more than seven years at Villa Park.
