He made one appearance in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2011\u201312 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["On the 2nd, Argyle hosted local Devon rivals Torquay United in front of 12,836 at Home Park, which at the time was the highest League Two attendance of the season. The Gulls scored two second half goals through Billy Bodin and Lee Mansell, meaning that Luke Young's first Argyle goal was nothing but a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat. With the January transfer window now open, Argyle confirmed the permanent signings of Nick Chadwick and Darren Purse, who had previously only been on loan from Stockport County and Millwall respectively, as well as signing former youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth from Bideford. Crewe Alexandra won all three points when Argyle travelled to Gresty Road, a brace from Luke Murphy and a penalty scored by Ashley Westwood meant that Simon Walton's penalty and Matt Lecointe's second goal of the season were once again, nothing but consolations. Conor Hourihane was sent off late on in the game for two bookable offences, which was Argyle's tenth and final red card of the season, whilst first team coach Kevin Nancekivell was sent to the stands.", "Will Atkinson's loan from Hull City expired, so Argyle extended Ashley Hemmings' loan deal from Wolves and the contract of Maxime Blanchard until the end of the season, along with signing former Argyle captain Paul Wotton on a free transfer from Yeovil Town, and young winger Joe Lennox from Bristol City. Argyle played two home games in a row, the first seeing the team's first win of 2012, with a 2\u20131 win over Burton Albion, where two goals from Simon Walton either side of a goal from Calvin Zola sealed the points. The second game saw Argyle rescue a late point thanks to Maxime Blanchard's first goal in English football, the goal lifted Argyle out of the bottom two with the French defender scoring an overhead kick to cancel out Pablo Mills' first half stoppage time goal for high flying Crawley Town. The last game of the month saw the Greens travel to Port Vale's Vale Park, where an 86th minute Tom Pope goal saw the hosts win 1\u20130. Youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth left to join Truro City on loan, whilst striker Rory Patterson returned from his loan at Linfield and was immediately released. On the transfer deadline day, strikers Juvhel Tsoumou and Alex MacDonald joined on loan deals from Preston North End and Burnley respectively.", "Argyle's form had significantly improved compared to fellow relegation battlers Hereford United, who Argyle travelled to on the 6th of April. An own goal from Dutch defender Stefan Stam gave Argyle the lead, but the Greens failed to extend their lead after a missed penalty from Simon Walton and the inevitable happened when Hereford's Tom Barkhuizen equalised in the second half. An injury to goalkeeper Jake Cole saw Romain Larrieu start and saw Ollie Chenoweth recalled from his loan at Truro City to sit on the bench in a 1\u20130 win at home to Aldershot Town; Alex MacDonald the goalscorer. A visit to historical rivals Swindon Town was next, and despite losing 1\u20130 through an 84th minute Alan Connell goal, results elsewhere meant that Argyle were nearly safe from relegation, with seven points separating them from the bottom two and with three games left to play.", "It was in Argyle's very next game in which they secured their Football League survival, a 1\u20131 draw with Oxford United at Home Park. Robbie Williams' free kick had given Argyle the lead, before Asa Hall equalised for the visitors. Macclesfield's and Hereford's results elsewhere meant that Argyle were safe. With league survival now secured, Argyle travelled to Morecambe and gave a debut to goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth. Luke Young's fourth-minute goal was cancelled out by Jordan Burrow and Lewis Alessandra, before captain-for-the-day Darren Purse headed home a late equaliser for Argyle.", "|align=\"left\"|Ollie Chenoweth", "|Ollie Chenoweth"]}]}}
