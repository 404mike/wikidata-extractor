He played in goal for Nottingham Forest, Exeter City and Doncaster Rovers, although he made just three Football League appearances in total with his playing days largely coinciding with the Second World War.\nLambton is better remembered for his spells in coaching and management. He worked as a coach in Denmark with KB Copenhagen and then with Scunthorpe United, Grimsby Town and Leeds United. In December 1958 he became Leeds manager. Despite signing Leeds legends Don Revie and Billy Bremner, he was asked to leave after just four months. This however was to be significantly longer than his next managerial post, as he was in charge of Scunthorpe for just three days in April 1959.\nLambton was appointed Chester manager in January 1962, two months after the sacking of Stan Pearson. Chester were enduring a miserable season that saw them finish bottom of the Football League. Greater things were expected the following season, but a poor run of just four wins in their last 18 games saw them finish fourth from bottom and forced to again apply for re-election to the league. Although Chester comfortably achieved enough votes to remain in the league, Lambton had his contract cancelled by mutual consent in July 1963.\nA former Sergeant Major in the Army, Lambton was known as 'Iron Man Bill'. He died in Sherwood, Nottingham aged 61.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Leeds struggled after Raich Carter left the club in 1958, and Willis Edwards and then Bill Lambton took charge in the 1958\u201359 season as Leeds finished nine points above the relegation zone.

Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958\u201359, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959\u201360 campaign with the division's worst defensive record.

His father forbade him from joining Celtic as he did not want him involved in the religion-based rivalry with Rangers, and Bremner rejected both Arsenal and Chelsea as he did not enjoy his stay in London during trial spells with the two clubs, and was instead convinced to join Bill Lambton's Leeds United in 1959. He joined along with his friend Tommy Henderson, who would return to Scotland due to homesickness without making a first team debut. Manager Jack Taylor gave him his debut at outside-right in a 3\u20131 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, at the age of 17 years and 47 days; Yorkshire Evening Post reporter Phil Brown noted that Bremner showed \"enthusiasm, guts, intelligence, most accurate use of the ball and unselfishness\" despite poor weather conditions. A The Sunday Times headline later dubbed him as \"10st of barbed wire\" due to his tenacity and tough tackling. Regular outside-right Chris Crowe was sold to Blackburn Rovers in March 1960, allowing Bremner to take his place on a permanent basis. However, Leeds went on to be relegated from the First Division at the end of the 1959\u201360 season."]}]}}
