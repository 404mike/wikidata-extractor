In a general sense in his work, it refers to the depletion of global resources beyond the Earth's ability to regenerate them.</ref>Andrew Simms. The concept in this sense is based on the bio-physical carrying capacity of an ecosystem; through measuring ecological footprints human society can determine the rate at which it is depleting natural resources. Ultimately, the imperative of sustainability requires human society to live within the means of the ecological system to support life over the long term.
