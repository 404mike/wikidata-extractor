Three particularly complete examples can be found in Walthamstow, specifically: St Barnabas Walthamstow (1903; arch. W.D. Caroe), St Michael and All Angels Walthamstow (1885; arch. J. M. Bignell). and St Saviour Walthamstow (1874; arch. T. F. Dolman). (The church of St Oswald Walthamstow, also funded by Foster, no longer stands.)\nFoster was born in Stainforth, Yorkshire but moved to London to work in the family's financial business of Foster Brothers. He eventually became head of the firm, known then as Knowles and Foster. He was also a director of the London and River Plate Bank and of the Scottish Metropolitan Gas Company.He seems to have taken an active interest in social matters being a director of the London Labourers Dwelling Association (Society?) and a treasurer for the London Hospital. Among other institutions he actively supported were: St Bartholomew's Hospital, the National Society, the National Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the East London Church Fund and the Bishop of St Alban's Fund.He died at Holmewood, his home in Chislehurst, Kent and was buried in the parish churchyard there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Foster", "response": ["Richard Foster may refer to:", "* Richard Foster (abolitionist) (1826\u20131901), founder of the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri", "* Richard Foster (Alaska politician) (1946\u20132009), Democratic member of the Alaska House of Representatives", "* Richard Foster (architect) (1919\u20132002), American modernist architect", "* Richard Foster (Australian footballer), Australian rules footballer", "* Richard Foster (Royal Marines officer) (1879\u20131965)", "* Richard Foster (Scottish footballer) (born 1985), Scottish football player", "* Richard Foster (painter) (born 1945), British portrait painter", "* Richard Foster (theologian) (fl. 2000s), Quaker religious leader and author", "* Richard Foster (philanthropist) (1822\u20131910), City of London merchant", "* Richard Foster, a pen name of Kendell Foster Crossen (1910\u20131981), American writer", "*Richard Foster (The Walking Dead)"]}, {"page": "St Barnabas Church, Walthamstow", "response": ["The church originated in 1900 when an iron mission church was erected on a plot of land in the parish of St Saviour in Markhouse Road, and a separate ecclesiastical parish was created for the church in 1901. The land for the church was donated by Richard Foster, a wealthy City of London merchant who had supported the building of several other new churches in the area; he also funded the construction of a permanent church building, church hall and vicarage, intended to serve the residents of the new Warner Estate."]}]}}
