When he published his first book it was privately, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher. His friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration, and his name appears as publisher on the early impressions. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd), agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although the printing was done by the Westmorland Gazette in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, the Westmorland Gazette became his publisher, and its name appears on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. Wainwright's books were in turn taken over by Michael Joseph in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003, the rights were bought by Frances Lincoln.", "Between 2005 and 2009, all the Pictorial Guides were updated for the first time, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions were made by Chris Jesty, and the publishers used an imitation font of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes were the inclusion of photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs on the front covers, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and footpaths shown in red on the maps. These revised versions are titled 'Second Editions'. Revised editions of Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, A Coast to Coast Walk, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland, Pennine Way Companion, Walks in Limestone Country and Walks on the Howgill Fells were published by Frances Lincoln between 2010 and 2014, with the amendments again being made by Chris Jesty.", "* Twelve Favourite Mountains compiled by Frances Lincoln Ltd (2007)", "* Wainwright: The Podcasts compiled by Frances Lincoln Ltd (2008)"]}, {"page": "Alan Lee (illustrator)", "response": ["He has illustrated retellings of classics for young people.

He was born in Blackfriars, London on 5 May 1824. Thomas Williams, his father, co-owned and operated a family coach-driving business with service from London to Reading, a company which was eventually dissolved. Other than that, and that he preferred to be called \"T. R.\" to \"Thomas,\" research on his early life has turned up little. It seems reasonable, however, that he may have spent good portions of his childhood in the village of Hinton Waldrist in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), which later became a favourite subject of many of his surviving photographs, and a place for which he expressed in his work and writing a great deal of fondness.May, Brian and Vidal, Elena.

May and Vidal write: \u201cThe still life studies, with their fine detail and careful composition, showed a clear influence from the 17th century Dutch painting tradition, and a profound knowledge of the iconography surrounding this genre. Photographs such as \u2018The Old Larder,\u2019 \u2018Mortality\u2019 and \u2018Hawk and Duckling\u2019 are superb examples of the unique power of stereography, with their superb three-dimensional compositions, and wealth of detail, which, combined with an outstanding artistic sensibility, resulted in images of astonishing finesse. Another remarkable group of images in this series, entitled \u201cThe Launching of the Marlborough\u201d, taken on 31 July 1855, was highly praised in the Victorian press, since they embodied the achievement of \u2018instantaneous\u2019 photography, executed as they were from a moving boat, and managing to \u2018freeze\u2019 the waves on the surface of the sea.\u201d May, Brian and Vidal, Elena. \u2018\u2018A Village Lost and Found.\u2019\u2019 Frances Lincoln Limited, 2009, p. 178", "Lies snug till market day.May, Brian and Vidal, Elena. \u2018\u2018A Village Lost and Found.\u2019\u2019 Frances Lincoln Limited, 2009, p. 90", "However, despite his popularity and fame\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014Williams ceased production of these types of images after this series, stating they had become \u201cvulgarized by imitation.\u201d May, Brian and Vidal, Elena. \u2018\u2018A Village Lost and Found.\u2019\u2019 Frances Lincoln Limited, 2009, p. 180", "\u201cRepresented in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, [others] included the confirmation of Princess Alice (April 21, 1859), studies of Princesses Louise and Helena, and of Princess Victoria with her first son, Prince William.\"May, Brian and Vidal, Elena.
