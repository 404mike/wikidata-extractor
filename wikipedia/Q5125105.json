The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clair", "response": ["Clair or Claire may refer to:", "*Claire (given name), a list of people with the name Claire", "*Clair (surname)", "* Clair, New Brunswick, a former village, now part of Haut-Madawaska", "* Clair Parish, New Brunswick", "* Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada, municipality located on the Island of Montreal", "* Clair, Saskatchewan", "* Lake Claire (Atlanta), Georgia, neighborhood", "* Le Claire, Iowa, city in Scott County", "* Eau Claire, Michigan, village in Berrien County", "* Eau Claire, Pennsylvania, borough in Butler County", "* Claire City, South Dakota, town in Roberts County", "* Eau Claire, Wisconsin, city", "* Eau Claire County, Wisconsin", "* Saint Clair, Missouri, city", "* St. Clair County, Michigan", "* St. Clair, Michigan, city", "* St. Clair, Minnesota, city", "* St. Clair, Pennsylvania, city", "* St. Clair Shores, Michigan, city", "* Clair oilfield in the Atlantic Ocean, 75\u00a0km west of Shetland", "* Clair (Hampshire cricketer), English professional cricketer", "* \"Clair\" (song), a 1972 hit for Gilbert O'Sullivan", "* Clair Global, an international sound reinforcement and event technology company", "* \"Claire\", an episode of American radio and television anthology series Screen Directors Playhouse ", "* Claire (band), electronic-pop band using English lyrics from Munich, Germany", "* Claire Redfield, a player character appearing in the Resident Evil series of survival horror video games", "* Claire Bennet, a fictional character in the NBC science fiction drama series Heroes", "* Clair Huxtable, a fictional character in the NBC sitcom The Cosby Show, portrayed by Phylicia Rashad", "* Claire (2001 film), a fantasy film", "* Claire (1924 film), a German silent film", "* Claire (album), a 2002 album by Claire Sweeney", "* Claire (programming language), an object-oriented programming language", "* Claire's, a female accessory store", "* Claire (2007 film), a film written by Drew Seeley", "* Clair, the cousin of Lance and eighth gym leader of Johto from Pok\u00e9mon", "* Clair, the younger sister of the Leader of the Zofian Liberation and the playable character in Alm's route from Fire Emblem Gaiden", "* Claire Wyden, a character in the 2018 film Rampage", "* Clair Lake (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Clair (surname)", "response": ["Clair is a French surname.
