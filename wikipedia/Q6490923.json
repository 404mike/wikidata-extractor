Other sources stated that Davies wrote \"You Really Got Me\" while trying to work out the chords of \"Louie Louie\" at the suggestion of the group's manager, Larry Page. According to biographer Thomas M. Kitts, Davies confirmed that Page suggested that \"he write a song like 'Louie Louie'\", but denied any direct influence."]}, {"page": "The Troggs", "response": ["Reg Presley (lead vocals) and Ronnie Bond (drums) were childhood friends and in the early 1960s formed an R&B band in their home town of Andover.  In 1964 they were joined by Pete Staples (bass) and Chris Britton (guitar) and became the Troggs. They were signed by Larry Page, manager of the Kinks, in 1965. They recorded on Page's Page One Records, and Page also leased them to CBS for the debut single \"Lost Girl\". Their most famous hit was the single \"Wild Thing\" (written by Chip Taylor) (the song on the B-side of the single depended on the country where it was sold) which, with the help of television exposure on Thank Your Lucky Stars, reached number 2 in the UK (b/w Reg Presley's song \"From Home\") and number 1 in the United States in July 1966. Its combination of a simple heavy guitar riff and flirtatious lyrics helped it to quickly become a garage rock standard.  It was recorded in one complete take (take two) at Olympic Studios in London, with Keith Grant engineering.  Because of a dispute over US distribution rights, \"Wild Thing\" was released (along with the first album of the same name) on two labels: Fontana and Atco. The band's success in the US was also limited by not touring there until 1968.", "They also had a number of other hits, including \"With a Girl Like You\" (a UK number 1 in July 1966, US number 29), \"I Can't Control Myself\" (a UK number 2 in September 1966; their first UK single release on the Page One label, POF 001; this was also their second and final dual-label release in the US, with Fontana retaining the rights to all subsequent releases), \"Anyway That You Want Me\" (UK number 10 in December 1966), all at Olympic Studios, \"Give It To Me\" (UK No.12 1967), \"Night of the Long Grass\" (UK number 17 in May 1967), \"Love Is All Around\" (UK number 5 in November 1967 and US number 7 in May 1968) plus \"Hi Hi Hazel\" (UK No.42, 1967). The band's popularity completely waned the following year. Former Plastic Penny bassist Tony Murray replaced Pete Staples in 1969. Richard Moore filled in for Britton on their 1972\u20131973 tour. In 1974, after a spell on Pye Records, in an attempt to re-create their 1960s successes, the Troggs re-united with Larry Page, now running Penny Farthing Records. The resulting cover version of the Beach Boys hit \"Good Vibrations\" failed to chart. A reggae version of \"Wild Thing\" also failed. Richard Moore and Colin Fletcher substituted for Britton, who temporarily quit music to manage a night club in Spain, for the recording of The Troggs Tapes album released in 1976. The band found a sympathetic ear at French label New Rose in the 1980s, releasing the Black Bottom LP (1982) and AU (1990)."]}, {"page": "Hip Young Guitar Slinger", "response": ["Likewise, officially Page has been credited with playing acoustic twelve string guitar on two tracks on The Kinks' debut album, specifically on \"I'm a Lover Not a Fighter\" and \"I've Been Driving On Bald Mountain\",Booklet of Kinks (album) Deluxe Edition Sanctuary Records 2011 and possibly on the B-side \"I Gotta Move\",Booklet of the Kinks' Picture Book boxset Sanctuary Records 2008 but not on \"Bald Headed Woman\" or \"Revenge\".

Looking to branch out, the Kinks sought out a manager, and after a few unsuccessful meetings, they met Larry Page, who promised the group a certain degree of fame. Page introduced the Ravens to American record producer Shel Talmy along with the Beatles' promoter, Arthur Howes, who was their tour manager. Talmy managed to secure the group a recording contract with Pye Records, who he previously had been collaborating with.

He pursued interests in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music, including jazz and blues. When Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated played at the college in December, he asked advice from Alexis Korner, who recommended Giorgio Gomelsky, the former Yardbirds manager, who put Davies in touch with the Soho-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B. A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported Cyril Stapleton at the Lyceum Ballroom on New Year's Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included Charlie Watts on drums. In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had Peter Bardens as pianist. At the end of the spring term he left Hornsey College with a view to study film at the Central School of Art and Design, around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods. Davies has referred to a show the fledgling Kinks played (again as the Ray Davies Quartet) at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 as their first important gig. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up, though the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band, and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens. The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer Larry Page became their third manager. American record producer Shel Talmy began working with the band, and the Beatles' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows.Savage, Jon (1984). pp. 15\u201319 The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with Pye Records. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye. The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in Melody Maker. Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling Rolling Stones.", "Around this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they \"needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'\u2014something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual\u2014fame through outrage.\"Savage, Jon (1984). p. 17 Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: \"I had a friend...

When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky!
