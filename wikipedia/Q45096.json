English naturalist William Yarrell also reported the country practice of killing a kingfisher and hanging it from a thread in the belief that it would swing to predict the direction in which the wind would blow.

This refers to the birds' two most conspicuous behaviours \u2013 storing food animals by impaling them on thorns, and using exposed tree-tops or poles to watch the surrounding area for possible prey. Use of the former by Conrad Gessner established the quasi-scientific term lanius for the shrikes. Linnaeus chose his specific name because the species \"observes approaching hawks and announces [the presence] of songbirds\"Accipitres adventantes observat & aviculis indicat: Linnaeus (1758) as he put it. This habit was also put to use in falconry, as fancifully recorded by William Yarrell later.Gessner (1555): p. 557, Linnaeus (1758), Glare (1968\u20131982): pp. 637, 1000, Swainson (2008): p. 47 The common English name \"shrike\" is from Old English scr\u00edc, \"shriek\", referring to the shrill call."]}, {"page": "White wagtail", "response": ["There are a number of other subspecies, some of which may have arisen because of partial geographical isolation, such as the resident British and Irish form, the pied wagtail M. a. yarrellii, which now also breeds in adjacent areas of the neighbouring European mainland. The pied wagtail, named for naturalist William Yarrell, exchanges the grey colour of the nominate form with black (or very dark grey in females), but is otherwise identical in its behaviour. Other subspecies, the validity of some of which is questionable, differ in the colour of the wings, back, and head, or other features. Some races show sexual dimorphism during the breeding season. As many as six subspecies may be present in the wintering ground in India or Southeast Asia and here they can be difficult to distinguish. Phylogenetic studies using mtDNA suggest that some morphological features have evolved more than once, including the back and chin colour. Breeding M. a. yarrellii look much like the nominate race except for the black back, and M. a. alboides of the Himalayas differs from the Central Asian M. a. personata only by its black back. M. a. personata has been recorded breeding in the Siddar Valley of Kashmir of the Western Himalayas. It has also been noted that both back and chin change colour during the pre-basic moult; all black-throated subspecies develop white chins and throats in winter and some black-backed birds are grey-backed in winter.", "The British subspecies Motacilla alba yarellii was named after William Yarrell (1784-1856), the writer of the History of British Birds (first ed. 1843)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bewick", "response": ["Bewick's fame, already nationwide across Britain for his Birds, grew during the nineteenth century.
