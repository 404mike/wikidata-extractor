He also played Southern League football for Norwich City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Ingham", "response": ["He went on to play for Norwich City and was twice selected to play for the Southern League representative side. Together with Norwich team-mate Percy Sutcliffe, Ingham signed professional forms with North-Eastern League club Darlington in 1914. He scored 18 goals in league competition in the 1914\u201315 season and scored once from five appearances in the FA Cup. Competitive football was suspended in 1915 due to the First World War and there is no record of Ingham resuming his career after the conflict."]}, {"page": "Hughie Dickson", "response": ["Dickson was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in 1895. He played for Gainsborough Trinity and for Worksop Town before joining Darlington when the club re-formed after the First World War. By January 1920, Dickson was part of a Darlington half-back line\u00a0\u2013 the others being George Malcolm and Percy Sutcliffe\u00a0\u2013 who, according to the Daily Express ahead of their FA Cup tie with Second Division Birmingham, had acquired \"a reputation for upsetting opponents' designs\". In the event, they could not upset Birmingham's designs: Tommy Winship missed a penalty, and Darlington lost 4\u20130. Dickson and right-back Arthur Golightly were their most \"conspicuous\" players, though both \"perceptibly tired under pressure\" towards the end of the game. In February, he was one of two Darlington players selected for the North Eastern League representative team to face the Central League. He helped Darlington win the North Eastern League title in 1920\u201321, after which the club was elected to the Football League's newly formed Third Division Northern Section."]}, {"page": "List of Darlington F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club. Tommy Barbour, Percy Sutcliffe, Alf Dolphin and Arthur Wolstenholme played in Darlington's first match in the Football League, a 2\u20130 win at home to Halifax Town on 27 August 1921. Tommy Moran scored twice and created two other goals, one for Ron Harbertson, as Darlington eliminated Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1957\u201358 FA Cup to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Gary Coatsworth scored the goal that confirmed Darlington as winners of the 1989\u201390 Football Conference title. John McReady, Gary Smith and Michael Smith played in Darlington's last match in the Football League, against Dagenham & Redbridge on 8 May 2010. After Tommy Wright struck the bar in the 120th minute of the 2011 FA Trophy Final, substitute Chris Senior was first to the rebound to head Darlington's winning goal. Jamie Chandler was man of the match, and the team included seven other men listed here."]}, {"page": "Eddie Hanlon", "response": ["Barnsley chose not to retain Hanlon's services, and he returned to Darlington, where he contributed to their winning the North-Eastern League title for the first time in 1912\u201313. In the 1914\u201315 FA Cup, Hanlon scored the only goal with two minutes remaining of the match against London Caledonians to take Darlington through to the first round proper, in which they faced Bradford City. The Yorkshire Post reported that in general Darlington paid the First Division club too much respect, but picked out Hanlon and Percy Sutcliffe as \"effective spoilers of their opponents' tactics\"."]}]}}
