He fancies the equally blonde Helga Geerhart, whom he plans to marry after the war. He has a considerably exaggerated limp, and frequently uses the word 'Gestapo' as an adjective: \"My powerful Gestapo binoculars\", \"My Gestapo staff car\" etc. In one episode he answers the phone by announcing himself as \"Flick, the Gestapo\"; after a short period, he is forced to explain to the caller that he said \"Flick, the Gestapo\" and not \"Fick (German for the \"f-word\") the Gestapo\". Herr Flick often hits von Smallhausen on the head with his cane, saying \"Wrong!\" When Herr Flick wants Helga to kiss him, he will say in a stern manner \"You may kiss me now!\" In the episode \"Pigeon Post\", it is revealed that he has the same taste in undergarments as Helga.
