In December 1946, Doherty moved to David Steele's Huddersfield Town for a fee of over \u00a39,000 after requesting a transfer. Doherty was unhappy with the directors who opposed his plan to secure his future by taking over the Arboretum Hotel and an earlier dispute over FA Cup Final tickets. The \"Terriers\" boasted a powerful front five of Albert Bateman, Jimmy Glazzard, Alf Whittingham, Doherty and Vic Metcalfe. However a weak defence saw them struggle in the lower reaches of the First Division throughout the 1946\u201347 season, 1947\u201348 and 1948\u201349 seasons. At Leeds Road he scored 33 goals in 83 league appearances, finishing as the \"Terriers\" top-scorer in his final two seasons under George Stephenson."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Alf Whittingham||||1936\u20131947||87||24||"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Alf Whittingham||||FW||11||1||0||0||11||1"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Alf Whittingham||||FW||41||9||1||0||42||9"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Alf Whittingham||||FW||15||7||0||0||15||7"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Alf Whittingham||||1947\u20131949||67||17||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||68||17"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["The final score was 11\u20130 to Southampton, which is the club's record result in a League match (although this was to be equalled a year later against Watford). Brown's tally of seven goals in one match is the highest scored by a Southampton player in a competitive match, although Alf Whittingham scored eight in a wartime match in 1945 against Luton Town. Speaking about this match in 1924, trainer Bill Dawson claimed that his players had \"a little secret\" that enabled them to keep their feet on the heavy ground."]}]}}
