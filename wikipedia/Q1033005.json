He is best known for originating the concept of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) with a few other colleagues and has been referred to as one of the 'founding fathers'  of the project. CMS is a world-wide collaboration which started in 1991 and now has over 3500 participants from 45 countries.\nVirdee was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Institute of Physics (IOP) in 2012. In recognition of his work on CMS he has been awarded the IOP High Energy Particle Physics group prize (2007) and the IOP Chadwick Medal and Prize (2009). In 2012, he was awarded the 2013 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics\nfor 'leadership in the scientific endeavour that led to the discovery of the new Higgs-like particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) along with 6 other physicists. He was awarded the 2013 European Physical Society High Energy and Particle Physics Prize and the 2017 American Physical Society Panofsky Prize for his pioneering work and outstanding leadership in the making of the CMS experiment. In 2020 he was awarded the Blaise Pascal Medal of the European Academy of Sciences in Physics. He was also on the Physical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2020.In 2014, Virdee was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to science.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Imperial College London", "response": ["Academic affiliations include: Sir Tom Kibble, co-discoverer of Higgs Boson;\u2018KIBBLE, Sir Thomas (Walter Bannerman)\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2016 ; online edn, Nov 2016 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Tejinder Virdee, experimental particle physicist; Sir John Pendry, theoretical solid state physicist; Sir Christopher Kelk Ingold, physical organic chemistry pioneer;\u2018INGOLD, Sir Christopher (Keik)\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir William Henry Perkin, discoverer of the first synthetic organic chemical dye mauveine;\u2018PERKIN, Sir William Henry\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2015 ; online edn, Feb 2015 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Edward Frankland, originator of the theory of chemical valency;\u2018FRANKLAND, Sir Edward\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir William Crookes, discoverer of thallium;\u2018CROOKES, Prof. Sir William\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Alan Fersht, chemist; David Phillips, chemist; Harold Hopkins, contributed to the theory and design of optical instruments;\u2018HOPKINS, Prof. Harold Horace\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Alfred North Whitehead, mathematician and philosopher;\u2018WHITEHEAD, Alfred North\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Steven Cowley, physicist and president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; and Sir John Ambrose Fleming, inventor of the vacuum tube.\u2018FLEMING, Sir (John) Ambrose\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017"]}, {"page": "Panofsky Prize", "response": ["*2017:  Tejinder Virdee, Michel Della Negra, Peter Jenni"]}]}}
