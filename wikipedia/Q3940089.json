A constant barrage of sensationalistic rhetoric serves to rivet media attention while achieving multiple political objectives, not the least of which is that it serves to obscure actions such as profound neoliberal deregulation. One study gives the example that significant environmental deregulation occurred during the first year of the Trump administration due to its concurrent use of spectacular racist rhetoric but escaped much media attention. According to the authors, this served political objectives of dehumanizing its targets, eroding democratic norms, and consolidating power by emotionally connecting with and inflaming resentments among the base of followers but most importantly served to distract media attention from deregulatory policymaking by igniting intense media coverage of the distractions, precisely due to their radically transgressive nature."]}, {"page": "Homme House", "response": ["The estate passed down in the Money-Kyrle family for several generations until inherited by Roger Money-Kyrle, who sold the estate, much reduced in size, to his uncle, the Reverend Cecil Money-Kyrle, vicar of Much Marcle.
