His father was an agricultural labourer, and the family moved frequently around the Northumberland villages.  When just 10 years old, Story ran away to accompany a lame fiddler on an excursion through the Scottish Borders for a month, and about a year later the family moved to Howtel, where Story attended the local school.  He later claimed that this was where \"I learned nearly all that I ever learned from a Master\u2014namely to read badly, to write worse, and to cipher a little farther, perhaps than to the Rule of Three.\"  There he was introduced to Divine Songs for Children, and discovered a love of poetry while reading on the hills, where he was employed as a shepherd.  By 1820 he had moved to Gargrave in North Yorkshire where he opened a school, and in 1825 published a volume of poetry, Craven Blossoms.  Algernon Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, became a patron in 1857 and financed an edition of his works.  In 1859 Story was invited to Ayr for the centenary celebrations of Robert Burns, where he recited his poem on Burns.  The Bradfordian considered that \"he stands high among the minor poets of Great Britain, and many of his sweet lyrics will most assuredly descend to and be highly admired by posterity, and by none more than Yorkshiremen.\""]}, {"page": "Robert Story", "response": ["Robert Story may refer to:", "*Robert Story (poet) (1795\u20131860), English poet", "*Robert Story (minister) (1790\u20131859), Scottish minister", "*Robert Story (politician) (born 1952), American politician", "*Robert Story (botanist) (1913\u20131999), South African botanist"]}, {"page": "Mary Hogarth", "response": ["Hogarth was described by those who knew her as \"sweet, beautiful and light-hearted\". When Robert Story visited the Hogarth household in 1836, he described Hogarth as \"the fairest flower of spring\". Dickens showed particular affection to Hogarth, and described her as \"a close friend, an exceptional sister, a companion at home.\" It is believed that Hogarth was the first person to read The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist, as Dickens valued Hogarth's input and feedback more than his wife's."]}]}}
