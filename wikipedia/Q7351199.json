He was educated at Clifton College and read history at New College, Oxford. In 1896, he fought in the Second Matabele War, and worked alongside Cecil Rhodes as a war correspondent.He qualified as a solicitor in 1897. In 1899, he married Mary Helene Marten, a fellow Oxford student who, like him, collected photographs and reproductions of works of art. Their joint collection, eventually surpassing 500,000 items, was housed in their home at 32 Portman Square, London.\n\nThe Witt Library, as the couple referred to it, was the world's largest archive of reproductions of paintings and drawings, and turned their home into an international study center for scholars of art history. The collection was bequeathed to The Courtauld Institute upon the couple's death in 1952.\nIn 1902, Witt wrote How to Look at Pictures, a practical guide for the layperson. He joined the National Art Collections Fund in 1903 and was its second chairman from 1921 to 1945. In the King's Birthday Honours 1918 Witt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in the New Year Honours 1922 was appointed a Knight Bachelor.He died at his home in London, aged 80.His work on artists lives on in A Checklist of Painters from c1200-1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malvern, Worcestershire", "response": ["Paintings of Malvern include Little Malvern Church by Joseph Farington now held by the Royal Academy, and a squared drawing by the art historian Robert Witt in the collection of the Courtauld Institute, Joseph Powell's Great Malvern Priory\u00a0... from the North East (1797), now in the British Watercolours collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum."]}, {"page": "The Courtauld Institute of Art", "response": ["The Courtauld was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector Samuel Courtauld, the diplomat and collector Lord Lee of Fareham, and the art historian Sir Robert Witt.", "The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which started as the private collections of two benefactors: the Conway Library, covering architecture, architectural drawings, sculpture and illuminated manuscripts, named after the Lord Conway of Allington and the Witt Library, after Sir Robert Witt, covering paintings, drawings and engravings and containing over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.

The Gallery Director referred the offer to William Herbert Ifould, Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales, in August 1932. Ifould wrote directly to Sir Robert Witt indicating that the bowl was not required by the Library as a very similar one was already held. Ifould received a reply dated 31October 1932, stating that during the intervening months the owner of the bowl in England \u2013 whose name was undisclosed \u2013 had since sold the bowl to another undisclosed buyer. The bowl's subsequent whereabouts was unknown until 1988. In the original offer by Sir Robert \u2013 who had also co-founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London \u2013 a suggestion was made that this bowl had been made to the order of Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales (in office 1788\u20131795) who established the settlement at Sydney Cove.
