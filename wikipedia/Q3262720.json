Molloy spent most of his later teenage years honing his skills, and was only 18 when he opened his first, Manchester-based tattoo shop, which in the next decade would become a world class establishment.Molloy has been recognized twice with UK Outstanding Artist of the Year awards.In 2007, Molloy became a part of the Discovery Channel's television team with the programme London Ink.
