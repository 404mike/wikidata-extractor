In literature, the battle has played a central role in the 1968 novel Sea Road to Camperdown by Showell Styles, and the 1975 novel The Fireship by C. Northcote Parkinson. The battle also inspired composers, such as Daniel Steibelt, whose composition Britannia: An Allegorical Overture was created in honour of the victory and Jan Ladislav Dussek, who created a composition entitled The Naval Battle and Total Defeat of the Dutch by Admiral Duncan in 1797."]}, {"page": "Mather Brown", "response": ["In 1784, he painted two religious paintings for the church of St. Mary\u2019s-in-the-Strand, which led Brown to found a partnership with the painter Daniel Orme for the commercialization of these and other works through exhibition and the sale of engravings. Among these were large paintings of scenes from English history, as well as scenes from Shakespeare's plays. However, despite their success he began to concentrate on portraiture. His first successes were with American sitters, among others his patron John Adams and family in 1784\u201385; this painting is now in the Boston Athen\u00e6um. In the spring of 1786, he began painting the earliest known portrait of Thomas Jefferson, who was visiting London. He also painted Charles Bulfinch the same year. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1798."]}, {"page": "John Blair (painter)", "response": ["* Trinity House, Leith \u2013 Portrait in oil of Edward Brown (d. 1801) copied from a watercolour by Daniel Orme."]}, {"page": "Orme, Daniel", "response": ["#redirectDaniel Orme"]}]}}
