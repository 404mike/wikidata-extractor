Oldham started the match quickly when Adam Virgo brought down Chris Taylor in the penalty box, allowing Andy Liddell to convert a spot-kick for a 1\u20130 Latics advantage in the 9th minute. However, Steven Thomson slid a ball past the Oldham defence to Glenn Murray who fired a shot into the roof of the net, putting the Seagulls back level at 1\u20131. Adam Virgo, who received a yellow card for his tackle of Taylor, received a second in the 48th minute and was sent off. Despite having only ten men, the Brighton defence frustrated the Latics, holding on for a 1\u20131 draw. A week later, the Latics traveled to face Peterborough United at London Road Stadium. This game was again off to a quick start, however, it was the opposition who struck first. A shot from Aaron McLean in the 12th minute deflected off Latics defender Stefan Stam, giving Peterborough a 1\u20130 lead. Eight minutes before the halftime break, McLean extended the lead with another goal with a rebound from a spot-kick, shortly after having another spot-kick saved by Oldham goalkeeper Greg Fleming. After several comebacks throughout the season, Oldham again showed their intentions when Lee Hughes poked the ball into the opposition's net for a 2\u20131 halftime lead for Peterborough. Just before the hour mark, Hughes again scored when he put a loose ball into the net. With several more chances for both sides, the game ended with a 2\u20132 draw. After two consecutive draws, Oldham was set to face Leyton Orient. Despite early efforts from Danny Whitaker and Darren Byfield, Oldham was unable to net an early goal. A Leyton Orient goal looked possible when Adam Chambers got a rebound twelve yards out, but the midfielder sent the ball high over the net. After Byfield was pulled down in the penalty area by Tamika Mkandawire, Andy Liddell struck his 8th goal of the season via a penalty kick for a 1\u20130 halftime advantage. Near the midway point of the second half, Greg Fleming gave Orient a chance to get back on level terms when he fouled Ryan Jarvis in the box. Fleming saved the penalty, but Jason Demetriou scored from a rebound, earning Leyton Orient a 1\u20131 draw\u2014Oldham's third consecutive. Oldham was away to face Crewe Alexandra under new manager Gudjon Thordarson on Boxing Day. Despite struggling with an illness just days before the match, Darren Byfield was named to the starting lineup. Just before the hour mark in the match, Byfield scored his first for the club from a through back from Kelvin Lomax. The win was secured when Lee Hughes curled a ball past Stuart Tomlinson, before Hughes grabbed another five minutes before the final whistle for a 3\u20130 win. Two days after the Boxing Day victory, Oldham faced off against Carlisle United for the final match of 2008. Terrific play from Carlisle goalkeeper Tim Krul kept Oldham out of goal, despite giving the Latics nineteen corners. Neither side had an attacking threat until 17 minutes in when a Reuben Hazell header forced Krul into a saved shot. With nineteen total shots for the Latics, manager John Sheridan was surprised when the game ended in a scoreless draw."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 FA Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Steven Thomson"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Steven Thomson || St Mirren || 1 January 2009 || Free"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["Hibs began the 2009\u201310 league season with a 2\u20131 win against St Mirren, who had Steven Thomson sent off early in the match. Although Hibs conceded the first goal due to a series of defensive errors, David Wotherspoon scored a quick equaliser on his senior debut and Abdessalam Benjelloun scored a late winner. Inconsistent form in the early part of the season saw Hibs win their first two games, lose the next two, but then win the following two league matches. These results put Hibs tied with Rangers on points for second place in the league, but manager John Hughes commented that it would be a position that Hibs would be unlikely to hold for the rest of the season. Hughes put this inconsistency down to the team's failure to work hard enough in the games they had lost."]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Steven Thomson||||MF||1995\u20132000||122||4||||"]}, {"page": "2010 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["The Buddies dominated the first half, Steven Thomson and David Barron coming close to breaking the deadlock.
