A friend of Edward Elgar (who dedicated the fifth of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches to him) and Ralph Vaughan Williams, he was involved in the first performance of Vaughan Williams' Two Hymn Preludes and Prelude and Fugue in C minor for Orchestra.\nHull was a chorister at Hereford Cathedral under Langdon Colborne and George Robertson Sinclair. He was afterwards a pupil of Dr Sinclair and assistant organist of Hereford Cathedral from 1896-1914. He was in Germany at the outbreak of the Great War and interned as a civil prisoner of war at Ruhleben. He was appointed organist of Hereford Cathedral on Armistice Day 1918.
