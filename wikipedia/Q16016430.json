He played in 21 matches as a left-handed batsman (1947\u20131951). \nFairbairn was awarded his county cap in 1947 when he was a member of the Middlesex team that won the County Championship. He scored 776 runs in first-class cricket with a highest score of 110 not out, one of two centuries.He died in Enfield, Middlesex on 7 March 2005 aged 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["As Playfair put it, \"few will dispute that the best side won the championship\". Middlesex's first four batsmen \u2014 Robertson, Brown, Edrich and Compton \u2014 scored between them 12,193 runs in all first-class matches, a level of success unprecedented in county cricket. The other batting positions were contested by George Mann, who was heir-apparent to Robins as club captain and succeeded him in 1948; Alan Fairbairn, a 1947 debutant who scored centuries in each of his first two county matches; Harry Sharp and Alec Thompson. The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. Ian Bedford, aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. Playfair noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success.Playfair, pp. 84\u201385. Middlesex made exclusive use of Lord's Cricket Ground in St John's Wood, north London, for their thirteen home matches."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Alan Fairbairn (1948) : A.
