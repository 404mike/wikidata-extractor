However, he suffered a finger injury and the move to Gretna did not take place. On 17 August 2007, he signed forLeague Two club Hereford United on an initial one-month contract as cover for Wayne Brown, which was later extended until the end of 2007\u201308. His debut came in the Football League Trophy at home to Yeovil Town on 9 October 2007, which Hereford lost 4\u20132 in a penalty shoot-out after a 0\u20130 draw after extra time, with Ingham making \"good saves\" from Kevin Betsy and Simon Gillett. He picked up a hand injury in March 2008 that was expected to keep him out of the team for six weeks, meaning he finished the season with one appearance."]}, {"page": "Paul Harrison (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["After Harrison left Chester, he joined newly promoted League Two team Hereford United.

Six days later, he left Edgar Street on a free transfer to Conference National team Southport."]}, {"page": "2006 Conference National play-off Final", "response": ["Minutes into extra time, Halifax had a goal disallowed for offside and the tempo of the match slowed down as players tired. Then in the 109th minute of the match Hereford won a throw in. Substitute Stuart Fleetwood received the ball from Ryan Green but was tackled. The ball ran loose to Green who deftly clipped the ball into the far corner of the goal with his left foot, scoring what was only the second senior goal of his career. With eleven minutes to go it looked as if Hereford had done enough for victory. However the drama was not over as Hereford goalkeeper Wayne Brown received a head injury after going for a ball. With all substitutions now made it looked at one stage as though Hereford would need an emergency goalkeeper, and midfielder Ferrell even had a spare goalkeeper's jersey on for a moment. But, after several minutes, Brown recovered and play resumed although there was six minutes of stoppage time added on. Halifax tried everything to equalise, putting centre-back Adam Quinn up front who had a shot destined for the top corner well saved by Brown.", "|GK ||14||Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown", "response": ["Wayne Brown may refer to:", "* Wayne Brown (ice hockey) (1930\u20132019), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Wayne Brown (politician) (1936\u20132013), American politician and accountant", "* Wayne Brown (author) (1944\u20132009), writer born in Trinidad and Tobago", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born January 1977), English football goalkeeper", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born August 1977), English football defender", "* Wayne Brown (footballer, born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Chris Dunn (footballer)", "response": ["During the 2009\u201310 season, Dunn was the regular goalkeeper and went on a run of five clean sheets in a row without conceding a goal in 524 minutes.

This record ended on 26 January 2010 when he conceded a goal against Darlington from Tadhg Purcell despite winning 2\u20131.

Alex Smith gave Vale an eighth minute lead with a drilled effort from long-range, Tony Naylor then provided an assist for Steve Brooker to double the advantage before putting the game beyond County on 59 minutes; Smith later won a penalty, which was missed by Tommy Widdrington. Vale then had a home tie with Conference club Chester City \u2013 who had suffered relegation from the Football League the previous season \u2013 and made the two division gap show with a confident performance; Chester defender Matt Doughty put a Smith cross into his own net on the 21st-minute and only some excellent goalkeeping from Wayne Brown kept the score down, he conceded just one further goal after Naylor struck the net from a Dave Brammer cross. Third Division strugglers Darlington failed to provide much stiffer competition in the area quarter-finals, as Onandi Lowe netted on his debut, followed by a headed goal from Allen Tankard and a brace from Naylor, giving the Vale a 4\u20130 victory."]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown (goalkeeper)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Brown (footballer, born January 1977)"]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown (footballer born January 1977)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Brown (footballer, born January 1977)"]}, {"page": "Wayne Brown (goalkeeper, born 1977)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Brown (footballer, born January 1977)"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wayne Brown"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wayne Brown"]}]}}
