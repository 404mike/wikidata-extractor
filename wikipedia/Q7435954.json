He made his Orient debut on 7 August 1999, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Carlisle United at Brunton Park. He played regularly during the first half of the campaign, but lost his place to Scott Barrett after a 1\u20130 loss to Reading in the Football League Trophy on 8 December 1999. He eventually won his first-team place back towards the latter stages of the season, and played in Orient's last nine league matches, making 21 appearances in all competitions in his first season with the East London club. The 2000\u201301 season was Bayes' most successful season at Leyton Orient, where he made 51 appearances in all competitions as Orient finished the season in fifth place. He also played in their play-off campaign, as the club lost 4\u20132 to Blackpool in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in May 2001. Bayes made just 14 appearances the following season as a persistent shoulder injury hampered his last season with the club.
