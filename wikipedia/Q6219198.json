A copy in the British Museum, dated 1750, and assigned in the catalogue to Henry Ballow, belonged to Francis Hargrave. A note in Hargrave's handwriting states that it was ascribed to Mr. Bellewe, and first published in 1737. Hargrave adds that Mr. Bellewe was a man of learning and devoted to classical literature, and that his manuscript law collections were in the possession of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, who was his executor and literary legatee. John Anthony Fonblanque, however, in his edition of the treatise on equity (1794), thinks that the book could not have been written by a man of less than ten years' standing, and that Ballow, who could have been only thirty years of age at the time of its publication, would have openly claimed it if it had been his. Fonblanque calls him Henry Ballow. A Henry Ballow, possibly father of this Ballow, was deputy chamberlain in the exchequer in 1703."]}, {"page": "Fonblanque", "response": ["*John Anthony Fonblanque (1759\u20131837), politician;"]}, {"page": "John de Grenier Fonblanque", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Anthony Fonblanque"]}, {"page": "Edward Barrington de Fonblanque", "response": ["Edward was born in Calais to Thomas de Grenier de Fonblanque, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General and  Consul-General to Serbia, and Jane Catherine Barrington of Dublin.
