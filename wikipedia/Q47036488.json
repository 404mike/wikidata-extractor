Graeme Auld (1998) concluded that Judges 1 was not an early document, but composed on the basis of several notes scattered throughout the Book of Joshua, and that the author attributes the northern tribes' troubled history to their failures during the conquest period. Similarly, K. Lawson Younger (1995) made the case that the composition of Judges 1 was dependent on text taken from Joshua 13\u201319 and reused for the author's own purposes: 'Judges 1 recapitulates, recasts and extends the story of the process of Israel's taking possession of the land of Canaan. It utilizes materials from the book of Joshua (esp. Josh. 13\u201319) with some expansions to explicitly reflect the general success of Judah and the increasing failure of the other Israelite tribes, especially Dan.' Younger therefore cautioned against taking Judges 1 as historically reliable just because it seems more credible than Joshua 10\u201311, because Judges 1 shows clear signs of deliberately twisting the material of Joshua 13\u201319 in favour of Judah and Joseph at the expense of the other Israelite tribes, and attributes the latter's failures to moral degeneration."]}, {"page": "Graeme Auld", "response": ["#REDIRECT A.
