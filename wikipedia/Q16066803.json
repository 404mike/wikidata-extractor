The touring team won the match by an innings and 330 runs."]}, {"page": "Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)", "response": ["In the winter of 1902\u201303, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand representative side, and in all matches scored 148 runs at an average of 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention.  In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: \"When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets.\"Parkinson, p. 29. However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: \"You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that.\" Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games."]}, {"page": "Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1902\u201303", "response": ["The team was as follows: Warner opened the batting; his opening partner was Cambridge University alumni and MCC cricketer Cuthbert Burnup, a right-handed batsman and useful right-arm slow bowler; Fane, a right-handed batsman for England and Essex; Tom Taylor, a Yorkshire right-hand batsman and wicketkeeper; Edward Dowson, of Surrey; leading all-round cricketer Bosanquet; George Thompson of Northamptonshire and John Stanning of the MCC; Randall Johnson of the MCC; Arthur Whatman who also kept wicket; Albert Leatham and Sam Hargreave. Nat Williams, who was living in New Zealand at the time, played in seven of the minor matches in New Zealand when members of the original team were injured or otherwise unavailable.", "Four more minor provincial games followed: Wairarapa, Marlborough, Nelson and Westland. Then Hawke's team defeated Canterbury by 133 runs on 6 February, with half-centuries for Warner and Burnup, and then Otago by an innings and 230 runs on 13 February, with a five-wicket haul for Burnup and a double-century for Warner. There was controversy during the Canterbury match. Bosanquet was the fourth bowler used in by Hawke's team during the second innings and with his third ball, it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle.
