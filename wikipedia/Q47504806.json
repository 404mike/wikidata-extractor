She reported the frustrations of highly qualified women who felt constrained to stop working once they married or to care for their children; she concluded that women who sacrificed themselves and their capacity for self-actualisation to become full-time mothers and wives instead were \"often too self-sacrificing in the sense that they let themselves drift into a state of mind in which their daily lives gradually destroy them as individuals\".Judith Hubback, Wives Who Went to College (1957), pp. 150\u20131, cited in McCarthy, p. 284. Hubback argued that women could balance motherhood, marriage and work only through the full support of their husbands.Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska (ed.), Women in Twentieth-Century Britain: Social, Cultural and Political Change (Longman, 2001), p. 126. Wives Who Went to College was the subject of much discussion: it received 87 reviews in published material and was the subject of leading articles in The Times and The Economist.McCarthy, p. 288."]}, {"page": "Pearl Jephcott", "response": ["In 1942, Jephcott was given leave by the National Association of Girls' Clubs to carry out research into girls' experiences of growing up in England and Wales. She collected information on the work and home life, leisure and relationships of 153 girls aged 14 to 18, the results of which were reported in Jephcott's first book: Girls Growing Up (1942). She followed this up the next year with Clubs for Girls, which provided a guide on organising clubs. She was awarded a Barnett Fellowship to carry out a follow-up study of the girls she spoke to in 1942, and produced Rising Twenties in 1948 as a result. She then worked for Political and Economic Planning, before joining the University of Nottingham in 1950 to oversee research projects, one of which examined youth groups and was published as Some Young People (1954). That year she became a Senior Research Assistant at the London School of Economics, working under Richard Titmuss alongside Nancy Seear and John Smith. They investigated married women in employment in Bermondsey and she focused on home life. The result was Married Women Working, published in 1962. In the view of Helen McCarthy, this study meant that Jephcott was one of a number of researchers in the 1950s and early 1960s (such as Seear, Viola Klein, Ferdynand Zweig, Judith Hubback and Hannah Gavron) who \"helped to entrench new understandings of married women\u2019s employment as a fundamental feature of advanced industrial societies, and one that solved the dilemmas of 'modern' woman across social classes.\"Helen McCarthy, \"Social Science and Married Women\u2019s Employment in Post-War Britain\", Past and Present, vol. 233, no. 1 (2016), p. 270."]}]}}
