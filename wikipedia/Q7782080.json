As he could not carry the officer by himself, he fetched volunteers, one of whom was killed almost at once, and heavy fire necessitated leaving the wounded man in a shell hole until dusk when Private Veale went out again with volunteers. When an enemy patrol approached, he went back for a Lewis gun with which he covered the party while the officer was carried to safety.He later achieved the rank of corporal. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Keep Military Museum, Dorchester, Dorset.", "link_mentions": {}}}
