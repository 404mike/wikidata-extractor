The suggestion that there is growing \u2018concern\u2019 about the validity of the serious health issues associated with obesity is really quite bizarre, as there has been the most remarkable and growing consensus among an extensive range of governments, academics, health economists, and policy makers relating to the impact of excess weight gain.\" June Stevens, Jill E.

Out of this work, Martin was invited by the then secretary of state for health, Patricia Hewitt, to form in 2007 a \"national advisory group\" on the universal psychological principles and standards underpinning good mental health care. Martin was able to convene a group of distinguished thinkers from the full range of psychological approaches to produce a guiding document. Group members included Susie Orbach, Andrew Samuels, Lucy Johnstone and Valerie Sinason. The core recommendations of this group took account of all psychological theory and spiritual factors in the human condition. \"Psychological mindedness\" was the concept and the phrase that seemed to bind everything together. This work has led to the formation of a further national working group (2008) on the back of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative in the UK. This new working group is looking at \"10 high impact changes\" for mental health policy in the UK that will increase psychological mindedness.
