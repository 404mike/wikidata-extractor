However, the ship was quickly inundated with water and it sank in  of water, about  away from the mainland. The two lifeboats were lowered during the confusion of the sinking, but both were swamped with water. The first mate had talked with the captain at this time, and the captain was upset at the launching of the lifeboats without his knowledge or guidance. The mate stated that the captain's last words were \"Alas, alas, we are all going to the bottom.\" At 5:00\u00a0am of 20 July, the paddle steamer Martello arrived at the scene of the sinking and picked up some survivors as well as at least six bodies. After staying at the scene for several hours, the Martello sailed to Leith and took the bodies with her, as well as the survivors, two of whom, Bailey (or Baillie) and Hildyard, were passengers. The other four survivors were from her crew; the mate, the engineer, the carpenter and one seaman. One of those who drowned, was the renowned 19th-century actor Edward William Elton. After his death was announced, several appeals to raise money for his family were launched, which had Charles Dickens in an overseer role."]}]}}
