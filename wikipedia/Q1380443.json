Chapman also presided over off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit; a Tube station was named after the club; and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, in the middle of the 1933\u201334 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937\u201338 title."]}, {"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["Although he did not win any major honours as a player, as a manager Chapman won a Southern League title in 1908\u201309 with Northampton Town, four Football League titles (1923\u201324 and 1924\u201325 with Huddersfield Town, 1930\u201331 and 1932\u201333 with Arsenal) and two FA Cups (1921\u201322 with Huddersfield Town, 1929\u201330 with Arsenal). After his death the team he had built at Arsenal, under his successors Joe Shaw and George Allison, went on to win the 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335 titles, emulating his Huddersfield Town team by completing a hat-trick. No team was to repeat the feat until Liverpool between 1982 and 1984. Chapman was honorary president of Scottish amateur football club Chirnside United until his death in 1934."]}, {"page": "George Allison", "response": ["After the sudden death of legendary Arsenal boss Herbert Chapman earlier in January 1934, Allison was appointed Chapman's full-time successor in the summer of that year. Under Chapman and caretaker manager Joe Shaw, Arsenal had already won the League Championship twice in a row, in 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334, and Allison made it a hat-trick, winning a third successive title in 1934\u201335. He also won the FA Cup in 1935\u201336 and the League again in 1937\u201338.", "Allison took a hands-off approach to managing, unlike his predecessor Chapman; Joe Shaw and Tom Whittaker took charge of training and squad discipline, while Allison concentrated on transfer policy and the club's relationship with the media. Arsenal player Bernard Joy later recounted: \"[He was] tactful, friendly and good-hearted. But he fell short in his handling of footballers and lacked the professional's deep knowledge of the game\". Allison's proponents have cited the trophies won under his reign, though by the end of the 1930s Arsenal were no longer the all-conquering team that they had once been. Allison was unable to replace many of the stars from the first half of the decade, especially Alex James."]}, {"page": "Joseph Shaw", "response": ["Joseph or Joe Shaw may refer to:", "*Joe Shaw (rugby union) (born 1980), Newcastle Falcons rugby union player", "*Joe Shaw (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u2013?), forward for Sunderland, Hull City and Grimsby Town", "*Joe Shaw (footballer, born 1883) (1883\u20131963), left back for Arsenal and was later caretaker manager at the club", "*Joe Shaw (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132007), centre half for Sheffield United"]}]}}
