In addition, he and his wife, Jung Chang, with whom he lives in Notting Hill, West London, researched and wrote a biography of Mao Zedong, Mao: the Unknown Story. The book was highly-praised  in the popular press. Some scholars offered measured praise of the range of scholarship, but more prevalent criticism on factual accuracy, methodology and use of sources.Halliday is the older brother of the late Irish International relations academic and writer Fred Halliday.He was educated at University of Oxford and has been married to Jung Chang since 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Democide", "response": ["Rummel's numbers should not be considered factual, as they are inflated.

We cannot expect near this accuracy for the victims of communism. We can, however, get a probable order of magnitude and a relative approximation of these deaths within a most likely range.\" In 1994, Rummel updated his estimates for Communist regimes at about 110 million people, foreign and domestic, killed by Communist democide from 1900 to 1987. Due to additional information about Mao Zedong's culpability in the Great Chinese Famine according to Mao: The Unknown Story, a 2005 book authored by Jon Halliday and Jung Chang, Rummel revised upward his total for Communist democide to about 148 million, using their estimate of 38 million famine deaths."]}, {"page": "Mao Zedong", "response": ["Jung Chang and Jon Halliday claim that the uprising was in fact sabotaged by Mao to allow him to prevent a group of KMT soldiers from defecting to any other CCP leader.Chang, Halliday; Mao, Chapt.5 Chang and Halliday also claim that Mao talked the other leaders (including Russian diplomats at the Soviet consulate in Changsha who, Chang and Halliday claim, had been controlling much of the CCP activity) into striking only at Changsha, then abandoning it.

MacFarquhar and Schoenhals assert that in rural China alone some 36\u00a0million people were persecuted, of whom between 750,000 and 1.5\u00a0million were killed, with roughly the same number permanently injured.

They say that Mao was well aware that his policies would be responsible for the deaths of millions. While discussing labour-intensive projects such as waterworks and making steel, Mao said to his inner circle in November 1958: \"Working like this, with all these projects, half of China may well have to die.

Regarding the large-scale irrigation projects, Dik\u00f6tter stresses that, in spite of Mao being in a good position to see the human cost, they continued unabated for several years, and ultimately claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted villagers.
