It was created on 21 June 1911 for the industrialist and Liberal politician Sir Charles McLaren, 1st Baronet.  He had already been created a baronet, of Bodnant, Gwylgre and Hilders, on 24 July 1902.His eldest son, the second Baron, was a businessman and also sat as a Member of Parliament.  He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron.  In August 1939, the future third Baron was part of a secret delegation sent to Germany by Lord Halifax to offer Adolf Hitler concessions on the assurance that he would not invade Poland. Since 2003, the title passed to his eldest son, the fourth Baron. \nAs of 17 December 2019, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.  However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage.\nFor more information, follow this link.\nAberconway is the anglicised form of the Welsh place name Aberconwy, the original name of Conwy town in Welsh.\nThe family seat is Bodnant House, near Tal-y-Cafn, Conwy, Wales. The traditional burial place of the Lords Aberconway is a mausoleum called \"The Poem\" within Bodnant Garden.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
