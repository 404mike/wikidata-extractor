He entered the British Army in 1762 and served in the American War of Independence, where he was taken prisoner at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. He also fought in the French Revolutionary Wars but is best remembered for his role during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was in overall command at the Battle of Arklow and commanded one of the five columns at the Battle of Vinegar Hill. In 1804, he was appointed Colonel of the 5th Royal Veteran Battalion. He was promoted to colonel for life of the 86th Foot in 1810 and to general in 1812.\nFrom 1806 to 1818 Kilmorey also represented Newry in the House of Commons. He succeeded his elder brother in the viscountcy in 1818 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. In 1822 he was honoured when he was made Viscount Newry and Mourne, in the County of Down, and Earl of Kilmorey. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland.\nLord Kilmorey married Anne, daughter of Thomas Fisher (1765-1816), in 1787. They had two sons and eight daughters:\nFrancis, 2nd Earl of Kilmorey (1787-1880)\nLady Frances Margaretta Anne (1789-1789)\nLady Anna Maria Elizabeth (1790-1866)\nLady Amelia (1791-1860)\nLady Frances Elizabeth (1792-1890)\nLady Selina (1794-1876)\nLady Georgiana (1795-1888)\nLady Alicia Mary (1796-1885)\nFrancis Henry William (1799-1868)\nLady Mabella Josephine (1801-1899)He died in November 1832, aged 84, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son Francis.", "link_mentions": {}}}
