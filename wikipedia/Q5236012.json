His carved plaques and inscriptions in stone and slate can be seen on many churches and public buildings in the United Kingdom.

Along with his friend and collaborator Jacob Epstein, Gill planned the construction in the Sussex countryside of a colossal, hand-carved monument in imitation of the large-scale structures at Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Throughout the second half of 1910 Epstein and Gill would met on an almost daily basis. Earlier in the year they had held long discussions with Rothenstein and other artists, including Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy, about the formation of a quasi-religious brotherhood. At Ditchling, Epstein worked on elements of Oscar Wilde's tomb in Pere Lachaise cemetery for which Gill designed the inscription before sending Joseph Cribb to Paris to carve the lettering. Cribb had come to Ditchling with Gill in 1907. Other apprentices included David Jones, David Kindersley (who in turn became a successful sculptor and engraver) and his nephew, John Skelton, Laurie Cribb, Donald Potter and Walter Ritchie."]}, {"page": "St Cyprian's School", "response": ["*David Kindersley (1915\u20131995) \u2013 stonecutter, typeface designer"]}, {"page": "Road signs in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Legally street name signs are not defined as traffic signs in the United Kingdom; this therefore gives authorities flexibility on the design and placement of them.
