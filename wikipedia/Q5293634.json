Ed Greenwood called the book a disappointment, citing its lack of detail and \"breaches of consistency\". He felt that there were many incomplete or inadequate monster entries, and also criticized the book for having too many new undead and too many new races. Greenwood, however, did consider the slaad, elemental princes of evil, and penanggalan \"worthy additions to any campaign\" and noted that the previously published drow and kuo-toa were \"expected attractions, but good to see nonetheless.\" Contributor Alan Zumwait also reviewed the book, noting that a few of the inclusions were \"just Monster Manual creatures that are changed or crossbred with other monsters.\"  He was pleased by the inclusion of the neutral Oriental dragons, but felt that their descriptions were inferior to those of the dragons in the Monster Manual.  He also liked the slaad and elemental princes of evil, but felt they should both have counterparts of other alignments. Zumwait summed up his review by stating, \"the FIEND FOLIO Tome is like a basket of peaches: Most of it is pretty good stuff, but part of it is the pits.\" At the urging of Kim Mohan, Don Turnbull wrote a rebuttal, which was printed in the same issue.  Turnbull cited the publication's legal holdups, and the AD&D game's evolution during that time, as part of the reason for the work's inconsistencies.
