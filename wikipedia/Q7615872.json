Though Bernstein has described Hitchcock as the film's director, the Imperial War Museum describes Hitchcock as the film's \"treatment advisor,\" noting that his one-month participation did not begin until after the footage was already shot and he was not involved in the rough cut of the film. Tanner also described Hitchcock as an advisor on the film and not as its director. Among the guidance Hitchcock provided was to recommend that the film avoid tricky editing to enhance its credibility, and to use wherever possible long shots and panning. He also recommended that German villagers be shown visiting the camps, and suggested showing scenes at Auschwitz showing piles of hair, wedding rings, spectacles and toothbrushes. Hitchcock told the filmmakers that these steps were necessary because many people would not believe the film and would accuse the Allies of faking the film."]}, {"page": "Night Will Fall", "response": ["The director Alfred Hitchcock was recruited for the film. The documentary includes a recording of an interview with him about this project. While he worked on it a short time, commentators believe that he strongly influenced its shape and expression. This documentary also includes clips of interviews with surviving cameramen who had filmed at the concentration camps after, or during, liberation. It recounts the production of German Concentration Camps Factual Survey, which included the assembling of a team that included \"perhaps the best known film editor in London,\" Stewart McAllister, Hitchcock and Richard Crossman."]}]}}
