Brayford kept his place when the 2010\u201311 Championship season began, and played every minute of all Derby's 48 league and cup matches during the season. Although primarily employed as a right back, consistent injuries to other members of the Derby defence saw Brayford employed at centre-back and left-back through the course of the campaign. Earning plaudits for his ability to combine an attacking role with his defensive duties, Brayford scored once (in a 4\u20131 home victory over Watford) and assisted three times, and was considered one of the star performers as Derby initially challenged for promotion (being 4th in the table in November 2010) before a run of 4 wins in 24 games saw them plummet down to 19th in the table by the end of April.

There was also interest in other Derby players, with Ipswich Town making a bid for Paul Connolly which was rejected and Rob Hulse the subject of a \u00a34m+ bid from Middlesbrough. Hulse rejected the opportunity to move, citing his fondness for club as the reason.

An additional striker was eventually brought into the club with the loan signing of Everton youngster James Vaughan until January 2010 on 18 September.

The Ipswich result was compounded by Stephen Pearson earning a two match ban after being sent off for foul and abusive language and manager Nigel Clough earning a charge of improper conduct after he was sent to the stands. He was fined \u00a31,000 and given a one-match ban which he served during the final game of the campaign against Cardiff City. A 0\u20130 draw with Barnsley left the club needing just a point from its final three games to guarantee survival, which duly arrived with a 1\u20131 draw with Crystal Palace on 17 April 2010. This meant that it was not possible for both Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday to overtake The Rams as they played each other at Hillsborough on the final day of the season and ensured safety and Derby's place in the 2010\u201311 Football League Championship. Safety meant that Steve Davies and Stephen Bywater were both rested for the remainder of the campaign, Davies having an ankle operation and Bywater resting a sprained rib joint. Bywater's injury resulted in Ross Atkins being recalled from a loan spell with Kidderminster Harriers. Paul Connolly, who Sheffield United loan was initially extended for another week, returned when it became mathematically impossible for Sheffield United to make the playoffs. The season's away fixtures wrapped up with The Rams 13th away defeat of the campaign as the lost 2\u20131 at Bristol City, meaning Derby had taken just 17 points from a possible 69 on the road. Derby's goalscorer in the game, Stephen Pearson, also underwent knee surgery, ruling him out for four months. Leading scorer Rob Hulse also had an operation on his adductor tendon problem leaving Derby with 14 senior players ruled out for the final game of the season against Cardiff City. One of these, loanee Gilles Sunu, was returned to his parent club, Arsenal, one week early due to the injury.
