He wrote mainly for British newspapers the Yorkshire Post and the Yorkshire Evening Post. Considered by critics to be one of the greatest authorities in the country on his two sports, he wrote a daily column using his pseudonym \"Old Ebor\" for 40 years. Most often associated with his reporting on Yorkshire County Cricket Club, he has been credited as defining the role of a sports journalist. Two of his most widely known works were on cricket: Talks with Old English Cricketers and History of Yorkshire County Cricket, 1903\u201323.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe", "response": ["Sutcliffe's career advanced in 1923 when he made his first appearances in the North v South and Gentlemen v Players fixtures and in a Test Trial.  His overall record in 1923 was 2,220 runs at 41.11 with 3 centuries, 15 fifties and a highest score of 139 against Somerset.  The Yorkshire cricket historian Alfred Pullin wrote: \"it was recognised long before the season ended that Sutcliffe had established his claim to be considered one of England's first-wicket batsmen\".Hill, p.52."]}, {"page": "Roy Kilner", "response": ["In terms of bowling, Kilner was an effective performer on rain affected pitches. His accuracy also enabled him to bowl on good pitches without the batsmen being able to score too many runs. In 1923, journalist Alfred Pullin said Kilner spun the ball more than any other English bowler. He noted, as did Wisden, how Kilner often bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets, unusual for a left-arm spinner in this period. This established a contrast with his fellow left-arm spinner, Wilfred Rhodes, and increased their effectiveness. Furthermore, it allowed him to surprise batsmen with a different delivery, such as one which did not turn.Pope, pp. 35\u201336. Kilner's Wisden portrait also credited him with the gift of imagination, describing how he always tried to think of new ways to beat and dismiss batsmen. He would experiment with his bowling, for example altering his pace slightly, if conditions were unfavourable towards bowlers. Kilner delivered left-arm wrist spin at times, constantly practising it in the cricket nets. His brother Norman believed Roy was the person who coined the term \"chinaman\" to describe such a style, although other players have also claimed to originate the phrase."]}, {"page": "Abe Waddington", "response": ["On his return in 1924, Waddington bowled little in his first matches, but was used more in Yorkshire's defeat by Middlesex at Lord's where he bowled 42 overs to take three for 116. Several Yorkshire players were absent, playing representative matches, but the game had consequences later in the season.Woodhouse, p. 327.Howe, p. 75. In the return match at Sheffield in July, the Yorkshire players seemed determined to have revenge but could only secure a draw. Critics thought that the Yorkshire bowlers appealed excessively to the umpires, and the Middlesex players were barracked by the crowd. The journalist Alfred Pullin described the match as \"a sorry exhibition of ill feeling and bad manners.\""]}, {"page": "N. S. Ramaswami", "response": ["Ramaswami often wrote under the pseudonyms \"Cardusian\" and \"New Ebor\", the former in honour of Neville Cardus, that doyen of cricket literature, and the latter Alfred Pullin, Victorian-Edwardian cricket correspondent for the Yorkshire Post, whose pseudonym was \"Old Ebor\".  He was most popularly known, however, by the initials NSR. One of the most subtle and observant writers on the game, Ramaswami's work is celebrated even today.  \"What he lacked,\" wrote Suresh Menon in an otherwise laudatory piece, \"was what some modern writers consider more important than style or flair \u2014 a harsh line in criticism.  His writing was suggestive rather than brazen, his criticism based on larger principles rather than on passing trends.\""]}, {"page": "Ted Pooley", "response": ["After his cricket career, Pooley, as with so many of his contemporary cricketers, struggled financially and his gambling and drinking eventually led to the Lambeth workhouse.  In 1899 the writer Alfred Pullin traced and interviewed many old cricketers.  He described Pooley's hands as \"mere lumps of deformity\" and attributed their condition to rheumatism caused by drink. Pooley became angry at this, banging the table to show he had no feeling in his fingers and that it was cricket rather than \"rheumatics\" that had put him in the workhouse.  He took Pullin outside to show he could still catch a ball.  Pooley lived on until 1907, dying in poverty, while his teammates from the 1877 tour were lauded as the first Test cricketers."]}, {"page": "George Freeman (cricketer)", "response": ["Under the pseudonym \"Old Ebor\", Alfred Pullin (1860\u20131934) interviewed eighteen former cricketers for the Yorkshire Evening Post during the winter of 1897/98. After publication in the paper, they were gathered together for a book called Talks With Old Yorkshire Cricketers. Each player interviewed nominated George Freeman as the greatest bowler they had ever seen. W. G. Grace, not interviewed in the book, all but agreed with their judgment, dubbing him the finest fast bowler he had ever opposed. Even after the careers of Tom Richardson, William Lockwood and Walter Brearley were finished in the years before World War I, Freeman, along with John Jackson, was still thought of by cricket historians as among the best four or five fast bowlers to have played the game.Tom Richardson (obituary)"]}, {"page": "John Thewlis senior", "response": ["Like many professional cricketers of his era, Thewlis fell on hard times after the end of his career. When Alfred Pullin, cricket and rugby correspondent for the Yorkshire Evening Post, sought to track him down for one of eighteen interviews with veteran cricketers in the winter of 1897\u201398, he was unable to locate his home. On inquiring of Yorkshire County Cricket Club as to his whereabouts, he was informed, \"think dead; if not, in Manchester\"."]}, {"page": "Old Ebor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alfred Pullin"]}, {"page": "A.

Holmes also topped 2,000 runs in the season and shared in 9\u00a0century stands with Sutcliffe, taking their overall tally to 25 and beating the record of 19 set by John Tunnicliffe and Jack Brown from 1895 to 1903.

The editor of the latter, Arthur Mann, was impressed by Kilburn's work, and arranged to meet him in 1934. Learning of his interest in cricket,  and recognising his name from his success in the Bradford League, Mann gave Kilburn a trial as the newspaper's cricket correspondent; the position had been vacant since Alfred Pullin had retired in 1931. An initial three-month period, with a salary of \u00a33 per week, resulted in a written commendation from Neville Cardus, and he was appointed permanently with responsibility for cricket and rugby."]}]}}
