They became a couple, and as her career as a model took off, he became her manager and helped to make her famous. Twiggy severed ties with him in 1973 and has lately downplayed his role in her success.De Villeneuve was married to model Jan de Villeneuve (born Janet Griswold) and has two daughters, illustrator Daisy de Villeneuve (born 9 May 1975) and photographer Poppy de Villeneuve (born 22 May 1979).\nFrom 1975 to 1977, he co-managed (along with his partner, Rock Manager Bryan Morrison) the British proto-punk rock band Doctors of Madness, led by Richard Strange. In 1978, he became the manager of singer-songwriter Lynsey De Paul, during the period when she recorded her Tigers and Fireflies album, and in 1980 he also managed Clifford T Ward, another U.K. singer-songwriter.De Villeneuve married designer Sue Timney at Chelsea Town Hall in 2007.

De Villeneuve credits himself for Twiggy's discovery and her modelling success, and his version of events is often quoted in other biographies. In her 1998 book Twiggy In Black and White, she says that she met Justin through his brother, when she worked as a Saturday girl at a hairdressers in London. This is where she began to see the models in the magazines, but never thought she could do something like that.

Justin de Villeneuve was Lynsey's manager at the time and the album was recorded at Long View Farm.

The photo was taken midway through the sessions at a Paris studio by her then-manager and partner Justin de Villeneuve; he recalled in 2010: \"Twiggy and I had first heard David mention her on Aladdin Sane... We loved the album so much I called David and asked him if he would like to do a shoot with Twiggy. He jumped at the idea.\" Twiggy recalled in her autobiography In Black and White that she was \"really quite nervous\" meeting Bowie, but \"he immediately put me at ease. He was everything I could have hoped for and more\". During the shoot, Bowie and Twiggy had different skin tones, partially attributed to the latter just returning from holiday in California. The problem was solved by returning Aladdin Sane make-up designer Pierre Laroche, who used make-up masks to balance the tones out. Twiggy found the final result \"enigmatic and strange\", later calling it one of her favourite images and \"possibly the most widely distributed photograph ever taken of me.\" The photo was originally slated to appear in Vogue magazine. Twiggy stated that the photo was met with apprehension from Vogue, who didn't want a man appearing on their front cover, so Bowie opted to use it as the album cover instead; de Villeneuve later recalled Vogue being infuriated by the decision."]}, {"page": "Doctors of Madness", "response": ["In March 1975 the band started playing gigs at a pub in Twickenham, south-west London, where they were spotted by a talent scout for music manager Bryan Morrison, who had managed Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett and Marc Bolan.
