The top two teams would progress directly to the final. England started their campaign against Denmark. Aided by a hat-trick from Carole Hodges\u2014both the first by an Englishwoman in international cricket, and the first at any Women's World Cup\u2014England won by 239 runs; at the time, the second-biggest winning margin in Women's One Day International cricket. In their second match, they faced New Zealand, who only managed to score 127 runs batting first. However, in response, New Zealand enacted five run outs to help secure a 25-run victory. The New Zealand captain, Sarah Illingworth recalled: \"As captain that day I felt as if I knew what was going to happen before it did in the field. [It was the] best fielding performance I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\" The English cricket writer, Raf Nicholson, blamed England rather than praised New Zealand, saying that England \"threw away the game with five suicidal run-outs and unnecessary slogging in between\". England subsequently beat Ireland by 162 runs\u2014during which Hodges and Helen Plimmer both scored centuries for England\u2014and narrowly defeated India, who had only needed four runs to win when their last batter was dismissed. Their results meant that England had to beat Australia to give themselves a realistic chance of reaching the final. England scored 208 for five; aided by another century from Hodges, and then five wickets by Gill Smith helped England to bowl Australia out for 165. England convincingly won their final two group matches; a four-wicket win over the West Indies, with more than 13 overs remaining, and a 133-run win over the Netherlands.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Helen Plimmer"]}, {"page": "English women's cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1991\u201392", "response": ["* Helen Plimmer (c)", "* Helen Plimmer (c)", "* Helen Plimmer (c)"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Shell Tri-Series", "response": ["* Helen Plimmer (c)"]}, {"page": "English women's cricket team in India in 1995\u201396", "response": ["* Helen Plimmer"]}, {"page": "New Zealand women's cricket team in England and Ireland in 1996", "response": ["* Helen Plimmer"]}]}}
