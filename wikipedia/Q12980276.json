He was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler.\nJennings was a carpenter and joiner by trade who modelled his medium-paced bowling on that of Tom Cartwright and was one of Cartwright's successors as the defensive bowling heart of Somerset's successful one-day cricket side of the late 1970s. He made his first-class and List A debuts in 1975 and the following year was a regular member of Somerset's one-day team. Initially, his batting showed promise, and against the West Indies in 1976 he made 49 of an 82-run eighth wicket partnership with his captain, Brian Close, whose own watchful innings of 88 earned him a recall to the England team at the age of 45. Later that year, his 51 not out took Somerset from a parlous 116 for seven to a three-wicket victory with three balls to spare against Nottinghamshire at Nottingham. But his batting declined markedly and in 1979, when he played in 19 of Somerset's first-class matches, he made only 19 runs all season.But Jennings' principal role was as a tidy, dependable bowler, mainly in one-day cricket. His figures scarcely show many highlights, but his record of being consistently selected alongside stars such as Ian Botham, Joel Garner and Viv Richards indicates a value not measured in wickets. In 1978, he took 40 first-class wickets, the most he achieved in a season, and was awarded his county cap. The bowling included a return of five for 18 in 23.5 overs in the match against Sussex at Hove. That was his only five-wicket haul in senior cricket. Yet with all the stars available he was picked for both the crucial matches at the end of the season when it seemed that Somerset might at last win a trophy: in the event, the county lost both the Gillette Cup final to Sussex and the final John Player League match to Essex and missed out on both trophies.The following season, 1979, Jennings was again a regular and he also played in most of Somerset's first-class matches, though he took only 20 first-class wickets in the season. At the end of the season, Somerset arrived at exactly the same position as in the previous year \u2013 finalists in the Gillette Cup and with a chance of winning the Sunday 40-over competition. This time, both titles were won, though Jennings appeared in only the Gillette Cup final, where he bowled his 12 overs for just 29 runs, the most economical of the Somerset bowlers.In 1980, Somerset lost the services of Garner (and Richards) to the West Indies tour, and new players were introduced to cover the gaps. With a changing side, Jennings lost his regular place in mid-season and did not regain it. Apart from a couple of first-team appearances, he played in 1981 largely for the second eleven and with his contract due for renewal at the end of the season, he chose not to have it renewed, and left county cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jennings", "response": ["*Keith Jennings (American football) (born 1966), American football player", "*Keith Jennings (basketball) (born 1968), American basketball player and coach", "*Keith Jennings (cricketer) (born 1953), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Keith Jennings (1975\u20131981) 68 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Keith Jennings", "response": ["Keith Jennings may refer to:", "*Keith Jennings (footballer) (born 1977), Bermudian international soccer player", "*Keith Jennings (basketball) (born 1968), American basketball coach and former basketball player", "*Keith Jennings (cricketer) (born 1953), English cricketer", "*Keith Jennings (American football) (born 1966), former American football tight end", "*Keith Jennings (tennis), American former tennis player, 1966 U.S. National Championships \u2013 Men's Singles"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset List A cricket records", "response": ["| 8th || 95* || Dennis Breakwell & Keith Jennings || Nottinghamshire || Trent Bridge, Nottingham || 1976"]}, {"page": "1979 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["The Northamptonshire reply was made more difficult when Garner trapped Wayne Larkins leg before wicket and induced Richard Williams to hit his own wicket during his opening bowling spell. Opening batsman Geoff Cook was then joined at the crease by Allan Lamb, and the pair fought back, adding 113 runs in 32 overs before Cook was run out by Roebuck. In his history of Somerset cricket, Roebuck describes this run out as vital, though he does not give himself credit, stating that \"Geoff Cook ran himself out\".Roebuck (1991), p. 357. Marks identified the point at which Lamb was stumped by Derek Taylor as the point at which \"victory was almost assured.\" Jim Yardley and George Sharp added 20 and 22 runs respectively, but with their captain, Watts, unable to bat through injury, and Somerset's West Indian fast bowler Garner in good form, Northamptonshire were bowled out for 224. Garner added four more wickets to the two he had taken during his first spell, to finish with career-best figures of six wickets for 29 runs. Garner, Botham and Keith Jennings all bowled very economically, each restricting their opponents to less than 30 runs from their bowling. Somerset won the match by 45 runs, winning the Gillette Cup, the first trophy they had won during their 104-year history.", "| Keith Jennings || did not bat || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013", "|| Keith Jennings || 12 || 1 || 29 || 0 || 2.42"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1979", "response": ["| Keith Jennings ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm medium || ||  "]}, {"page": "1978 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["Sussex began their run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, surviving a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb shortly before the final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year.Preston 1979, pp. 514\u201315.

The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to play. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset and chose to bat, opening the batting himself alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's Vanburn Holder bowled the first over, which consisted of seven deliveries as it included a no-ball, to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots. The Somerset captain declared the innings closed at the end of the over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no-ball, and Worcestershire only needed two runs to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod opened Worcestershire's batting. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it.
