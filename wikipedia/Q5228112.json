He is the Professor of Scottish History at the University of Glasgow. A specialist in medieval Scottish and Celtic studies, he concentrates primarily on early medieval Scotland, and has written abundantly on the topic of early Scottish king-lists, as well as on literacy, charter-writing, national identity, and on the text known as de Situ Albanie. He is editor of the New Edinburgh History of Scotland series, the pre-1603 editor of the Scottish Historical Review, convener of the Scottish History Society, and the Principal Investigator of the Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded project 'The Paradox of Medieval Scotland, 1093-1286'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malcolm III of Scotland", "response": ["An English invasion in 1054, with Siward, Earl of Northumbria in command, had as its goal the installation of one \"M\u00e1el Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians\". This M\u00e1el Coluim was traditionally identified with the later Malcolm III.See, for instance, Ritchie, Normans, p. 5, or Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 570. Ritchie, p. 5, states that Duncan placed his son, the future Malcolm III of Scotland, in possession of Cumbria as its Prince, and states that Siward invaded Scotland in 1054 to restore him to the Scottish throne. Hector Boece also says this (vol.XII p.249), as does Young, p. 30. The interpretation derives from the Chronicle attributed to  John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury.Broun, \"Identity of the Kingdom\", pp. 133\u201334; Duncan, Kingship, p. 40 The latter reported that Macbeth was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Macbeth outlived Siward by two years.Oram, David I, p. 29 A. A. M. Duncan argued in 2002 that, using the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified \"M\u00e1el Coluim\" with the later Scottish king of the same name.Duncan, Kingship, pp. 37\u201341 Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf.Broun, \"Identity of the Kingdom\", p. 134; Oram, David I, pp. 18\u201320; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 262 It has also been suggested that M\u00e1el Coluim may have been a son of Owain Foel, British king of StrathclydeDuncan, Kingship of the Scots, p. 41 perhaps by a daughter of Malcolm II, King of Scotland.Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 262"]}, {"page": "D\u00e1l Riata", "response": ["* Bannerman, John, \"The Scottish Takeover of Pictland\" in Dauvit Broun & Thomas Owen Clancy (eds.)

One of the Scottish casualties was Carrick's close ally James, Earl of Douglas. Douglas died without an heir, which led to various claims upon the title and estate\u2014Carrick backed Malcolm Drummond, the husband of Douglas's sister, while Fife sided with the successful appellant, Sir Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway who possessed an entail on the Douglas estates.Goodman & Tuck, War and Border Societies, p.\u00a051 Fife, now with his powerful Douglas ally, and those who supported the king ensured a countercoup at the December Council meeting when the guardianship of Scotland passed from Carrick (who had recently been badly injured from a horse-kick) to Fife.Grant in Jones, et al., New Cambridge History p.\u00a0361 Many had also approved of Fife's intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of his younger brother, Buchan. Fife relieved Buchan of his offices of lieutenant of the north and justiciar north of the Forth. The latter role was given to Fife's son, Murdoch Stewart.

The lands in question consisted of the pre-1975 counties of Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, Berwickshire, Peeblesshire and Lanarkshire. David, moreover, gained the title , \"Prince of the Cumbrians\", as attested in David's charters from this era.For all this, see Oram, David, pp. 62\u201364; for Princeps Cumbrensis, see Archibald Lawrie, Early Scottish Charters Prior to A.D. 1153, (Glasgow, 1905), no. 46. Although this was a large slice of Scotland south of the river Forth, the region of Galloway-proper was entirely outside David's control.Richard Oram, The Lordship of Galloway, (Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 54\u201361; see also following references. David may perhaps have had varying degrees of overlordship in parts of Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire.See, for instance, Dauvit Broun, \"The Welsh Identity of the Kingdom of Strathclyde\", in The Innes Review, Vol. 55, no. 2 (Autumn, 2004), pp. 138\u201340, n. 117; see also Forte, Oram, & Pedersen, The Viking Empires, (Cambridge, 2005), pp. 96\u20137. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David eventually set up large-scale marcher lordships, such as Annandale for Robert de Brus, Cunningham for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for Walter Fitzalan.E.g., Oram, David, p. 113, also n. 7.", "One of the first problems David had to deal with as king was an ecclesiastical dispute with the English church. The problem with the English church concerned the subordination of Scottish sees to the archbishops of York and/or Canterbury, an issue which since his election in 1124 had prevented Robert of Scone from being consecrated to the see of St Andrews (Cell R\u00edghmonaidh). It is likely that since the 11th century the bishopric of St Andrews functioned as a de facto archbishopric.

At the time, this island was part of the Pictish kingdom of Fib (Fife). Serf founded the eponymous St Serf's Inch Priory on the island, where he remained seven years. The priory was a community of Augustinian canons. It was founded from St. Andrews Cathedral Priory at the initiation of King David I of Scotland in 1150. From the 15th century onwards the priory began to be referred to as \"Portmoak\". After more than four centuries of Augustinian monastic life, the Protestant king, James VI of Scotland, granted the priory to St Leonard's College, St Andrews.
