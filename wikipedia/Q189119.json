Many of his novels examine class difference and hypocrisy, including A Room with a View (1908), Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924). The last brought him his greatest success. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 16 separate years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthony Hopkins", "response": ["In 1992, Hopkins starred in Merchant-Ivory's period film based on the E. M. Forster novel Howards End. Hopkins acted alongside Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter where he played the cold businessman Henry Wilcox. The film received enormous critical acclaim, with critic Leonard Maltin calling it \"extraordinarily good on every level.\" The following year, Hopkins reunited with Merchant-Ivory and Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day (1993), a film set in 1950s post-war Britain based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro. The film was ranked by the British Film Institute as one of the 64th greatest British film of the 20th century.British Film Institute \u2013 Top 100 British Films (1999).

M. Forster, such as A Room with a View (1986). But further attempts to make 'big' productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after Revolution (1985) and Absolute Beginners (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, Roland Joff\u00e9's The Mission (also 1986), won the 1986 Palme d'Or, but did not go into profit either. Joff\u00e9's earlier The Killing Fields (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joff\u00e9's first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam."]}, {"page": "George Orwell", "response": ["In August 1941, Orwell finally obtained \"war work\" when he was taken on full-time by the BBC's Eastern Service. When interviewed for the job he indicated that he \"accept[ed] absolutely the need for propaganda to be directed by the government\" and stressed his view that, in wartime, discipline in the execution of government policy was essential. He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine imperial links. This was Orwell's first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, E. M. Forster, Ahmed Ali, Mulk Raj Anand, and William Empson among others."]}, {"page": "Gerolamo Cardano", "response": ["English novelist E. M. Forster's Abinger Harvest, a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled 'The Past'.

Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as E. M. Forster, Leonard Woolf, David Garnett and Storm Jameson all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism.Ian Patterson, \"Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors\", in Adam Piette and Mark Rawlinson, The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century British and American War Literature, Edinburgh University Press 2012.

Scott's critical reputation declined in the last half of the 19th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism, and Scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children. This trend accelerated in the 20th century. For example, in his classic study  Aspects of the Novel (1927), E. M. Forster harshly criticized Scott's clumsy and slapdash writing style, \"flat\" characters, and thin plots. In contrast, the novels of Scott's contemporary Jane Austen, once appreciated only by the discerning few (including, as it happened, Scott himself) rose steadily in critical esteem, though Austen, as a female writer, was still faulted for her narrow (\"feminine\") choice of subject matter, which, unlike Scott, avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine."]}, {"page": "Thomas Pynchon", "response": ["Pynchon's work also has similarities with writers in the modernist tradition who wrote long novels dealing with large metaphysical or political issues, such as Ulysses by James Joyce, A Passage to India by E. M. Forster, The Apes of God by Wyndham Lewis, The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil and the U.S.A. trilogy by John Dos Passos. Pynchon explicitly acknowledges his debt to Beat Generation writers, and expresses his admiration for Jack Kerouac's On the Road in particular. He also outlines the specific influence on his own early fiction of literary works by T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, Saul Bellow, Herbert Gold, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, John Buchan and Graham Greene, and non-fiction works by Helen Waddell, Norbert Wiener and Isaac Asimov."]}, {"page": "Lord of the Flies", "response": ["A turning point occurred when E. M. Forster chose Lord of the Flies as his \"outstanding novel of the year.\" Other reviews described it as \"not only a first-rate adventure but a parable of our times\". In February 1960, Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction rated Lord of the Flies five stars out of five, stating that \"Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society ...
