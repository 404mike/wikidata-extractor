He was born at Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent and died at Croxton, Staffordshire.\nEducated at King's School, Canterbury and Christ's College, Cambridge, Glennie made little impact in his solitary first-class cricket match, which came against a team of Kent amateurs: he scored one run in his two innings and failed to take a wicket. There are no records of him appearing in any other cricket matches, first-class or non-first-class.Glennie was ordained as a Church of England clergyman after leaving Cambridge, and was a church inspector of schools for some years, later recording his experiences in a book. From 1869 to his death in 1903 he was the vicar of Croxton, Staffordshire. His son, Reginald, was also a first-class cricketer and clergyman.", "link_mentions": {}}}
