Karl Popper characterized it as pseudoscience based on psychoanalysis failing the requirement for falsifiability. Frank Cioffi argued that \"though Popper is correct to say that psychoanalysis is pseudoscientific and correct to say that it is unfalsifiable, he is mistaken to suggest that it is pseudoscientific because it is unfalsifiable.

Webster argues that while the book contains much pertinent criticism of Freud, it has been overvalued by critics of psychoanalysis because of its overly theoretical and abstract style of argument, and has also distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. Webster compared the former psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's The Assault on Truth (1984) to E. M. Thornton's The Freudian Fallacy (1983), finding both authors hostile towards Freud and psychoanalysis. However, he suggested that Masson nevertheless retained a partly positive view of Freud. Webster credited Masson with making some contributions to the history of psychoanalysis, but wrote that his central argument has not convinced either the psychoanalytic establishment or the majority of Freud's critics, as Masson accepted that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients, an account disputed by scholars such as Cioffi, Thornton, Han Isra\u00ebls, and Morton Schatzman, who have argued that Freud's original account of his therapeutic methods suggests that this is not what occurred. According to Webster, Freud's seduction theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of his therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. Webster blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that orthodox psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of incest was required. Webster describes the critic Frederick Crews's The Memory Wars (1995) as one of the most significant contributions to the debate on recovered memory therapy. Webster writes that the psychologist Hans Eysenck's Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) contains many cogent criticisms of Freud, but criticizes Eysenck for uncritically accepting Elizabeth Thornton's argument that Joseph Breuer's patient Anna O. suffered from tuberculous meningitis. Webster writes that some of Thomas Szasz's arguments in The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) are similar to his, but that he disagrees with his view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that Jean-Martin Charcot's patients were not genuinely mentally ill. Webster concludes that no \"negative critique\" of psychoanalysis \"can ever constitute an adequate refutation\" of Freud's theories, because \"bad theories can only be driven out by better theories.\""]}, {"page": "The Assault on Truth", "response": ["The Assault on Truth received negative reviews from the historian Peter Gay in The Philadelphia Inquirer, the psychoanalyst Anthony Storr in The New York Times Book Review, Stephen A.

Popper, responding to a description of Gr\u00fcnbaum's arguments provided to him by the journalist Daniel Goleman, denied that psychoanalysis can provide testable predictions. His comments were published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The journal's editor questioned whether it is worthwhile to attempt to test Freud's claims, comparing it to attempting to test astrology or creationism. The psychologist Malcolm Macmillan argued that Gr\u00fcnbaum's critique of free association is insufficiently convincing. Crews criticized Gr\u00fcnbaum for focusing on Freud's clinical theory while neglecting Freud's metapsychology, and for accepting Freud's claims to \"methodological sophistication.\" The author Richard Webster argued that The Foundations of Psychoanalysis has been overvalued because of its abstract style of argument and has distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. The author Allen Esterson argued both that the \"Tally Argument\" is defective and also that it was not invoked by Freud. The philosopher Frank Cioffi criticized Gr\u00fcnbaum's treatment of Popper. The literature scholar Robert Wilcocks considered Gr\u00fcnbaum in some ways too favorable to Freud. He criticized Gr\u00fcnbaum for giving insufficient attention to Freud's use of cocaine and his treatment of Emma Eckstein. The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani argued that Gr\u00fcnbaum's position that Freud was a \"sophisticated scientific methodologist\" who attempted to deal with the possible effects of suggestion on his patients through the \"Tally Argument\" is unjustified, since the argument presupposes, but does not prove, non-suggestibility.
