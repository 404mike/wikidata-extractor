When he became vicar, Prichard was a habitual drunkard, but underwent a conversion experience while there.Prichard, who was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, composed many poems on religious themes.  His greatest fame lies with his influential poem Cannwyll y Cymry (usually translated as The Welshman's Candle), a collection of poetical teachings and moral guidance.\nLater in his life Prichard built a larger house on the same plot of land where his birthplace had originally stood, and this house was demolished in the mid-20th century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
