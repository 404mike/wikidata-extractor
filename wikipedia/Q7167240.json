(1875\u20131965)", "response": ["Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons in all, but most of them were spent in the bottom half of the table. Consistency of selection played a part in the 1920s; six\u00a0\u2013 Womack, Bradford, Crosbie, Dan Tremelling, Percy Barton and Liddell\u00a0\u2013 of the  fifteen men with more than 300 league appearances for the club played most of their matches in that decade.Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 471\u201372. Much reliance was placed on Tremelling and then on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 15\u201317. Under Liddell's management, the makeup of the side never settled. He used 70 players over his six seasons in charge (in contrast to the 55 used in the first six First Division seasons in the 1920sMatthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 284\u201395.), and after narrowly avoiding relegation three times in 1934, 1935 and 1938, Birmingham were finally relegated in 1938\u201339, the last full season before the Second World War.

He was a competitive, \"hard-man\" type of half-back, similar to his teammate Percy Barton. After leaving Birmingham he played for Swansea Town and Clapton Orient and then returned to Sheffield. He died in 1952, aged about 60."]}, {"page": "Dickie Dale (footballer)", "response": ["Dale played for Stanley United, North Walbottle and West Hartlepool before joining Football League First Division club Birmingham on trial in March 1922. The trial proved successful, he made his Football League debut on 6 September 1922 in a goalless draw away to Newcastle United, and, according to the Athletic News in March 1924, he \"gave such a sound and, indeed, striking display, even at left half-back, that he has been considered a regular member of the side ever since.\" He kept his place for two more matches before the England international Percy Barton returned from injury. A few weeks later, after more injuries left a vacancy at right half, Dale \"demonstrated his versatility by at once falling into the position\", and held it until mid-March 1923 when Jimmy Daws came back into the team. He made 34 League appearances in the 1923\u201324 season, mainly at right half but also covering at centre half."]}, {"page": "Tom Evans (footballer, born 1896)", "response": ["Evans was born in Dudley, which is now in the West Midlands county. He played local football before joining Birmingham during the First World War. When the Football League resumed, Evans made his debut in the Second Division on 27 September 1919, standing in for Joe Roulson at right half in a home game against Huddersfield Town which Birmingham won 4\u20132. He played five more games during the 1919\u201320 season, in each case taking Roulson's place at right half either in his absence or while he switched to the left to replace Percy Barton.Matthews, p. 162. Unable to establish himself as a first-team player, Evans spent the 1921\u201322 season in the Third Division South with Brighton & Hove Albion, but played only five matches when regular right half Jack Woodhouse was unavailable through injury. He then returned to the Black Country where he played for several years in the Birmingham & District League for Cradley Heath."]}, {"page": "Vincent White (footballer)", "response": ["He had played football for his battalion team during the war, and once demobilised, played amateur football for Erdington before turning professional, first with Wednesbury Old Athletic and then in 1921 with Birmingham. A defensive wing half whose strength was his tackling, White made his debut in the First Division on 8 April 1922, deputising for Percy Barton in a 2\u20131 defeat away at Tottenham Hotspur, and played in the next game, but lost his place once Barton was available for selection again.Matthews, p. 164. Despite having played League football, he was selected for and played in a junior international between the Birmingham Association and the Scottish Junior XI at Aberdeen on 22 April. He spent time at non-league clubs Ellesmere Port and Redditch Town before joining Watford, for whom he played seven Third Division South matches in the first of two seasons with the club."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-five players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were eleven different goalscorers.
