In came full back Tom Adamson, half backs Reginald Davies (the new captain), Harry Salt and forwards Cecil Blakemore, Jackie Foster, Billy Lane and John Payne. Brentford went on to have their best season at that time in the Football League, ending 1929 in second place and ascending to the top of the Third Division South on 25 January 1930. The good results were due to a consistently fit starting XI, which went unchanged for 21 consecutive matches in all competitions between 2 November 1929 and 15 March 1930, a club record. Top spot was held onto until a 0\u20130 draw with Exeter City on 29 March saw Plymouth Argyle overtake the Bees and automatic promotion was effectively conceded after successive defeats in mid-April. Brentford finished as runners-up and would remain in the Third Division South for 1930\u201331.

(1889\u20131954)", "response": ["It was all change at Griffin Park during the 1926 off-season, with former Gillingham boss Harry Curtis being installed as manager. Just 9 members of the previous season's squad were retained, but despite mid-table finishes over the following three seasons, Curtis slowly rebuilt the squad with successful full back acquisitions William Hodge, Alexander Stevenson, half backs Jimmy Bain, Reginald Davies and forwards Bill Berry and Jack Phillips. The 1929\u201330 Third Division South season provided the foundation for the Bees' future success, with the club's unbeaten home record of 21 wins setting a national record which still stands today. Important future signings were made, including outside right Jackie Foster, centre forward Billy Lane, left back Tom Adamson and a masterstroke, local non-league centre half Joe James, who would go on to become one of the club's greatest midfielders. Though Brentford won a club-record 28 league matches, failure to mirror that form away from Griffin Park denied the club promotion to the Second Division after finishing as runners-up to Plymouth Argyle. Third and fifth-place finishes followed in the 1930\u201331 and 1931\u201332 seasons respectively, despite the sales of key forwards Jack Lane and Billy Lane, but a sound investment was made in inside forward George Robson, and the acquisition of England amateur international left half Jackie Burns proved to be a coup."]}]}}
