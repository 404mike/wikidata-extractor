He also played Merlin in the BBC television series The Legend of King Arthur, and the tragic ferryman in The Storyteller episode \"The Luck Child\".\nEddison was an award-winning actor, known for his mellifluously resonant, baritone voice and long, lean 6' 3\" figure. Throughout his 60-year career he was constantly in demand as an actor and worked with many of Britain's greatest stage actors, often during the early formative years of their careers including Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi and Maggie Smith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 14", "response": ["*1991 \u2013 Robert Eddison, Japanese-English actor  (b. 1908)"]}, {"page": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", "response": ["Additionally, Michael Byrne portrays Ernst Vogel, a brutal SS colonel.

Malikyan had impressed Spielberg with his performance in Midnight Express (1978) and would have auditioned for the role of Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark had a traffic jam not delayed his meeting with the director. Robert Eddison appears as the Grail Knight, the guardian of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal as long as he stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing in a few films since the 1930s (including a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his return to film, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released."]}, {"page": "1989 in film", "response": ["| Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade || Paramount Pictures / Lucasfilm || Steven Spielberg (director); Jeffrey Boam (screenplay); Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Denholm Elliott, Alison Doody, John Rhys-Davies, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, Michael Byrne, Kevork Malikyan, Robert Eddison, Richard Young, Alexei Sayle, Alex Hyde-White, Paul Maxwell, Isla Blair, Vernon Dobtcheff, Bradley Gregg, Frederick Jaeger, Eugene Lipinski || Action, Adventure || Live action"]}, {"page": "The StoryTeller (TV series)", "response": ["This episode stars Steven Mackintosh as the Luck Child, Philip Jackson as the King, Cathryn Bradshaw as the Princess, Pauline Moran as the Queen, Anthony O'Donnell as the Little Man, Robert Eddison as the Cursed Ferryman, and George Little as the voice of the Griffin (which is operated by Alistair Fullarton and Brian Henson)."]}, {"page": "Present Laughter", "response": ["The play has been regularly revived.
