Although it was rumoured at the time that all copies of Horizon, the literary magazine in which it was published, were seized by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Kavanagh denied that this had occurred, saying later that he was visited by two Garda\u00ed at his home (probably in connection with an investigation of Horizon under the Special Powers Act). Written from the viewpoint of a single peasant against the historical background of famine and emotional despair, the poem is often held by critics to be Kavanagh's finest work. It set out to counter the saccharine romanticising of the Irish literary establishment in its view of peasant life. Richard Murphy in The New York Times Book Review described it as \"a great work\" and Robin Skelton in Poetry praised it as \"a vision of mythic intensity\"."]}, {"page": "Penguin Modern Poets", "response": ["#Richard Murphy, Jon Silkin, Nathaniel Tarn"]}, {"page": "George Sutherland Fraser", "response": ["A.
