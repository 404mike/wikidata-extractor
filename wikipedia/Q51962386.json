He was murdered in 1901 by a relative who nursed a grudge against him.\nThe Survey of London dubs him \"the big-scale yet shadowy South London developer-builder\". Bailey specifies that the source of capital for his entr\u00e9e into large-scale estate development is unclear. Sources provide conflicting information on a number of aspects of his life and work; notably the number of houses developed under his direction; his place of birth; and the value of his estate.", "link_mentions": {}}}
