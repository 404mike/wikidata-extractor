He was murdered in 1901 by a relative who nursed a grudge against him.\nThe Survey of London dubs him \"the big-scale yet shadowy South London developer-builder\". Bailey specifies that the source of capital for his entr\u00e9e into large-scale estate development is unclear. Sources provide conflicting information on a number of aspects of his life and work; notably the number of houses developed under his direction; his place of birth; and the value of his estate.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901", "response": ["** Alfred Heaver, English property developer (b. 1841)"]}, {"page": "1841", "response": ["* February 10 \u2013 Alfred Heaver, English property developer (d. 1901)"]}, {"page": "Balham", "response": ["Balham is overwhelmingly in Wandsworth, with only small parts in the neighbouring Borough of Lambeth and encompasses the A24 north of Tooting Bec and the roads radiating off it.

The southern part of Balham, towards Tooting Bec, near the 1930s block of Art Deco flats called Du Cane Court and the area to the south of Wandsworth Common, comes under the SW17 postcode.

In the 1870s and 1880s the area around The Falcon was developed into the terraced-house streetscape which remains to current times. Alfred Heaver, one of the key property developers, with the assistance of the Wandsworth District Board of Works, established St Johns Road as a straight wide road from what had been little more than a farm-track. The Falcon now found itself occupying a key location at the crossroads of St Johns Road and St Johns Hill as both were developed into streets of shops. The then landlord, John Tavener, entered into what appears to have been a land-for-reconstruction swap with another developer, George Nathaniel Street, so that The Falcon was in 1882-3 relocated to the curved crossroads corner of its site and rebuilt in its current form by builders R. & H. Pickersgill.

The front elevation of the building has five main bays, the second and fourth of which project slightly and are topped by shaped gables. A sixth bay in the form of an octagonal tourelle with a steep roof forms the right-side corner of the building. This feature was added to Mountford's winning design after its submission and before building commenced; originally projected as a two-story turret, it was built to three-stories height. One effect of the turret is to set the library's entrance off-centre. The building is minimally embellished, having only carved-brick garlands and putti above the ground-floor windows of the projecting bays, probably by Gilbert Seale of Camberwell; and decoration around the arched entrance with a frieze above. Andrew Saint, in Survey of London, Battersea, describes the building as being in the \"mildly Flemish Renaissance style, in the spirit of Ernest George\"."]}, {"page": "Module talk:Mapframe/Archive 1", "response": ["There's an OSM feature - https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/96977452 - which has a wikidata QId of Q63322683.
