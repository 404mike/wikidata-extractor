After sealing five signings within a month of the end of the 2010\u201311 season, the club stated that the playing staff was \"shaping up more for how we would like it\" Additionally, the club tied down five of its academy squad to professional deals on 8 July 2010, with goalkeeper James Severn, defender Kallum Keane, midfielders Jeff Hendrick and Graham Kelly and attacker Ryan Connolly all signing deals to become part of Nigel Clough's first team squad. Kelly was sent out on loan to League of Ireland Premier Division side Bray Wanderers the next day. The club also took on several trialists with Ilkeston Town's Amari Morgan-Smith, American Conor Doyle, Woking striker Joel Ledgister and Australian duo Marc Hatvani and Courtney Chipperfield taking part in the club's pre-season fixtures. Doyle impressed sufficiently enough for the club to sign him on a two-year deal which he signed ahead of the opening day of the season. Despite the addition of Doyle, there was a continued hunt for a new forward. The club where heavily linked with Scunthorpe United's Gary Hooper, who Clough highlighted as a player he admired, though Scunthorpe's fee proved too prohibitive for the club and he eventually joined Celtic for \u00a32.4m, with Clough saying the move was not \"right for (Derby) at this stage\". Other players to attract attention were West Bromwich Albion's Simon Cox, Everton's James Vaughan, Wigan Athletic's Jason Scotland and Sheffield United's Billy Sharp, though Sharp eventually joined Doncaster Rovers.", "In terms of departures, two players left for transfer fees. Contract-rebel Kris Commons joined Celtic for a fee of around \u00a3300k, turning down a \u00a3500k overture from Celtic's Old Firm rivals who failed to match his wage demands. Left back Dean Moxey was the subject of a \u00a3400,000 bid from Crystal Palace, which was accepted by Derby. Clough stated the bid's acceptance was football, rather than financially related, explaining \"He (Moxey) has not really progressed this season as much as we hoped. We just thought it was a good offer. We have got another good left back in Gareth Roberts and we can always get cover in on loan if we need it.\" Other departures saw Medi Abalimba, whose contract at Derby was terminated but the club held onto his registration, join Oldham Athletic on a free and the young trio of Graham Kelly, Mitchell Hanson and Kallum Keane had their contracts canceled five months early by mutual consent. Temporary departures saw Ross Atkins extend his stay at Tamworth and Greg Mills rejoin Telford on season long deals.

Prior to the game, Clough also spoke of his desire for patience and his commitment to bringing through youth at Derby. Reflecting on Clough's comments, the Derby Evening Telegraph stated \"The conveyor belt at Derby has juddered and stalled at times and in many ways it has been rusted by constant changes within the Academy set up\" before highlighting past academy-graduates England international Tom Huddlestone, Northern Ireland international Lee Camp, Wales international Lewin Nyatanga and England U21 internationals Lee Grant, Giles Barnes and Lee Holmes (all of whom were no longer with the club) as examples that the current youth set-up should aim to emulate. As if to prove that Derby's youth production was back on track, academy graduate Mark O'Brien, who had played in every game of the new season despite being just 18 years old, signed a new four-year contract, extending his stay at the club until the summer of 2015. On the same day, winger Dave Martin joined Walsall on a months loan and the following week Stephen Bywater moved to Sheffield Wednesday until the end of the year with goalkeeping coach Martin Taylor saying of Bywater \"He's not in the squad at all. Nothing against Stephen because he's worked really hard but he doesn't figure in our plans. At his age he just needs to play games and get in the shop window.\" There was also a link with Mansfield Town's Tom Naylor, who played for the reserves in a bid to earn a contract offer from the club, and Clough laughed off West Bromwich Albion's rumoured \u00a33m interest in John Brayford, saying \"Is that all, \u00a33million?\"", "With the opening of the transfer window, Derby made permanent Tom Naylor's loan move from Mansfield Town on a three-year deal, and signed Sunderland striker Ryan Noble on a month's loan for a second time; Noble having also had a loan spell at the club in the previous campaign.

Due to trouble in previous seasons, a hugely unpopular 'anti-hooligan operation' was introduced by West Yorkshire Police in 2010 for Millwall fans to exchange vouchers for tickets at Woolley Edge service station on the M1 motorway near Wakefield. The restriction severely affected the atmosphere in the ground; limiting the number of supporters attending away games at Elland Road, from the capacity of 3,000 visiting fans down to just 150. The Whites were top of the table for most of the first half of the 2009\u201310 season, and only lost once in their first 24 games. That defeat was a 2\u20131 loss at the Den, with goals from Neil Harris and Gary Alexander. In March 2010, Millwall completed their second League double over Leeds, with Steve Morison and Shaun Batt securing a 2\u20130 win at Elland Road. It was their first away win in the fixture in 22 years. At the end of the season Leeds finished second in League One on 86 points and were promoted automatically. Millwall finished third on 85 points and were promoted via the play-offs, with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town in the 2010 League One play-off Final."]}]}}
