A year later, she picked up a set of Northumbrian smallpipes brought home by her father, who intended them for someone else.

He also bought a good mouth organ at this time, intending it to be for his son, but liked it so much he kept it himself. He also refined his mouth organ technique after hearing Larry Adler's playing, and mostly played mouth organ subsequently. In 1974 he was one of the artists recorded by Topic, playing mouth organ, on Bonny North Tyne - Northumbrian Country Music. In later life, he recorded many times, chiefly with producer Geoff Heslop. The first release, with his friends Joe Hutton (piper) and Willy Taylor, collectively known as The Shepherds, was Harthope Burn, next came a compilation of Northumbrian Music and Poetry, From Sewingshields to Glendale (with Kathryn Tickell, Alistair Anderson, Mike Tickell, Hutton and Atkinson, etc.) and in 1989 Heslop and Alistair Anderson recorded him in a solo album called simply Will Atkinson - Mouthorgan. This included tunes from various sources, including five of his own compositions. Several recordings of him playing at folk clubs are available on the FARNE archive.

From the playing of these and other pupils, it is clear that Armstrong must have been not only a fine piper but an excellent teacher.
