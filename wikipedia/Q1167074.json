It was Slaney who introduced Austerberry to football, inviting him to watch Stoke play and write reports on the game as a journalist. He took over from Bill Rowley as Stoke manager in 1897, allowing Rowley to become his secretary. His first season in charge was a poor and controversial one as Stoke finished bottom of the First Division and had to play in the end of season test matches. They had to play the top two sides from the Second Division, Burnley and Newcastle United. Stoke came through successfully, beating each side once and drawing with Burnley to stay up. In the final test match Stoke and Burnley needed a draw to be in the First Division next season. It finished 0\u20130 after a farcical 90 minutes during which neither side put in a challenge or had a shot at goal and at one point a few fans in the crowd held on to the ball and refused to return it to the players. After this obvious exploit of the rules the league scrapped the test match system in favour of automatic promotion and relegation. His secretary, Rowley then caused controversy as he arranged his own transfer to Leicester Fosse which included a signing on fee, he was consequently banned from football by the FA."]}, {"page": "Slaney", "response": ["* Thomas Slaney (1852\u20131935), English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Walter Cox (footballer, born 1849)", "response": ["Cox was another ex-Stoke player who stepped into the manager's seat vacated by Thomas Slaney in 1883.
