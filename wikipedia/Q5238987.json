Pre-Second World War Wagnerian tenors such as Jacques Urlus, Heinrich Knote, Alexander Kirchner, Lauritz Melchior and Franz V\u00f6lker also undertook the part (usually singing it in German). The Russian heroic tenor Ivan Yershov was a renowned pre-World War I Otello in his native country. His compatriot Arnold Azrikan achieved his greatest recognition as a dramatic tenor in Otello.

It was released in 1978.", "The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in May 1978. Comparing it with rival recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan and Karl B\u00f6hm, he acknowledged that these classic readings offered singing of a \"subtlety and poise\" that Alain Lombard's version could not equal. On the other hand, the new album's students at Don Alfonso's school for lovers came to their classroom with \"youthful timbre[s] and natural high spirits\" that were nicely appropriate to their roles. As Fiordiligi, Kiri Te Kanawa was \"magnificent\", singing \"in her best, creamiest voice\". Aristocratic in \"Come scoglio\" and meditatively introspective in \"Per piet\u00e0\", she infused her role with tenderness and feminity. Her only fault was that she sometimes sang slightly flat. Frederica von Stade's Dorabella was \"hardly less distinguished, with ample, broad phrasing, much well shaped detail in 'Smanie implacibili' and a graceful and spirited account of 'E' amore un ladroncello'.\" David Rendall, although sharing Te Kanawa's tendency to sing below the note, offered a Ferrando with the requisite honey for \"Un' aura amorosa\" and the requisite fire for \"Tradito, schernito\". Philippe Huttenlocher gave a \"very polished performance\" as Guglielmo, acting the part convincingly, using his words intelligently and bringing a laudable legato to \"Non siate ritrosi\". Jules Bastin's Alfonso was sung forcefully but without much expressiveness, a charge that could not be levelled at Teresa Stratas. Her Despina was vivid and extremely musical, but it was \"a pity that she felt the need to squeak and squawk so grotesquely in her impersonations of a doctor and a notary\". The chief failings of the album, though, had nothing to do with any of its soloists. The orchestral playing suffered from \"a lack of finesse\", and the conducting from a dearth of dramatic conviction and \"a general lack of sparkle\". Sadie did not take exception to Lombard's bias towards slow tempi, but he was disappointed that the album evinced no care over appoggiaturas. (A further instance of negligence was the clipping of bar 49 of \"Come scoglio\" by a clumsy editor.) Overall, the album was a good one, but not good enough to compete with the best of its many illustrious predecessors,Gramophone, May 1978, pp. 1929-1930", "J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1978. He was sad that it was one of those opera recordings in which excellence was betrayed by the mediocrity surrounding it. The excellence in question was provided by the two ladies from Ferrara. Kiri Te Kanawa sang Fiordiligi with an acute sensitivity to her music's meaning, her voice \"at its most beautiful, warm and well-rounded\". As Dorabella, Frederica von Stade was Te Kanawa's perfect foil, her timbre complementing the soprano's so well that their voices blended in their duets in a way that could hardly be bettered.  But Teresa Stratas, although a vivid Despina, sang with a tone that gave little pleasure. As Guglielmo, Philippe Huttenlocher was \"inelegant\". As Ferrando, David Rendall sang with a piano tone that lacked focus and a forte that sounded muffled. And worst of all, Alain Lombard seemed unable to distinguish between passages where a slow tempo was heavenly and others where it was laughable. \"Instead of placing the partnership of Te Kanawa and von Stade in the place where it belongs, classic in freshness, beauty and character\", the album's flaws had in Steane's view consigned it to the margins of the Cos\u00ec fan tutte discography. \"You do not wear a diamond in a leaden ring.\"Gramophone, July 1978, p. 167", "George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in August 1978. Like Sadie and Steane, he singled out Kiri Te Kanawa for especial praise, lauding her \"abundant musicality and tone of creamy richness throughout most of the range\". However, he thought that the cruel vocal assault course that Mozart had created for Fiordiligi had been difficult for her to negotiate. Frederica von Stade sang just as beautifully, and it was not her fault if her timbre was too like Te Kanawa's to allow an ideal degree of contrast between them. Teresa Stratas was an older Despina than some, and she took the comedy of her notary too far, but the gaiety of her approach was mostly enjoyable. The album's gentlemen were not quite as impressive as its ladies. As Ferrando, David Rendall had an \"agreeable and malleable light tenor\" but his technique sometimes left something to be desired. Philippe Huttenlocher was a solid but bland Guglielmo. Jules Bastin sang stylishly, but without either the force or the comfortable upper notes that an Alfonso needed. Recitatives were hampered by some pedestrian harpsichord continuo work. The orchestra, if not the most sumptuous of ensembles, played with warmth and accuracy and was blessed with some first-rate woodwinds. Alain Lombard's conducting was animated and accommodating, although it was marred by an unfortunate bias towards slow tempi. The album's audio quality, if \"not particularly spacious\", was perfectly acceptable. All things considered, though, Lombard's Cos\u00ec fan tutte could not really compete with alternative recordings conducted by Karl B\u00f6hm, Erich Leinsdorf or Georg Solti.", "* David Rendall (tenor), Ferrando, an army officer, in love with Dorabella"]}, {"page": "The Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala", "response": ["* 9 (10:11) \"Pria di dividerci de voi, signore\", with Edda Moser (Elvira), Diane Kesling (Zulma), David Rendall (Lindoro), Gail Dubinbaum (Isabella), Ara Berberian (Mustaf\u00e0), John Darrenkamp (Haly), Sesto Bruscantini (Taddeo) and members of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus, conducted by James Levine", "* David Rendall (b. 1948), tenor"]}]}}
