Their granddaughter Editha Aceituna Thurlow Griffin was a mystery and historical romance writer.In 1865 Thomas Allom was commissioned to design a mausoleum for George Dodd at West Norwood Cemetery. The mausoleum is in the form of a small Gothic chapel with coloured marble, suggesting a north Italian inspiration for the design, and is now a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that Dodd had bought sixteen houses designed by Thomas Allom in Kensington Park Gardens and wanted his mausoleum to be designed by the same architect.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Dodd (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Dodd (politician)"]}, {"page": "Editha Aceituna Thurlow Griffin", "response": ["Editha Aceituna Thurlow was born in Gibraltar, the daughter of British parents, Edward Hovell Thurlow and Georgina Violet Dodd Thurlow.
