By August the following year, he was promoted lieutenant, and in September he was transferred to the 14th Regiment of the Militia. It was this regiment which accompanied him in battle at Waterloo. Soon after, however, when he was placed on half-pay, Moore decided to accompany his brother in law, John Wylde, who had recently been appointed Judge advocate of New South Wales, to Sydney,\nThey arrived on 5 October 1816, on a ship called the Elizabeth, with Wylde making his official landing in the Governor's barge under a salute of thirteen guns on October 12. Moore was thereby appointed Registrar of the Governor's Court and a clerk to Wylde, at a salary of \u00a380. In 1824 the Supreme Court of New South Wales was formally established, and Moore spent some time acting as a prothonotary, until the following year, when his post was abolished. Among other later occupations, Moore became a pastoralist, and a great owner of land.\nMoore died on 27 July 1864, at Baw Baw.", "link_mentions": {}}}
