The Jack polynomials are named after him. His research dealt with the development of analytic methods to evaluate certain integrals over matrix spaces. His most famous paper relates his integrals to classes of symmetric polynomials important in the theory of the representation of the symmetric group. He discovered a new, natural basis for the symmetric polynomials.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of special functions and eponyms", "response": ["*Henry Jack (1917\u20131978) Dundee: Jack polynomial"]}, {"page": "Menzieshill", "response": ["*Henry Jack FRSE (1917-1978) mathematician"]}, {"page": "Jack function", "response": ["In mathematics, the Jack function  is a generalization of the Jack polynomial, introduced by Henry Jack.
