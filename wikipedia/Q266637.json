Publishers of prints and illustrations for expensive books, both important British markets at the time, also adopted the technique.  In all these areas, a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model, with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint.Griffiths, 94 After the French Revolution, one of the most successful publishers in London, the German Rudolf Ackermann, had numbers of French refugees working on the floor above his shop in The Strand in London, each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table.Mayor, 374\u2013376", "File:The Iron Forge between Dolgelli and Barmouth in Merioneth Shire, Plate 6 of XII Views in North Wales MET DP104271.jpg|Paul Sandby, The Iron Forge between Dolgelli and Barmouth in Merioneth Shire, Plate 6 of XII Views in North Wales, 1776, etching and aquatint printed in brown.", "File:View near Edwinsford, Carnarvonshire sic.jpeg|Paul Sandby, View near Edwinsford, Carnarvonshire, 1812, with colours added by hand."]}, {"page": "Watercolor painting", "response": ["The three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are Paul Sandby (1730\u20131809), often called the \"father of the English watercolor\"; Thomas Girtin (1775\u20131802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775\u20131851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings.
