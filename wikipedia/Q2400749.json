Woodburn and Nolan had an onscreen history of a sour relationship due to comments and claims made from both parties in the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2017. Woodburn had been invited to come on the show to reconcile with Nolan, but later claimed her attendance was due to the money offered. The row led to over 8,000 complaints to Ofcom, with the majority accusing Nolan and her fellow panellists of 'bullying Woodburn'. Some of Woodburn\u2019s supporters even set up a campaign to have Nolan removed from the Loose Women panel completely. She apologised on This Morning in September 2018 and confirmed that she had taken a break from Loose Women and that she had also postponed her 'Never Too Late' solo concert tour.
