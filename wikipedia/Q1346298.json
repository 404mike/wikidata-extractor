He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry City from 1918 to 1922 and a Member of the Northern Ireland Parliament (MP) for Londonderry from 1921 to 1925.A key figure of the Gaelic revival, MacNeill was a co-founder of the Gaelic League, to preserve Irish language and culture. He has been described as \"the father of the modern study of early Irish medieval history\".He established the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and served as its Chief-of-Staff of the remaining minority after its split in 1914 at the start of the World War. He held the position at the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916 but had no role in the Rising or its planning, which was carried out by infiltrators from the Irish Republican Brotherhood. MacNeill helped countermand the uprising on Easter Sunday after learning about it and confronting Patrick Pearse, by placing a last-minute news advertisement advising Volunteers not to take part. In 1918 he was elected to the First D\u00e1il as a member of Sinn F\u00e9in.", "link_mentions": {}}}
