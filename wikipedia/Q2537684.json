In the original version tennis rackets were used and the wicket consisted of six stumps. On 17 October 1902, a match was played before the MCC committee at Lord's. An eleven led by real tennis and rackets player Eustace Miles, and including Wimbledon champions Laurence and Reginald Doherty, defeated the opposition, led by Surrey batsman Bobby Abel. Miles' team led after the first innings by 73 to 18 runs and won by an innings after Abel's team made only 39 runs in the second innings. That same month the game was also played at Crystal Palace. Games were also played that year, and in 1903, at London's Queen's Club. In England interest in the game died down after a few years but it managed to gain a foothold in Australia where it was introduced during World War I. A key figure in the promotion of the game in Australia was Ettie Dodge, who was President (1919\u201366) of the New South Wales Women's Vigoro Association and foundation president (1932\u201366) of the All Australian [Vigoro] Association. Ettie's husband had met John George Grant in England. When the game was introduced to New South Wales schools in the 1920s, Dodge & Co. began selling vigoro equipment. Grant died in 1927 and bequeathed the trademark and copyright of the game to Ettie.\"Ettie Dodge (1885 - 1973)\" by Anne-Marie Gaudry, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, 1996, retrieved (from online edition) 20 December 2006"]}, {"page": "Sir William Miles, 1st Baronet", "response": ["*Captain William Henry Miles, JP (1830\u20131888), who married Mary Frances Kynaston Charlton, daughter of Rev John Kynaston Charleton; they had a son, Eustace Miles, and two daughters."]}, {"page": "List of vegetarians", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" |Eustace Miles"]}, {"page": "Eustace H.

Several vegetarian athletes adopted Haig's diet with success. Karl Mann, a German vegetarian walker switched to Haig's diet in 1898 and won an international Dresden-Berlin race in 1902. Haig personally met Mann and examined him after the race. Haig criticized the standard vegetarian diet based on grains and legumes for being low in protein and dissociated his diet from it. In 1908, he commented that \"vegetarianism has been a great thorn in my side in advocating, as I do, a physiological and purin-free diet.\""]}]}}
