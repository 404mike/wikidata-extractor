In January 1989, Williams led Sutton United, of the Football Conference, to a notable FA Cup win over top-division Coventry City. A teacher of English Literature by profession, Williams was known for quoting Shakespeare and Kipling, as well as smoking a pipe. \nWilliams took charge of Hendon for their 1992\u201393 Isthmian League campaign.Williams later emigrated to Spain, where he died on 23 April 2018, aged 80.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England women's national football team", "response": ["At the 1987 European Competition for Women's Football, England again reached the semi-finals but lost 3\u20132 after extra time against holders Sweden, in a repeat of the previous final.
