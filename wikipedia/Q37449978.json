Along with her sister Rita Martin, was the most commercially successful women portraitists of the early 20th century.Lallie Charles was born in Ireland. In about 1895 she married London photographer Georges Garet-Charles, whom she divorced around 1902. She was  a society photographer. In 1896 she opened her first studio, called \"The Nook\", at 1 Titchfield Road, Regent's Park, London. In 1897 Rita Martin, her sister, went to work with her In 1906 Martin opened her own studio at 27 Baker Street and the two sisters became competitors.Charles was inspired by Alice Hughes; other pioneer women photographers of her time, other than her sister, are: Christina Broom, Kate Pragnell and Lizzie Caswall Smith. Mme Yevonde was an apprentice of Charles, and Cecil Beaton, as a young man, posed for a family portrait, an experience he later described in his book Photobiography. Talking about the sisters, Beaton said: \"Rita Martin and her sister, Lallie Charles, the rival photographer, posed their sitters in a soft conservatory-looking light, making all hair deliriously fashionable to be photo-lowered\".  Charles was secondly married to Herbert Carr, and died in Mayfair, London, on 5 April 1919.A small selection of negatives by Lallie Charles and Rita Martin are preserved at the National Portrait Gallery donated by their niece Lallie Charles Cowell in 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yevonde Middleton", "response": ["Instead, Cumbers sought, and was given, a three-year apprenticeship with the portrait photographer Lallie Charles. With the technical grounding she received from working with Charles, and a gift of \u00a3250 from her father, at the age of 21 Yevonde set up her own studio at 92 Victoria Street, London, and began to make a name for herself by inviting well-known figures to sit for free. Before long her pictures were appearing in society magazines such as the Tatler and The Sketch. Her style quickly moved away from the stiff \"pouter pigeon\" look of Lallie Charles, toward a still formal, but more creative, style. Her subjects were often pictured looking away from the camera, and she began using props to creative effect."]}, {"page": "Rita Martin", "response": ["In 1897 Martin became a photographer working for her elder sister Lallie Charles, a society photographer. Charles' studio was called \"The Nook\", 1 Titchfield Road, Regent's Park, London. In 1906 she opened her own studio at 27 Baker Street. She specialized in portraits in pale colours against a pure white background. Her main subjects were actresses (Winifred Barnes, Lily Elsie, Julia James, Lily Brayton and Violet Vanbrugh) and children (Gladys Cooper's two children). She influenced many other photographers, especially in child portraits, and her influence can be seen in many of the popular French and German photographs of children taken at the beginning of the 20th century.", "She was inspired by Alice Hughes; other pioneer women photographers of her time are: Christina Broom, Kate Pragnell and Lizzie Caswall Smith. Talking about her, Cecil Beaton said: \"Rita Martin, and the pale terracotta loveliness of her photographs are part and parcel of this period.
