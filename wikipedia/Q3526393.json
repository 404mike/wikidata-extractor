He currently plays for Surrey County Cricket Club and the England cricket team. Plunkett was a part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup.In the 2005 season he was Durham's leading first-class wicket-taker, and that year was called up to the England squad to tour Pakistan in November and December where he played his first Tests and One Day Internationals (ODIs). Between November 2005 and June 2007 Plunkett played 9 Test and 27 ODIs before being dropped by England.\nIn 2011 and 2012, Plunkett struggled with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. Looking for a fresh start he changed clubs, moving from Durham to Yorkshire for the start of the 2013 season. Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.\nPrimarily a bowler, Plunkett also has two first-class centuries to his name and a batting average of about 24. As proof of his worth as a tailender, after just 18 ODI games he held a part of both the 8th and 9th wicket partnership records for England.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of One Day International cricket records", "response": ["|Liam Plunkett ||  || 31 || 459 || 25.50 || 2005\u20132019"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["After regaining promotion swiftly, Gillespie set about revamping the side, enticing Ryan Sidebottom to return to his home county, as well as signing Jack Brooks and Liam Plunkett, allowing Yorkshire to build a fearsome pace attack.
