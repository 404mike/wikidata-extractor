He was born in Barrow-in-Furness, then in Lancashire, now Cumbria, and died in Coventry.\nMelville was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler who played alongside good quality cricketers in matches for Coventry during the Second World War, and was brought into the somewhat-makeshift Warwickshire side for a couple of matches in 1946 at the age of 37. He had no success as a batsman, but bowling with Eric Hollies he took five Hampshire wickets in his debut match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Melville", "response": ["James Melville or Melvill may refer to:", "* James Melville (Scottish minister) (1556\u20131614),  Scottish divine and reformer", "* James Melville of Halhill (1535\u20131617),  Scottish diplomat and memoir writer", "* James Melville (politician) (1885\u20131931), British Labour Party Member of Parliament for Gateshead 1929\u20131931", "* James Melville (author) (1931\u20132014), pseudonym of British author Roy Peter Martin", "* James Melville (cricketer, born 1909) (1909\u20131961), English cricketer for Warwickshire", "* James Melville (cricketer, born 1936) (1936\u20132016), English cricketer for Kent"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* James Melville (1946) : J.
