In a 2015 London Review of Books article, investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted\u2014citing US sources\u2014that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the US mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer, who was paid an estimated $25\u00a0million for the information.
