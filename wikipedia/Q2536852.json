In addition, there were many copies and forgeries of his work made in the period immediately after his death."]}, {"page": "Goodrich Castle", "response": ["During the 1780s the concept of the picturesque ruin was popularised by the English clergyman William Gilpin. Goodrich Castle was one of the ruins he captured in his book Observations on the River Wye in 1782, writing that the castle was an example of the \"correctly picturesque\" landscape.Malgrave, p. 60. By this time, the castle was in a slow state of decay. Theodore Fielding, an early Victorian historian, noted how the \"castle's situation, far from human dwellings, and the stillness which that solitude, insures to its precinct, leaves contemplation to all the solemnity, that is inspired by the sight of grandeur sinking in dignity, into decay\".Fielding, p. 62. The Regency and Victorian watercolour artists David Cox and William Callow also captured Goodrich Castle and its landscape in paint, again invoking the picturesque, romantic mood of the setting at the time.Hargreaves, p. 184."]}, {"page": "Sidney Richard Percy", "response": ["Percy traveled in 1865 to Venice with his friend and neighbor the water colour artist William Callow (1812\u20131908), and returned visiting Switzerland and Paris.Reynolds (1980), p. 109-110. Although war between Prussia and Austria in 1866 put an end to these travels, he returned home to ample artistic inspiration in the Welsh countryside, where he spent many days painting in and around the villages of Llanbedr and Arthog, on either side of the Mawddach estuary in Merioneth. He also made painting forays to the Scottish Highlands."]}, {"page": "Charles Bentley (painter)", "response": ["Bentley was born in 1805 or 1806, the son of a master-carpenter and builder living in Tottenham Court Road, London. He was sent to work colouring prints for Theodore Fielding to whom he was eventually apprenticed in order to learn aquatinting. Bentley became a lifelong friend of another, rather younger, pupil of Fielding, William Callow. During his apprenticeship he was sent to Paris, probably to assist work on the plates for Excursion sur les Cotes et dans les Ports de Normandie' (Paris, 1823-5), most of which were after watercolours by Richard Bonington.", "After the end of his apprenticeship, though earning some money from engraving or designing plates for periodicals, Bentley turned increasingly to painting watercolours. He exhibited four works at the first Exhibition of the New Society of Painters in Water-Colours, (later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours) in 1832, and six the next year. He was then living at 15, Bateman's Buildings, a narrow turning on the south side of Soho Square, where he remained for another six years. In February 1834, Bentley was elected an Associate-Exhibitor of the Old Water-Colour Society (later the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours). By 1838 he had moved to 11, Mornington Place, Hampstead Road, where, except for a three-year break (when he lived with William Callow in Charlotte Street) he spent the rest of his life. His exhibits at the Old Water-Colour Society in 1838 included two imaginative compositions :From the Red Rover, depicting a naval battle, and From Tom Cringle's Log, which represented a sinking slave-ship. He showed at the British Institution for the first time in 1843, and the next year became a full member of the \"Old Society\" . In 1851 he showed at the Society of British Artists."]}, {"page": "John Callow", "response": ["John Callow was born in 1822. He was taught by his brother, the artist William Callow. He became a member of the New Watercolour Society, and an associate of  the Old Watercolour Society. He was junior professor of drawing at the  Royal Military College,  Addiscombe from 1855 to 1861. According to H.M. Vibart, writing in 1894, Callow \"never became a favourite of the cadets, for he was a jaundiced, saturnine character with no good-humour or geniality about him.\" He was master of landscape at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, 1861\u20131865, and  professor at Queen's College, London, 1875\u20131878. He painted marine subjects and landscapes, mostly in watercolour. He died in 1878 in New Cross, south-east London."]}, {"page": "Thomas Shotter Boys", "response": ["Boys was born at Pentonville, London, on 2 January 1803. He was articled to the engraver George Cooke. When his apprenticeship came to an end he went to Paris where he met and came under the influence of Richard Parkes Bonington, who persuaded him to abandon engraving for painting. Some sources describe him as a pupil of Bonington, although William Callow, who later shared a studio with him in Paris, disputed this."]}, {"page": "Ambrose Poynter", "response": ["Poynter lived in Paris between 1830 and 1832, where Lavinia Forster (his mother-in-law from 1832) provided a social centre for artists. They included William Callow and Richard Parkes Bonington, as well as the sculptor Henri de Triqueti who had married another daughter. Poynter sketched with, and studied watercolour painting under, Thomas Shotter Boys, who was a lifelong friend. He was an architectural draughtsman, and provided illustrations and articles in Charles Knight's Pictorial History of England (1837\u201344), and his edition of Shakespeare. He was a member of the Arundel Society and the Graphic Society. A student also of heraldry, he made drawings to illustrate Francis Sandford's Genealogical History of England."]}, {"page": "George Dodgson Callow", "response": ["Callow was born in Liverpool in 1829; according to the Parish Register of St Nicholas Church in Liverpool, he was christened on 20 April.
