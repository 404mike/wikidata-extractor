He is the chief recruitment officer at Luton Town, a club where he has spent a large portion of both his playing and non-playing career. In addition to two separate spells as a player at Luton, including as part of the team that won the League Cup in 1988, Harford has been the club's director of football, first-team coach and manager; the latter role saw him lead Luton to victory in the Football League Trophy in 2009 & gloriously return in the 2018-19 season to guide The Hatters to champions of League One.\nHarford began his career in 1977 with Lincoln City, later moving to Newcastle United and Bristol City. He moved to First Division side Birmingham City in 1982 and thereafter spent 16 seasons playing in the top division of English football for a number of clubs including Luton, Derby County, Chelsea, hometown club Sunderland, Coventry City and Wimbledon. During his time at Luton, Harford was capped twice by England. In total, Harford's transfer fees over his playing career amounted to over \u00a32.25 million.\nAs well as his non-playing roles at Luton, Harford was manager of Rotherham United in 2005 and has been caretaker manager of both Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers. He has also held assistant manager positions at Colchester United, MK Dons and Millwall, and coaching roles at Wimbledon and Swindon Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luton Town F.C.", "response": ["While Newell's place was taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later former player Mick Harford, the team was then relegated twice in a row, starting in 2006\u201307, and spent the latter part of the 2007\u201308 season in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its 2008\u201309 record by the Football Association and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years.

Gurney outlined his vision to, among other things, build a Formula 1 track around a 70,000-capacity stadium, share the ground with NFL and NBA franchises, and to change the club's name to London-Luton Football Club to tie in with the local airport and make it more accessible to \"customers\" living outside of Luton. Gurney also raised the possibility of Luton merging with Wimbledon, a club located over 40 miles away, in order to secure a position in the league above. This proposed destruction of the club's history and culture led to a group of supporters establishing Trust in Luton to protect the future of Luton Town and provide a unified voice to protest against Gurney's involvement. The Trust successfully convinced many supporters and local sponsors to vote with their feet and refuse to buy season tickets or invest in the club for the 2003\u201304 campaign, with the money (totalling almost \u00a3300,000) instead pledged towards the Trust. The club was later revealed to be losing \u00a3500,000 a month and, by July 2003, the players and staff had not been paid for two months.
