Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present. The Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem will be used instead, and on 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternate logo for the uniforms. IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes.\" The New York Times' Rebecca Ruiz and Tariq Panja reported the decision was \"without precedent in Olympics history\", while Sean Ingle at The Guardian noted the IOC's view that Russian doping was an \"unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport\". Hugo Lowell at the i newspaper, meanwhile, reported that the IOC nonetheless stopped short of a total ban against Russia from the Games."]}, {"page": "World Athletics", "response": ["World Athletics has since resisted demands that Russia be re-instated, on the basis that the country repeatedly failed to satisfy all the agreed criteria. The decision was supported by Sean Ingle of The Guardian who wrote in a column that World Athletics should maintain their ban on Russia through the 2016 Olympics in Rio. That meant Russian athletes could compete at all major events in the following years, including the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London and the 2018 European Championships in Berlin. In September 2018, World Athletics faced a legal challenge by Russia to overturn the suspension after the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, but Hugo Lowell of the i newspaper reported the country's status would not change. The legal case was later dropped."]}, {"page": "2002 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["With his win, Ebdon received a cheque for \u00a3260,000 and moved up to third place in the end-of-season world rankings (behind O'Sullivan and Williams). In a post-match interview, he said \"It's what I have been working for and dreaming about for the last 17 years... I wasn't ready to win it six years ago, but I've improved as a player and as a person\".  Hendry ultimately blamed his defeat on nerves and poor concentration, but also conceded that Ebdon was a stronger player than he had been in their previous world final encounter in 1996. This was Hendry's last appearance in a World Championship final, and he reached his last ranking final four years later at the 2006 UK Championship, where he again lost to Ebdon. The Guardian's Sean Ingle described the final as \"one of the sporting highlights of the year.\""]}, {"page": "Football Weekly", "response": ["Other occasional contributors include Jim Burke, Gregg Bakowski, Sean Ingle, Ryan Hunn, Elis James, Jacqui Oatley, Musa Okwonga, Rory Smith and Troy Townsend.

There, he became a fan of local club Real Oviedo. He later took a master's degree in History, followed by a PhD on 20th-century Spanish history. While in Spain performing research for his master's, he was approached by Guardian journalist and university friend Sean Ingle to write a column on Spanish football."]}, {"page": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce", "response": ["Fraser-Pryce is widely recognized as one of the greatest sprinters of all time. The second fastest woman alive, the Olympic Channel also referred to her as \"the most successful female sprinter in history\". Track & Field News listed her at number one on their annual world 100\u00a0m rankings in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019. In the 200\u00a0m, they ranked her at number two in 2012 and number one in 2013.

She was also ranked at number two in the 100\u00a0m for the 2000s decade. Sean Ingle of The Guardian lauded her achievements after the 2019 World Championships, stating that she had \"legitimate claim to be considered the greatest ever.\" Writing for CNN, Ben Church also admired her longevity, noting that her 2019 title came 11 years after her first Olympic title, with her winning time just 0.01 seconds shy of her previous personal best (set in 2012). In 2019, she was listed among BBC's 100 inspiring and influential women in the world. In 2020, after her maternity leave and return, World Athletics included her on their list of the 10 greatest comebacks in track and field."]}, {"page": "The Guardian", "response": ["*Specialist Correspondent of the Year (Sean Ingle, 2016, 2017)", "*Scoop of the Year (Daniel Taylor 2016; Martha Kelner and Sean Ingle, 2017)"]}, {"page": "Martha Kelner", "response": ["During her time at The Guardian, Kelner was shortlisted for the 2017 British Journalism Awards alongside Sean Ingle in the Sports Reporting category for their scoop on the Chris Froome failed drug test."]}, {"page": "British Sports Journalism Awards", "response": ["Michael Atherton of The Times has won all four editions of Cricket Journalist, while Daniel Taylor of The Guardian has won three editions of Football Journalist of the Year.
