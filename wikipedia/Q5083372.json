Frank Harris, a contemporary, wrote that Labouchere proposed it as a wrecking amendment to make the law seem \"ridiculous\" and thus discredit it in its entirety; some historians agree, citing Labouchere's habitual obstructionism and other attempts to sink this bill by the same means, while others write that his role in calling for more investigation into the Cleveland Street [male brothel] scandal places into context a sincere attempt to change the law permanently, stipulating more robust controls against male homosexuality. The amendment was rushed through and passed in the early hours of 7 August 1885, becoming section 11 of the Act. When Charles Warton questioned whether Labouchere's amendment had anything to do with the original intent of the bill (as expressed in its long title), the Speaker, Arthur Peel, responded that under procedural rules any amendment was permitted by leave of the House. (In 1888 standing orders were changed to restrict the type of amendment which could be made at a bill's report stage.; )"]}, {"page": "List of Old Gowers", "response": ["* Charles Warton, MP, Attorney general of Western Australia"]}, {"page": "Bridport (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Warton"]}, {"page": "Charles Wharton", "response": ["*Charles Warton (1832\u20131900), politician and businessman"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Charles Warton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Warton"]}, {"page": "Charles Nicolas Warton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Warton"]}, {"page": "CN Warton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Warton"]}, {"page": "Warton, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Warton"]}, {"page": "Herbert Vivian", "response": ["Herbert studied at Harrow School from 1879 until 1883.

The meeting had a strong impact on the young Vivian, who wrote about it later in his memoirs. In 1881, his grandfather introduced him to Thomas Bayley Potter, the Member of Parliament for Rochdale. Potter was impressed by Vivian and often took him into Parliament during his holidays. There Vivian met many of the MPs and was particularly impressed by Charles Warton, the MP for Bridport. Potter also introduced him to Lord Randolph Churchill, who inspired Vivian to take up Tory democracy. Vivian exchanged letters with Lord Randolph during his school days and continued to correspond with him for many years afterwards. Vivian later became friends with his son, Winston Churchill."]}, {"page": "Warton (surname)", "response": ["*Charles Warton (1832\u20131900) British and Australian politician"]}]}}
