After a curacy at Hatfield he spent ten years in the Army Chaplains' Department to the Territorial Army. He was in France from 1915 where he was awarded the Military Cross 'for service in the Field' and was Mentioned in Despatches. His service was summarised in 1918 as 'good report'.He served as vicar at Croydon and Tring and was then successively Rural Dean of Berkhamsted, Archdeacon of St Albans and then Bishop of Bedford. Wood was recommended for the post in 1948 by the Bishop of St Albans who, in his letter to the Prime Minister, referred to Wood's service in the Great War. Clement Attlee, like Winston Churchill, preferred men who had shown their mettle in the Great War. Wood remained in post for only 5 years because of a car crash in which he damaged his pelvis. He died on 17 January 1961.'His was one of the most unspectacular of careers of service which are the greatest strength of the Church', wrote the Church Times obituarist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bishop of Bedford", "response": ["| Thomas Wood"]}, {"page": "Thomas Wood", "response": ["Thomas Wood may refer to:", "* Thomas Wood (1708\u20131799), British MP for Middlesex", "* Thomas Wood (1777\u20131860), British MP for Breconshire", "* Thomas Wood (British Army officer) (1804\u20131872), British MP for Middlesex", "* Thomas Wood (1815\u201398) (1815\u20131898), Canadian politician", "* Thomas Wood (mayor) (1792\u20131861), mayor of Columbus, Ohio", "* Thomas Wood (soldier) (1853\u20131933), British soldier and Conservative MP for Breconshire 1892\u20131900", "* Thomas Wood (bishop of Lichfield and Coventry) (1607\u20131692), Anglican diocesan bishop", "* Thomas Wood (bishop of Bedford) (1885\u20131961), Anglican suffragan bishop", "* Thomas Wood (priest), Roman Catholic chaplain to Queen Mary of England", "* Thomas Wood (reverend) (1711\u20131778), minister in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada", "* Thomas Wood (Somerset cricketer) (1861\u20131933), English cricketer", "* Thomas Wood (composer) (1892\u20131950), English composer and author", "* E.
