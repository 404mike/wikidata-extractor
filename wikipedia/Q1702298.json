The club has also received criticism from some quarters for its poor treatment of the survivors: Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were forced to leave the flats they rented from the club to make way for new players. Berry was also notified by post that his employment with the club had been terminated. Another survivor, goalkeeper Ray Wood, complained about the lack of recognition from the club: \"We feel that we helped to build Manchester United...

Instead, he gradually replaced the older players with players as young as 16 and 17. These included right-back Bill Foulkes, centre-halves Mark Jones and Jackie Blanchflower, wingers Albert Scanlon and David Pegg and forward Billy Whelan.

Busby had gone against the wishes of Football League officials by pressing for Manchester United's participation in the European Cup and had not felt able to challenge the aircraft's pilot about taking off in heavy snow. Jean urged him to carry on with his duties in honour of the players who had died. Busby also had to face the torment of player Johnny Berry \u2013 who suffered career-ending injuries in the crash \u2013 complaining that Tommy Taylor was a poor friend for not visiting him in hospital, unaware that Taylor had been killed; Busby had been urged to keep the news from Berry at this stage, which he found particularly difficult."]}, {"page": "Bill Foulkes", "response": ["The 23 survivors were admitted to hospital, but Foulkes was discharged and spent the night in a hotel with Gregg.
