Working in the Hwange National Park area in Zimbabwe, he is the founder and executive directorof Painted Dog Research Trust (PDRT) whose mission is to both continue with research into the species and build for the future of conservation by meaningfully incorporating Zimbabwean students to develop local capacity and tomorrow\u2019s conservationists. His work has proven successful with the national pack size doubling thanks to these dedicated efforts. He is also the founder and a former director of the Painted Dog Conservation (PDC) project in Zimbabwe  which grew to be a model for conservation, incorporating antipoaching, community outreach, and child conservation education, developing long-term community conservation.\n\nDr. Rasmussen is a research associate and part time lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe; he is also affiliated with the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University in the UK where he completed his PhD. He has a diverse range of research interests with his most recent interests being trans-boundary conservation. He possesses an unswerving commitment to conservation as well as to those who wish to become a part of saving Nature.\n\nDr. Rasmussen embarks on an annual Painted Dog awareness and fundraising tour throughout the United States and Europe, visiting zoos, universities and donors. Every three years he attends the International African Painted Dog Conference bringing together wildlife managers, biologists, conservationists and zoo professionals from around the world to enhance and improve the care of African painted dogs in managed care and to assist in field conservation in the wild.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Falcon College", "response": ["* Greg Rasmussen,Isdore Guvamombe, \"I am walking on borrowed legs\", The Herald:Features, Opinion and Analysis, 1 June 2013 naturalist and survivor featured in Jaws of Death."]}, {"page": "Rasmussen", "response": ["* Greg Rasmussen (born 1955), British wildlife conservation biologist"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation personalities", "response": ["*Greg Rasmussen"]}, {"page": "Wildlife Conservation Network", "response": ["WCN hosts a semi-annual event, the Wildlife Conservation Expo, in the San Francisco Bay Area that brings together donors, partners, other conservationists and experts from around the world.

Painted Dog Conservation works to engage and incorporate local communities in protecting painted dogs in Zimbabwe. The painted dog, or African wild dog, was once common in Africa with estimates of over half a million spread among 39 countries. Current estimates put their numbers at about 3,000 only found in Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. Since PDC's creation, Zimbabwe's wild dog population has increased from 400 to 700 individuals. Painted Dog Conservation is partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Network."]}]}}
