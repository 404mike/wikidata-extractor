Persimmon started the 5/1 second choice in a field of eleven, with St Frusquin the 8/13 favourite. Ridden by John Watts, Persimmon was held up at the back of the field in the early stages as Bay Ronald and Gulistan made the running. Watts moved him forward steadily and he turned for home in third place behind Bay Ronald and St Frusquin, and the race soon developed into a match between the first and second favourites. St Frusquin had a slight advantage until the final furlong but Watts then made his challenge and Persimmon took the lead and ran on strongly to take the race by a neck, winning rather more easily than the margin suggested. The first royal victory for more than a century was greeted with prolonged and \"deafening\" cheering and \"tremendous enthusiasm\", with the police having difficulty clearing a way through the crowds for the Prince to lead in his winner.

There was an unusually small field of eight runners and the race took place on heavy ground in driving rain. Sainfoin, ridden by John Watts, was prominent from the start and disputed the lead with his stable-companion Orwell after a mile.

He was briefly headed by Superba but rallied to regain the advantage as the filly faltered and in a \"stoutly-contested\" race he prevailed by a length from Sandiway with Superba three quarters of a length back in third.
