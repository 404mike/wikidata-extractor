During the 2007\u201308 season the club enjoyed a good run in the Football League Trophy and on 4 March 2008 Grimsby booked their place at the new Wembley Stadium after beating Morecambe in a two-legged Northern Final. A Paul Bolland goal in the away first leg was enough to see Town through. They went on to play MK Dons in the Final on 30 March, losing 2\u20130 after Danny Boshell missed an early penalty. The season ended with eight straight defeats. After a 13\u2013game winless streak in the league stretching from 22 March 2008, on 15 September 2008 Alan Buckley was sacked as manager for a second time. The board appointed Mike Newell as manager. The Mariners would finish 22nd in League Two narrowly avoiding relegation on the final day. Following another slow start to the season, and despite previous backings from the Grimsby Town board, on 18 October 2009 the club's official website declared they had sacked Mike Newell due to \"irretrievable breakdown\". Neil Woods was controversially made permanent manager on 23 November 2009. The other main candidate for the job was former boss Russell Slade, but the board decided upon Woods ahead of Slade. Almost immediately Woods was dealt a blow when the club decided to do a U-turn and sell captain Ryan Bennett to Peterborough United for \u00a3500,000 despite rejecting this offer in the summer and the player only recently signing a new four-year deal. Grimsby under Woods struggled and despite winning four and drawing one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season., they were defeated 3\u20130 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years.", "|1997|| Graham Rodger || John Oster", "|  Chief Scout & Community Coach ||  Graham Rodger", "|  Graham Rodger", "|  Graham Rodger", "|  Graham Rodger"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in English football", "response": ["| Graham Rodger || Grimsby Town || 6 November 2006Grimsby Town sack manager Rodger BBC Sport.

Kilcline and Mabbutt were to clash again in the second half when Kilcline brought down Mabbutt with a tackle. Kilcline was not cautioned by referee Neil Midgley but had to be replaced by substitute Graham Rodger just a minute before the end of normal time due to the injury he himself sustained in the clash.

Though eventually it was Leeds United and Bristol City who made more of a forward approach for the player. Grimsby had also made the signing of striker Isaiah Rankin in the hope of combining the pair in an attempt to make a second assault on promotion from League Two, but Michael still had to contend with his hip injury, which was still being largely persistent. The injury was rumoured to be so bad that it possibly threatened to end his career altogether. Reddy managed to play the odd game, and soon Slade's replacement as manager Graham Rodger was dismissed by the club after a poor start to the season. In turn the club appointed Alan Buckley as his successor, the new Grimsby boss made it clear he wanted to keep Reddy who had by now had undergone hip surgery. Buckley aimed to stick by him through his injury troubles and help the player back to fitness, but with Reddy still harbouring the interests of leaving Blundell Park, he subsequently snubbed fresh contract talks in favour of listening to potential offers from Bristol City. Due to the continued hip problem, City had by now had lost interest altogether in signing him. However Leyton Orient had also made an official approach for Reddy's services, but this came to nothing in the end. Reddy had failed to respond well from his hip surgery and was forced to retire from the game."]}, {"page": "Peter Beagrie", "response": ["Beagrie left Scunthorpe United in June 2006, supposedly to concentrate on his media involvement with Sky Sports which had increased in latter years \u2013 but on 11 July 2006, he signed a one-year deal with Scunthorpe's local rivals, Grimsby Town in a player\u2013coach capacity.

He made his first appearance for the club in a 1\u20130 friendly win over Gainsborough Trinity in a game in which he set up the only goal of the game for his former Bradford teammate Isaiah Rankin. His league debut for the club was in a 3\u20132 win over Boston United on the opening day of the season. Grimsby struggled to make ground in the early stages of the season, and Beagrie often found himself playing a cameo role in first team affairs.

Barnsley attempted to sign Grimsby Town striker Michael Boulding, who had wanted to leave the club following the dismissal of Town's manager Paul Groves. Barnsley offered Town \u00a350,000 for Boulding with the option of taking Rankin on a one-month loan as part of the deal.

At the time of his appointment the club were and had been in the second tier of English football since 1998 and were heading into a third successive relegation battle despite the fact the club had briefly topped the table in September. He brought back former player Graham Rodger as his assistant and bolstered his side with several good loan signings, including Charlton Athletic duo Andy Todd and Martin Pringle. Groves managed to steer the club to safety and secured Town's place within what is now the Football League Championship for another year. The 2002\u201303 season was not as successful: the club was eventually relegated. A poor start to the 2003\u201304 season saw Groves sacked from his managerial duties in February 2004 but remarkably he was kept on as a player until the end of the season but found himself farmed out to local rivals Scunthorpe United on loan by his replacement Nicky Law.

Newey managed to keep down a regular spot at left back, despite having stiff competition from veteran Gary Croft. Slade departed Blundell Park at the end of the season, but new manager Graham Rodger convinced Newey to sign a new three-year contract with the club in the summer of 2006. Grimsby struggled in the new season, and Rodger was replaced by Alan Buckley. Newey continued to keep his place and he made a further 46 league and cup appearances in the 2006\u201307 season. In the 2007\u201308 campaign, Newey became the club's interim captain as veteran Justin Whittle spent the majority of the campaign on the substitute bench.

He did notably appear for The Mariners in their 1\u20130 League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Barwick found it hard to settle at Grimsby and some fans had given him a tough time over the fact he was a former player of rival club Scunthorpe, and the fact his performances were average never helped his cause.
