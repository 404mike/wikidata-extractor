Clayson suggests that Easton's dismissal was as a result of divide and conquer tactics by Klein, who had originally been employed to undertake some of Oldham's administrative work but was able to persuade Oldham that Easton was no longer required. Trynka says Easton was sacked in favour of the \"far more predatory Allen Klein\" by an Oldham-Jagger-Richards triumvirate. In 1968, Easton's barrister described him as having been ousted, and music writer Nicholas Schaffner later called it a purge on Oldham's part. It is likely that Richards was the prime motivator behind the move; one of the things he liked about Klein was that \"at least he was under fifty\". Easton was summarily sacked, and an attempt to buy him off failed. In October 1971, Easton launched a series of lawsuits for breach of contract against the band, Oldham, Decca, London Records, Allen Klein and Nanker Phelge. As a result, the High Court froze a million pounds-worth of the Stones' UK assets until the case was concluded. Decca was also instructed to suspend all royalty payments to the group. This process was to last many years. Wyman was, in his own words, \"the lone voice to express reservations\"."]}]}}
