He played mostly for Sheffield Cricket Club at a time when it was representative of Yorkshire as a county and he was one of the first great Yorkshire cricketers.\nMarsden's known career record consists of 55 first-class matches.  He played 99 innings and scored 1724 runs.  He made two centuries and three fifties. His highest score was 227 for Sheffield & Leicester versus Nottingham at Darnall New Ground, Sheffield in 1826. He is believed to have been an outfielder and took 44 catches.  As a bowler, he took 97 wickets with a best performance of seven wickets in one innings.In 1833, Marsden came up against Fuller Pilch in a single-wicket competition for the Championship of England.  Although Pilch had little interest in such abbreviated forms of the game, he won comfortably. Marsden died in Sheffield in 1843.", "link_mentions": {}}}
