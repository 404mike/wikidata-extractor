Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction, but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to Princess Louise, the daughter of Queen Victoria. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliot's novels and was so impressed with Adam Bede that she commissioned the artist Edward Henry Corbould to paint scenes from the book.Rosemary Ashton, \"Evans, Marian [George Eliot] (1819\u20131880)\", (Later Works) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004"]}, {"page": "Seven Champions of Christendom", "response": ["*  - by Richard Johnson, illustrated by Edward Henry Corbould"]}, {"page": "Charles Heath", "response": ["Heath married his cousin Elizabeth Petch.
