He began his training at Devizes judo club before joining Team Bath's High-Performance Training Programme in 2003, aged 16. in 2006, following a gap year, in which he trained at Tokai University in Japan, he began a degree in Business Administration at the University of Bath. The same year, coached by Jurgan Klinger, he won bronze in the European -23 Judo Championships in Moscow.He followed this up in 2007 with a silver at the European -23 Judo Championships in Salzburg and gold medal in the British National Team Trials. Following his uncle in becoming a GB judo player, in the following years, Tom Reed placed or medalled in numerous international tournaments and European Cup events, including winning gold medals in the English, Welsh and Scottish opens, a gold in the Swedish open and a silver medal in the London European Cup (British Open)Despite being British national champion in 2012 Tom Reed missed out on a place in the London 2012 Olympics to the more experienced Euan Burton. Tom had previously lost a match to Burton in the final of the 2009 GB World Cup in Birmingham.He competed for England in the men's 81 kg event at the 2014 Commonwealth Games where he won a silver medal \u2013 losing to fellow England international Owen Livesey.His efforts to qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were thwarted by a major elbow injury. In an interview, Reed stated that his elbow was \"getting arthritic and bone fragments had moved into muscle areas\".  In a December 2015 interview with the BBC, Reed stated that though the required surgery was expected to be relatively straight forward and the recovery was only expected to take six weeks, he was still unsure when tit would take place. \"The big question is when I get that surgery. I'm on a waiting list and have been waiting six months. Now it looks like after Christmas. That will only get me three or four tournaments left in the Olympic qualification [period].\"This proved to be the case and Reed was left needing 300 points from two remaining tournaments after only managing a 7th place finish in the 2016 African Open. He retired from the sport after failing to qualify shortly thereafter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Reed", "response": ["Thomas or Tom Reed may refer to:", "* Tom Reed (politician) (born 1971), representative for the state of New York", "* Tom Reed (screenwriter) (1901\u20131961), American screenwriter", "* Tom Reed (bishop) (1902\u20131995), Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide", "* Tom Reed (American football) (born 1945), American football coach", "* Tom Reed (judoka) (born 1986), British judoka"]}, {"page": "England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Tom Reed", "|align=left|Tom Reed"]}, {"page": "Owen Livesey", "response": ["At the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in Glasgow, Scotland, Livesey defeated John Muthee of Kenya in the round of 16.
