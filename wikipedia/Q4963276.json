Prior to this he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bradford from 2013 to 2019. Prior to this appointment he was Vice-Chancellor at the University of York from 2002 to 2013, and prior to this he was Head of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Division at the University of Oxford.Cantor is acknowledged as a world authority on materials manufacturing and is a former Vice-President of the Royal Academy of Engineering.He has published over 300 books and papers, with almost 15,000 citations and a Google h-index of over 50, and is on the ISI List of Most Cited Researchers.  He invented the field of High Entropy Alloys and discovered the so-called \u201cCantor alloys\u201d.  He founded the Begbroke Science Park at Oxford, and the Heslington East Campus at York.  He has chaired and been on the board of many organisations, including the National Science Learning Centre, the Science Museums Group, the Marshall Aid Commission, the UK Universities Pensions Forum, the Worldwide Universities Network, and the World Technology Universities Congress.  He has received academic prizes, honorary professorships and fellowships in the UK, USA, China and India.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christ's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Brian Cantor"]}, {"page": "University of York", "response": ["* Brian Cantor (2002\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Cantor (surname)", "response": ["* Brian Cantor (born 1948), Vice-Chancellor of the University of York, UK"]}, {"page": "University of Bradford", "response": ["*Brian Cantor (2013\u20132019)"]}, {"page": "Imran Khan", "response": ["On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed as the chancellor of University of Bradford, succeeding Baroness Lockwood.

T. H. Chang, P. Knight, and A. J. B. Vincent.  Yeh was also the first to coin the term \"high-entropy alloy\" when he attributed the high configurational entropy as the mechanism stabilizing the solid solution phase. Cantor did the first work in the field in the late 1970s and early 1980s, though he did not publish until 2004. Not knowing of Yeh's work, he did not describe his new materials as \"high-entropy\" alloys, preferring the term \"multicomponent alloys\". The base alloy he developed, equiatomic FeCrMnNiCo, has been the subject of considerable work in the field, and is known as the \"Cantor alloy\", with similar derivatives known as Cantor alloys."]}, {"page": "Cantor, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Cantor"]}, {"page": "Hazel Assender", "response": ["In 2001 Assender co-edited the book \"Aerospace Materials\" with Brian Cantor and Patrick Grant.
