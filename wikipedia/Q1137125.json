He was born in Perth, Western Australia, and died in South Harrow, London, from acute pancreatitis. He sometimes published under the pseudonyms Harry Adam Knight, Simon Ian Childer (both sometimes used together with Leroy Kettle), James Blackstone (used together with John Baxter), and John Raymond. Three movies were based on his novels\u2013Beyond Bedlam (aka Nightscare), Proteus (based on Slimer), and Carnosaur. In addition to science fiction, he also wrote a number of books about cinema and was a regular columnist with the popular UK magazine Starburst and comic  2000 AD.

Brosnan, an airship enthusiast, especially admired the dirigible finale."]}, {"page": "The Quatermass Xperiment", "response": ["John Hotchkis was originally hired to compose the music but, when he fell ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, \"I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra\". The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique.  Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, \"Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score\". Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.", "Among the critics and film historians who have reviewed The Quatermass Xperiment in the years since its release have been John Baxter who said, in Science Fiction in the Cinema (1970), \"In its time, The Quatermass Experiment was a pioneering sf film... Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties\". This view was echoed by John Brosnan in The Primal Screen (1991): \"One of the best of all alien possession movies\", he wrote, \"Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone\". Bill Warren in Keep Watching The Skies! (1982) found that \"the buildup is slightly too long and too careful\" but also said, \"It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It is still one of the best alien invasion films\". Steve Chibnall, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, describes The Quatermass Xperiment as \"one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema\". The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre (1991) as one of his favourite horror movies between 1950 and 1980 . The film director John Carpenter, who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment \"had an enormous, enormous impact on me \u2013 and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies\"."]}, {"page": "Quatermass 2", "response": ["Critical opinion of Quatermass 2 in the years since its release remains divided. Writing in Science Fiction in the Cinema, John Baxter found the film \u201ca faithful but ponderous adaptation of Kneale's TV sequel. There are effective sequences, director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur's Night (or Curse) of the Demon. Otherwise the film is indifferent\u201d. Similarly, John Brosnan, in his book The Primal Screen, wrote that \u201cQuatermass 2 isn't as good as the first one, despite a bigger budget. Again the theme is possession (all four Quatermass stories are variations on the same theme) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural. The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror, such as the V-shaped \"mark of the devil\" that all possessed people display\u201d. On the other hand, Bill Warren, in Keep Watching The Skies!, found Quatermass 2 to be \u201cone of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. It is not notably better than [The Quatermass Xperiment], but the story idea is more involving, the production is livelier and there are more events in the unfolding of the story\u201d. Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as \"extraordinary\" and, comparing it to Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Newman notes that while Don Siegel\u2019s film is \"a general allegory\" about dehumanisation and conformity, Quatermass 2 is \u201ca specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time, down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures\u201d.Jack Sullivan (ed.)

John Baxter notes in Science Fiction in the Cinema that \"Baker's unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [...] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the drill operator, driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is caught up in a whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.\"Baxter, p. 98. John Brosnan, writing in The Primal Scream, found that, \"As a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere.Brosnan, p. 149. Bill Warren in Keep Watching the Skies! said, \"The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly\".Warren, p. 339. Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the end result: he said, \"I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film.

Sean Day-Lewis wrote, \"Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s\". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass \"far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest\" while The Times found the serial to be \"a so-so affair\". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be \"a bitter reaction by a member of an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence\".Brosnan, The Primal Screen, p. 278.

The special effects deserve a mention, being ingeniously contrived and rather convincing, but the film is also noteworthy for its two unintentional references to the war that was about to engulf the world and end with the prospect of a nuclear apocalypse - Thorkel draws the power for his device from a 'radium mine' and, with his shaven head and thick, round glasses, he resembles the wartime caricature of the 'beastly Jap'\".John Brosnan.
