As he always published as Henry C. Andrews, and due to difficulty finding records, the C. was often referred to as Charles, until a record of his marriage registration was found in 2017.He lived in Knightsbridge, and was married to Anne Kennedy, the daughter of John Kennedy of Hammersmith, a nurseryman who assisted Andrews in the descriptions of the plants he illustrated.\nHe was an accomplished and unusual botanical artist, in that he was not only the artist but also the engraver, colourist, and publisher of his books in an era when most artists were only employed to draw plates. The Botanist's Repository was his first publication; issued serially in London in ten volumes between 1797 and 1812, the Repository at a half-crown an issue, provided affordable images of plants to the growing population of amateur gardeners in Britain. This was the first serious rival to the Kew publication, Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Perhaps not surprisingly, W. Botting Hemsley, a botanist who was employed by Kew, was critical of the quality of Andrews' 664 coloured plates in the Botanist's Repository:\n\n\"The drawing is usually fairly good, though not equal to some of this artist's later work... There is no pretense of giving any analysis of the flowers, but they themselves are often inexact and generally inadequate to be of any use botantically. The descriptive part is also unequal, and synonymy altogether excluded. Nevertheless, the Repository was in one sense superior to the Botanical Magazine of that date, because the majority of the plants figured were of recent introduction.\"\nAndrews' major work is considered to be his Coloured Engravings of Heaths, published in four volumes between 1794 and 1830. It focused on the many species of the genus Erica that were introduced to Great Britain from South Africa in the early and middle 19th century, leading to what has been called an \"Erica mania\" in British horticulture.Henry Andrews reportedly named the Australian flowering plant Correa after the Portuguese botanist and polymath, Jos\u00e9 Francisco Correia da Serra, who was living in exile in England from 1795 to 1797, and who pursued research with their mutual colleague Joseph Banks.According to a contemporary announcement, Andrews also taught drawing from nature and etching to private students.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Correa (plant)", "response": ["The genus Correa was first formally described in 1798 by Henry Cranke Andrews in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants and the first species he described was Correa alba.

In 1763, Michel Adanson also described several Proteaceae species, and did so under the generic names Lepidocarpus and Conocarpus.  Four more species were described, by Linnaeus (Protea pubera and P. totta in 1771, now L. calligerum and L. tottum), Peter Jonas Bergius (Leucadendron oleaefolium 1766, now Leucospermum oleifolium) and Nicolaas Laurens Burman (Leucadendron cuneiforme, now Leucospermum cuneiforme), before Carl Peter Thunberg in 1781 published a revision containing nine species now included in Leucospermum, including Protea heterophylla and P. tomentosa (now L. heterophyllum and L. tomentosum).

Henry Cranke Andrews transferred it to the genus Helichrysum based on the morphology of its receptacle in 1805, Retrieved 21 March 2012. and it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years. Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck described it as Helichrysum lucidum  in 1806, and Christiaan Hendrik Persoon as Helichrysum chrysanthum  in 1807. It was given the name Bracteantha bracteata in 1991, Retrieved 21 March 2012. when Arne Anderberg and Laurie Haegi placed the members that are known as strawflowers of the large genus Helichrysum into a new genus Bracteantha, and designated B.\u00a0bracteata as the type species. However, they were unaware that Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev had already placed X.\u00a0bracteatum  in the new, and at the time monotypic, genus Xerochrysum the previous year. This name was derived from the Greek words xeros \"dry\", and chrysum \"golden\", likely relating to the nature of the distinctive bracts. Confusion existed for a decade, with Bracteantha appearing in literature and the horticultural trade until it was clarified in 2002 that the latter name took precedence. Strawflower is the popular name for X.\u00a0bracteatum in Europe, while in Australia it is known as an everlasting or paper daisy. An alternate name in 19th-century Europe was immortelle. X.\u00a0bracteatum itself is very variable and may represent several cryptic species. Alternately, the Tasmanian species Xerochrysum bicolor may be combined with it in future taxonomic revisions.Australian Daisy Study Group, p. 57."]}, {"page": "Hibbertia", "response": ["The genus Hibbertia was first formally described in 1800 by Henry Cranke Andrews in his book The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants and the first species he described was H. volubilis, now known as H. scandens.

The shrub was first described in 1798 by English botanist James Edward Smith who concurrently erected the new genus Lambertia, the name honouring English botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. The specific name formosa is the Latin adjective for 'handsome'. English plantsman Henry Cranke Andrews wrote in 1799, \"Of all the plants yet introduced from New Holland, that have hitherto flowered with us, this unquestionably takes the lead for beauty, considering the plant altogether\", although his countryman Joseph Knight in his 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae added that the species name \"applies only to the flowers, the foliage being generally of a sickly hue\". French botanist Michel Gandoger described specimens collected at Hornsby and Port Jackson as Lambertia proxima, and material sent to him by plant collector Charles Walter as L. barbata  in 1919; these turned out to be L. formosa.
