He is professor of pure mathematics at Queen Mary, University of London.With his student Alistair Sinclair, Jerrum investigated the mixing behaviour of Markov chains to construct approximation algorithms for counting problems such as the computing the permanent, with applications in diverse fields such as matching algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical programming, statistics, physics-inspired applications, and dynamical systems. This work has been highly influential in theoretical computer science and was recognised with the G\u00f6del Prize in 1996. A refinement of these methods led to a fully polynomial-time randomised approximation algorithm for computing the permanent, for which Jerrum and his co-authors received the Fulkerson Prize in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["*Mark Jerrum \u2013 British computer scientist and computational theorist"]}, {"page": "G\u00f6del Prize", "response": ["|1996 ||Mark Jerrum and Alistair Sinclair || for work on Markov chains and the approximation of the permanent of a matrix || 1989, 1989"]}, {"page": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh", "response": ["*Mark Jerrum, professor at the University of London"]}, {"page": "Fulkerson Prize", "response": ["** Mark Jerrum, Alistair Sinclair and Eric Vigoda, for approximating the permanent.Mark Jerrum, Alistair Sinclair and Eric Vigoda, \"A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the permanent of a matrix with nonnegative entries,\" Journal of the ACM, 51 (4): 671\u2013697, 2004."]}, {"page": "Mark (given name)", "response": ["*Mark Jerrum (born 1955), British computer scientist and computational theorist"]}, {"page": "British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science", "response": ["# Mark Jerrum (1989\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "List of people by Erd\u0151s number", "response": ["* Mark Jerrum"]}]}}
