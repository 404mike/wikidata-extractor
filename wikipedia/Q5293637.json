He was born in London. In 1893 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as the Free Trade member for Cumberland. His election was declared void in December 1893, but in 1894 he won election to the seat of Montagu. Following a redistribution in 1900 he became the member for Zeehan, holding it until he was defeated in 1903. He served a final term as the member for Devonport from 1906 until 1909, when he contested Darwin unsuccessfully after the introduction of proportional representation. Urquhart was a minister from 1897 to 1899 and served as Treasurer from 1906 to 1909.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, 1893\u20131897", "response": ["| Don Urquhart || Liberal || Montagu || 1894\u20131903; 1906\u20131909", ": In December 1893, the election of the Independent member for Cumberland, Don Urquhart, who had won the seat from incumbent member Nicholas John Brown by 12 votes, was declared void.

He missed the postal cutoff for the close of nominations but saved his candidacy by engaging a motor from the Emu Bay Railway to send the form to Zeehan.  He won the sixth and final seat in Darwin at the expense of Treasurer Don Urquhart, whom he had criticised heavily in the campaign. Following his election, there was considerable debate in the media and in parliament about the possibility that he could be unseated due to being overseas and thus being unable to be personally sworn in during the first sitting of parliament. This was resolved in July by granting Whitsitt a leave of absence, allowing him to be belatedly sworn in on 21 September. He then took his seat on the government benches (of Elliott Lewis)."]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1901 Australian federal election", "response": ["||Cyril Cameron*John Keating*William MooreDavid O'Keefe* || |Jonathan BestJohn Clemons*Henry Dobson*James Macfarlane*Henry MurrayRobert Patterson || Arthur Morrisby (Ind FT)Alfred Page (Ind FT)Don Urquhart (Ind FT)James Waldron (Ind FT)Joseph Woollnough (Ind FT)"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Zeehan", "response": ["| Don Urquhart"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Cumberland (Tasmania)", "response": ["The seat was created ahead of the Assembly's first election held in 1856, and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model in 1909.
