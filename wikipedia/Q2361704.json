In 2000, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur where he replaced Ian Walker as the club's favoured keeper. In 2003, he departed Tottenham after losing his place in the team and was signed as a back-up keeper by rivals Chelsea.\nIn 2004, he moved to freshly relegated Football Championship side Leeds United where he remained until 2007. Whilst at Leeds he eventually lost his place in the team and was loaned out to Doncaster Rovers in both 2006 and 2007. In 2007, he joined Rovers on a permanent deal where he remained the club's favoured keeper until the 2012\u201313 season when he was loaned to AFC Wimbledon, the side formed after the relocation of his first club. Sullivan returned to Doncaster towards the end of the year and aided Doncaster to the League One title. In July 2013, he announced he was leaving Doncaster. After rejecting offers to prolong his playing career, he started working as a goalkeeping coach.\nBetween 1997 and 2003, Sullivan was capped 28 times by Scotland.

Although a promising rugby league player as a youth, he instead chose to concentrate on football, playing in goal for his school team from the age of \"about 11 or 12\". He quickly rose through the youth teams at local team Cleator Moor Celtic to play for the men's team when he was 15. He joined the Leeds United football academy in July 2002 after impressing former Leeds defender Peter Hampton while playing for non-league Workington in the FA Youth Cup. He spent less than a year in the academy and half a season with the reserves before making his first-team debut in January 2004, coming on as a late substitute after Paul Robinson was sent off against Middlesbrough. Two weeks later, he made his full debut, starting against Manchester United in a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford, and made one further appearance in the 2003\u201304 season against Chelsea in May 2004. Robinson left Leeds in May 2004 and Leeds signed Scottish international goalkeeper Neil Sullivan two months later to compete with Carson for a first-team place, and to help Carson develop and improve. Carson's contract was due to expire at the end of the 2004\u201305 season but Leeds were keen to retain him and in December 2004 offered him a new long-term contract. However, he chose to join Liverpool, who paid Leeds a \u00a3750,000 fee for him, in January 2005."]}]}}
