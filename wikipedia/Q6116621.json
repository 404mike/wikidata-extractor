Hunt however was bang in form having scored four goals in a Sheffield and Hallamshire County Cup semi-final tie 12 days earlier against Rotherham United. There were three main factors why Wednesday had such a crushing 7\u20130 victory on that day, firstly Norwich had a terrible away record having failed to pick up a single point on their travels. Secondly, Wednesday's England international inside right Jackie Robinson had one of his finest games for the club and created five of the six goals that Doug Hunt scored. Thirdly, Norwich's centre half Peter Burke was injured after 15 minutes and was a \"passenger\" for the rest of the game on the left wing.
