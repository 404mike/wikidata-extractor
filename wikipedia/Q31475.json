Born in Knutsford, Cheshire, he was educated first by his parents and then at schools locally and in Runcorn, Greenwich and Sedbergh.  Following his graduation from Cambridge University he was awarded a travelling scholarship, enabling him to study architecture in Germany and southern France. In 1835 he established an architectural practice in Lancaster, initially working on his own.  In 1845 he entered into partnership with Edward Paley, one of his pupils.  Sharpe's main focus was on churches, and he was a pioneer in the use of terracotta as a structural material in church building, designing what were known as \"pot\" churches, the first of which was St Stephen and All Martyrs' Church, Lever Bridge.\nHe also designed secular buildings, including residential buildings and schools, and worked on the development of railways in north-west England, designing bridges and planning new lines.  In 1851 he resigned from his architectural practice, and in 1856 he moved from Lancaster, spending the remainder of his career mainly as a railway engineer, first in North Wales, then in Switzerland and southern France.  Sharpe returned to England in 1866 to live in Scotforth near Lancaster, where he designed a final church near to his home.\nWhile working in his architectural practice, Sharpe was involved in Lancaster's civic affairs.  He was an elected town councillor and served as mayor in 1848\u201349.  Concerned about the town's poor water supply and sanitation, he championed the construction of new sewers and a waterworks.  He was a talented musician, and took part in the artistic, literary, and scientific activities in the town. Also an accomplished sportsman, he took an active interest in archery, rowing and cricket.\nSharpe achieved national recognition as an architectural historian.  He published books of detailed architectural drawings, wrote a number of articles on architecture, devised a scheme for the classification of English Gothic architectural styles, and in 1875 was awarded the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was critical of much of the restoration of medieval churches that had become a major occupation of contemporary architects. Towards the end of his career Sharpe organised expeditions to study and draw buildings in England and France.  While on such an expedition to Italy in 1877, he was taken ill and died.  His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried.  Sharpe's legacy consists of about 40 extant churches; railway features, including the Conwy Valley Line and bridges on what is now the Lancashire section of the West Coast Main Line; and his archive of architectural books, articles and drawings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of architects", "response": ["*Edmund Sharpe (1809\u20131877), English"]}, {"page": "Knutsford", "response": ["* Edmund Sharpe (1809 in Knutsford \u2013 1877) an English architect, architectural historian, railway engineer and sanitary reformer  Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 51, Sharpe, Edmund retrieved 16 July 2018"]}, {"page": "Edward Augustus Freeman", "response": ["Freeman had a particular interest in ecclesiastical architecture and visited many churches.

In 1851 he published An Essay on the Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England, which proposed the terms \"Flowing\" and \"Flamboyant\" (the latter term already in use in France, though not with exactly the same meaning, continuing right through the English Perpendicular Period) instead of Thomas Rickman's \"Decorated\", which had been generally adopted since it was first published in 1817.  The same year Edmund Sharpe published an alternative proposal, The Seven Periods of English Architecture, dividing the fenestration of the Decorated period between a Geometrical Period to 1315 followed by a Curvilinear Period to 1360.

Their work is now in ruins, and very weathered, but its original quality and aesthetic appeal cannot be questioned. The new choir was planned from the outset with a two-storey elevation of arcade and high clerestory, with aisles and quadripartite vaulting, and with a square east end as was usual in England. At six bays, it was to be as long as the nave, bringing the total length of the minster to 78 metres (255 feet) and making it one of the Riding's largest churches.

The Gothic Revival was a reaction against the neoclassical style, which had been popular in the 18th and early 19th\u00a0centuries, and it incorporated features of the Gothic style of the Middle Ages. Both Edmund Sharpe and E. G. Paley had been influenced by the Cambridge Camden Society and, more specifically, by A. W. N Pugin who believed that \"Gothic was the only correct and Christian way to build\". Sharpe had also been influenced by Thomas Rickman, and he had written papers on medieval scholarship himself. Paley had been influenced by his brother, Frederick Apthorp Paley, who was enthusiastic about Gothic architecture, and who had also been influenced by Rickman. During the time Douglas was working in Lancaster the firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in Gothic Revival style, one of which was St\u00a0Wilfrid's Church in the Cheshire village of Davenham, some  from Sandiway.

Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as the sole principal.

From school he went directly to Lancaster in 1838 to become a pupil of the architect Edmund Sharpe at the age of 15.", "Edward Paley married Frances Sharpe, Edmund Sharpe's sister, in June 1851.  They had five children: three daughters followed by two sons, the youngest of whom, Henry Anderson (known as Harry), joined his father as a partner in the practice.  The family lived initially at 35 Castle Park, near Lancaster Castle, before moving to a house to the south of Lancaster called The Greaves, which Paley designed himself.  He also converted a former workhouse into a country house for himself, called Moorgarth, at Brookhouse, near Caton to the north-east of Lancaster.  Paley was a keen Anglican churchman, initially attending Lancaster Priory, and later St Paul's Church, Brookhouse, a church that he largely rebuilt in 1866\u201367.  Paley took little interest in local politics, although he did serve as a Conservative councillor for three years from 1858; he declined to be renominated at the end of his term.  He was involved in other ways in social concerns, serving on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute.  He also played a major part in establishing the Royal Albert Asylum, designing the building and serving on its committee.  Paley shared sporting and musical interests with Sharpe, being a member of the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, and helping Sharpe to set up the Lancaster Rowing Club. Paley and his wife were members of the Lancaster Choral Society, Paley was involved with the Athenaeum Company and the Lancaster Philosophical Society, and in 1873 founded the County Club, a gentleman's club in Lancaster.  He was also interested in archaeology, and was a founder member of the Royal Archaeological Society, and a member of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society.
