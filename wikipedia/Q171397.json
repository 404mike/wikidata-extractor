He made his Formula One debut in 1993 with Jordan Grand Prix, where he achieved early notoriety for his involvement in incidents on and off the track.

His most successful season was in 1999 when he took four victories and finished second in the World Championship, two points behind McLaren driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen. In his four years with Ferrari he also finished fourth overall in 1998 and scored 22 podiums. He remains the latest driver from the United Kingdom to have represented Ferrari. He moved to Jaguar Racing in 2000, scoring the team's first podium in 2001 and his final podium in 2002.
