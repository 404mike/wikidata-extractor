Michael Stuart Follin was a computer game programmer until the late 1990s. Among other companies, he worked at Software Creations and, while there, worked on ZX Spectrum. The titles included highly rated arcade conversions of Bubble Bobble and Ghouls 'n Ghosts, as well as the innovative The Sentinel, one of the first games on the Spectrum to feature true 3D graphics. The music for these games was often written by his brother Tim Follin.\nIn CRASH issue 59, Follin cited Knight Lore, Codename MAT and Pentagram as video game classics, with Jonathan Smith as his favorite programmer. Follin's Spectrum conversion of The Sentinel was considered by fellow programmers as one of the top five classic games on that platform.After sixteen years in the computer games industry, Follin left the industry to train as a priest in the Church of England. He was subsequently ordained at Liverpool Cathedral, and as of 2010 is the vicar at St Peter's, a small Anglican church in Maghull, Merseyside. He married his wife, Lynn Follin, in 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tim Follin", "response": ["As a child, Follin had no significant music training. Leaving Liverpool's Sandown Music College after one year of studies, Follin's career began at the age of 15 working at Insight Studios, eventually scoring titles such as Agent X, Chronos, and Bubble Bobble for ZX Spectrum. Follin ended up in video games due to his older brother Mike Follin learning how to program for the ZX Spectrum and obtaining professional work at Insight, with one of Tim's first Insight works being the soundtrack to The Sentinel. Mike gave Tim a brief tutorial on creating music on the Spectrum via machine code, and Tim later wrote the music driver and soundtrack for their first professional game, Subterranean Stryker. After discovering how to create phasing sounds, Alt URL Follin was able to use a two-channel music driver to further experiment and come up with an arrangement of Stravinsky's \"The Firebird\", used for the game Star Firebirds. Follin graduated to three-channel music with his third soundtrack, Vectron. In his early career, Follin's music was praised in magazine game reviews.", "His brothers Geoff Follin and Mike Follin also worked in the video game industry as musician and programmer respectively, with both having moved on to other careers. Much like his brothers, Follin has changed careers, choosing to pursue films, television advertising and graphic design. Follin never considered himself a gamer as much as a musician or developer. Follin's website offers a brief overview of his video game music career."]}, {"page": "The Sentinel (video game)", "response": ["The Sentinel, released in the United States as The Sentry, is a puzzle video game created by Geoff Crammond, published by Firebird in 1986 for the BBC Micro and converted to the Commodore 64 (by Crammond himself), Amstrad CPC (with a cross-compiler written by Crammond), ZX Spectrum (by Mike Follin), Atari ST, Amiga (both by Steve Bak) and IBM PC compatibles (by Mark Roll). The Sentinel was among the first games to use solid-filled 3D graphics on home computers. It won numerous awards upon release and has since appeared on several \"best video games of all time\" lists."]}, {"page": "List of ZX Spectrum games", "response": ["|Bubble Bobble||Firebird Software||Mike Follin, Andrew Threllfall, Tim Follin||Taito ||1987", "|Sentinel, The||Firebird Software||Software Creations (Mike Follin, Geoff Crammond, Tim Follin)||||1987", "|Black Lamp||Firebird Software||Software Creations (Mike Follin, Andrew R.
