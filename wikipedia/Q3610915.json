The talented player made his mark scoring a massive 96 goals in the 1959\u201360 season - a club record which remains unbeaten today. He moved to Ashton United where he played alongside future England star Alan Ball and within weeks was spotted by an Anfield scout and signed for Liverpool in 1960 for \u00a31500. Although he made his debut for the club the following year it was during the 1963\u201364 season that he really came to prominence, scoring fifteen goals in 20 league games. However a bad injury suffered in the 1964 FA Charity Shield derailed Arrowsmith's career and he never recaptured the same form again, leaving to join Bury in 1968, before finishing his career at Rochdale and Macclesfield Town.Arrowsmith was described by Liverpool manager Bill Shankly as \"..a born goalscorer\".After a short illness he died in May 2005.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["Liverpool improved their league performances over the next two years, finishing third in 1967\u201368 and then second in 1968\u201369, although to Shankly himself it was \"a mediocre time in the late 1960s as we prepared for the 1970s\".Shankly, p. 109. Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record \u00a396,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly had compared the latter to Tom Finney.Shankly, p. 110. In September 1968, he paid \u00a3100,000 ()to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became \"football's first \u00a3100,000 teenager\". Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. He later recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which, in Shankly's opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.Shankly, pp. 110\u2013111."]}, {"page": "Arrowsmith (surname)", "response": ["* Alf Arrowsmith (1942\u20132005), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.
