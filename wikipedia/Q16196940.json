Fortnam is a skilled guitarist and bass guitarist, specialising in nylon-string acoustic guitar (which he plays in a style drawing both on classical techniques and the work of Nick Drake) and also sings. He is best known as the leader, conductor and principal composer of the North Sea Radio Orchestra, but also leads the smaller band Arch Garrison and was previously a key member of several other bands, most notably The Shrubbies and Lake of Puppies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Monsoon Bassoon", "response": ["Guitarists (and principal composers) Dan Chudley and Kavus Torabi have sporadically worked together on several projects sharing much of the sound and spirit of their previous band. The first of these was Miss Helsinki, a 2003 band with Richard Larcombe (bass, from Stars In Battledress) and with James Keddie drumming when available: the sound of the group was similar to that of The Monsoon Bassoon, but minus the woodwind/reeds and with considerably simpler song structures. Miss Helsinki only ever played one short gig and released only one song (\"I Felt Your Arms Around Me\", which appeared on the Useless In Bed Volume 1 released by the tiny independent label House of Stairs) as well as having been released on SoundCloud. . In 2005 Chudley, Torabi and Jamie Keddie reunited in a new rock band called Authority, this time with Craig Fortnam (North Sea Radio Orchestra, The Shrubbies, Lake Of Puppies) playing bass.

Drake and James Larcombe. The ensemble is notable for its post-modern fusion of Romantic music and later twentieth century forms, and for its bridging of the worlds of contemporary classical music, British folk music, London art rock and poetry (setting music to poems by W.B. Yeats, Thomas Hardy, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Daniel Dundas Maitland).", "For much of its existence, the NSRO was nostalgic in presentation and themes. Between 2002 and 2010, the poetry chosen for musical settings tended to be classic 18th /19th/ early 20th century pre-modernist material, chosen for \"its natural song-like meter and rhyme\".Feature on NSRO in The Octagonal blog Craig Fortnam has also set modern texts written in the same nostalgic vein. The ensemble's subtler post-modern elements are generally restricted to the musical content. Since 2010, the band's work has focussed on setting Craig Fortnam's original lyrics.", "While growing up in Kingston upon Thames and playing in psychedelic rock bands as a teenager, Craig Fortnam gravitated towards the cluster of bands surrounding the long-standing British psychedelic band Cardiacs. He went on to study composition and guitar at Dartington College of Arts. Graduating in 1990, he returned to London. During this period he composed material written for a variety of classical genres and ensembles, but also became involved with the London underground rock scene as a guitarist. One of the bands which he played in was the psychedelic acoustic band Lake of Puppies, led by Fortnam's friend (and former Cardiacs keyboard player) William D. Drake. The band gigged infrequently and recorded a few tracks, but never released an album. However, the band also featured singer and bass guitarist Sharron Saddington, whom Fortnam fell in love with. The two would also become longtime musical partners, and following their marriage, she would become known as Sharron Fortnam.", "A few demo CDs were also made available at this time. These included early recordings of Craig Fortnam's settings of Tennyson's \"The Flower\" and \"Every Day Hath Its Night\" and the Zappa-esque \"Nest of Tables\". Early (and very positive) reviews of both the EP and the concerts appeared in underground publications including Organ and Evophonic.", "In October 2004 the NSRO played a concert at Bush Hall in West London which was reviewed by John L. Walters in The Guardian. Walters drew attention to the initial difficulties in classifying the ensemble's music but drew positive conclusions: \u201cIs it ironic? Romantic retro? Or post-minimalist post-modernity? Behold the eleven-piece chamber orchestra beneath the chandeliers of Bush Hall, and you realise that Craig Fortnam, their leader and chief composer, is utterly serious in his quest for accessible, intelligent, non-trivial music\u2026. What makes the NSRO special is Fortnam's gift for orchestration, the deft and original way he puts deceptively simple materials in the hands of sophisticated performers. Melody pours from his pen on every page.\"Guardian review of NSRO at Bush Hall, 2004 by John L. Walters. Retrieved 20 October 2008", "On 31 July 2006 the North Sea Radio Orchestra performed at the Spitz, East London at a Music Orbit evening (a spin-off of the iF Festival) alongside NEM and Makeshift. The evening was presented as \"a combination of gamelan, improvisation, electronica and lyrical chamber music.\" In September 2006, an NSRO track appeared on the nu-folk compilation album Folk Off: New Folk and Psychedelia from the British Isles and North America \u2013 this was the Craig Fortnam solo performance of  \u201cGuitar Miniature\u201d.", "In October 2006 the NSRO released their debut album \u2013 North Sea Radio Orchestra \u2013 on Oof! Records. The album was recorded, engineered and mastered by former Cardiacs member Mark Cawthra and contained much of the ensemble's live set from the past three years. Tracks included Fortnam's settings of Thomas Hardy's \"Shelley's Skylark\", Yeats' \"He Gives His Beloved Certain Rhymes\" and \"He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven\", plus new instrumental \"Kingstanding\" and the part-instrumental/part-choral \"Chimes\". Other members also contributed material. William D Drake provided \"Bill's March\" and \"Mimnermus in Church\" \u2013 the latter a Drake setting of a poem by William Johnson Cory with orchestrations by Craig Fortnam \u2013  and Sharron and Craig Fortnam co-wrote the folk song \"Joy For My Heart\".", "Following the release of Birds, NSRO appearances and activity became rarer, partly due to Craig Fortnam's concentration on a smaller-scale project called Arch Garrison, the live line-up of which also featured Sharron Fortnam and James Larcombe. (The project's debut album was released on Double Six/Domino Records in February 2010.)", "Despite this, North Sea Radio Orchestra performed several concerts in 2009. On 29 May they performed a free concert in Brixton Library, London, as part of Lambeth Readers and Writers Festival. On 11 July they performed at the 'Les Tombees de la Nuit' Festival in the Opera House in Rennes, Brittany. On 22 October they played at the Union Chapel, London, as part of the Marginalise Concert Series organised by the Arctic Circle label, performing the music of one of their leading influences, Vernon Elliot (arranged by Craig Fortnam and fellow composer Laura Rossi). The playlist featured music from the animated television series The Clangers, Ivor the Engine and Pogles Wood.", "The third North Sea Radio Orchestra album, I a Moon, was released on 4 July 2011. Craig Fortnam composed the music for the album during the winter of 2010/2011, and the album was recorded at various locations in southern England on his laptop computer.", "The third NSRO album sees Craig and Sharron Fortnam changing tack in subtle but significant ways. The old poets have been sidelined in favour of self-penned lyrics that neatly reflect their very English sense of melody and the female Fortnam's light, sad, pretty, folkie-meets-chorister voice. The title-track, with its spooked electronic music box feel, provides the lines that define the mood: \"I a moon orbiting myself / Sometimes gravity pull me close.\" The words throughout the album feel like the thoughts of someone so outside of the real world that they can hover above themselves, watching their own futile attempts to connect, like a child watching ants and pondering whether to drown them. This alienated, superior feel is contrasted by the sheer beauty of Craig Fortnam's melodies, which have that knack of suddenly shifting to the one chord available that can make spines tingle and toes curl with pleasure.", "\"What a fantastic album this is, from Craig Fortnam and friends, with a strong core of English folk music and traces of (post) classical, medieval, electronica and even Krautrock in the supporting cast. Opener Morpheus miracle maker has great swooping strings and a vocal reminiscent of Kate Bush (Hounds of love era) from Sharron Fortnam (there\u2019s even room for a Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in style piano and glockenspiel trill). The title track is short, sweet, strange, driven by glockenspiel, laptop and harmonium and reminds me a bit of Montreal math poppers Oen Sujet. Heavy weather starts as a piano waltz sea-shanty but spreads its wings into string and oboe interludes and male-female counterpoint vocals, before a rousing, massed-band, chamber pop finish. Arguably the highpoint of the album, the instrumental Berliner luft carries off a motorik Neu groove on acoustic guitar alongside a bubbling Moog, with a memorable midsection stand-off between opposing string and reed choruses. It\u2019s irresistible dance music, in the way that Michael Nyman\u2019s Greenaway soundtracks are. The second half of the album has more of a pastoral feel to it, including the gorgeous medieval-style ballad The earth beneath our feet. The pulsing Moogs and frantic glockenspiels and guitars of Ring moonlets are another highlight. A work of restless genius, full of compelling, surprising and insanely catchy arrangements. This is pop music of the top drawer variety. Very beautiful.\"", "* Craig Fortnam \u2013 composer, arranger, conductor, nylon-string acoustic guitar, piano, chamber organ, laptop computer, voice ", "* Craig Fortnam also plays in Arch Garrison with NSRO bandmate James Larcombe (and sometimes Sharron Fortnam).
