He was hailed as a child prodigy and exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists from the age of 14 and at the Royal Academy of Arts from age 17. He is best known for astonishingly realistic flower paintings and still lifes painted in the 1880s, 1890s and 1900s. His major works took anything from 6 to 16 months to paint.Demand for his work fell when new artistic styles emerged in the 1900s. He fell into debt, a situation made worse when he became interested in photographic reproduction and invented a new printing process. The company he formed to perfect this process crashed and he lived the rest of his life in poverty. His paintings were forgotten about after his death, but interest revived when some started appearing in auction houses from 1972 onwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"L\"", "response": ["*Edward George Handel Lucas (1861\u20131936), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "E G Handel Lucas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward George Handel Lucas"]}, {"page": "E.
