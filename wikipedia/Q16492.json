His parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.  A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop."]}, {"page": "Ferranti Mark 1", "response": ["Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods, the parents of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, both worked on the Ferranti Mark\u00a01 and Mark\u00a01*."]}, {"page": "1924 in science", "response": ["* March 12 \u2013 Mary Lee Woods (died 2017), English mathematician and computer programmer"]}, {"page": "Woods (surname)", "response": ["* Mary Lee Woods (1924\u20132017), English mathematician and computer scientist"]}, {"page": "Science and invention in Birmingham", "response": ["Conway Berners-Lee, a mathematician and computer scientist from Birmingham, works in the team that develops the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial stored program electronic computer.
