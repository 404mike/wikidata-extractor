After that victory, however, Gillingham won only one of the next ten league games.  Scottish forward Paul Ritchie, signed on loan from Dundee, made his debut on 6 February against Northampton and scored Gillingham's first goal in a 2\u20132 draw; seven days later he scored twice as the team defeated Scarborough, only their second victory of 1993.  Fellow forward Crown, who had played intermittently in the first half of the season but not made any appearances since mid-December, came on as a substitute against Doncaster Rovers in the last game of February and scored an equalising goal in the final minute.  Gillingham ended the month one point off the bottom of the league table."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Gillingham's first match was at home to Hartlepool United and resulted in a goalless draw.  Foster made his debut, but had to be substituted after injuring his ankle.  Although he was able to continue playing for two weeks, the injury then recurred and kept him out of the team until November.  He scored his first goal for the team in the second league match of the season, a 3\u20130 victory away to Wigan Athletic; this was Gillingham's biggest win away from home for more than three years.  The team extended their unbeaten run from the start of the season to three games with a 1\u20131 draw at home to Rochdale but then lost away games against Scunthorpe United and Exeter City.  In Foster's absence, Andy Arnott was brought into the starting line-up against Scunthorpe for the first time since the opening game of the season, but neither he nor fellow forward Paul Baker was able to score in either game, with both finishing 3\u20130 to Gillingham's opponents.  In response to the lack of goals, Flanagan signed Scottish forward Paul Ritchie on loan from Dundee.  It was the second loan spell at Priestfield Stadium for Ritchie, who had played six Third Division games for Gillingham in 1993.  He scored on his second debut for Gillingham to help the team to a 3\u20131 win at home to Scarborough on 10 September."]}]}}
