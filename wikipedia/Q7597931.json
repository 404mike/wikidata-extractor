A Hawker Hurricane squadron based at RAF Coltishall, No. 242 Squadron was mainly made up of Canadians who had suffered high losses in the Battle of France and when Bader arrived were suffering from low morale. Despite initial resistance to their new commanding officer, the pilots (including such aces as Willie McKnight and Stan Turner) were soon won over by Bader's strong personality and perseverance, especially in cutting through red tape to make the squadron operational again. Bader transformed No. 242 Squadron back into an effective fighting unit. Upon the formation of No. 12 Group RAF, 242 Squadron was assigned to the Group while based at RAF Duxford. No. 242 Squadron became fully operational on 9 July 1940."]}, {"page": "Reach for the Sky", "response": ["* Lee Patterson as Flying Officer (later Group Captain) Stan Turner"]}, {"page": "No. 249 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* Gp Cpt Stan Turner DSO DFC*"]}, {"page": "Percival Stanley Turner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stan Turner (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Stan Turner (RAF)", "response": ["#REDIRECTStan Turner (RAF officer)"]}]}}
