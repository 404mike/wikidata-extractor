Other railways slowly replaced their original 'singles' with 4-4-0 locomotives that offered better traction at the cost of ultimate speed. However, in 1886 Francis Holt, manager at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway invented a practical form of steam sanding gear which allowed locomotive crews to quickly and effectively stop wheelspin. This led to the Midland reviving the 'single' in the form of the distinctive inside cylinder \"Spinners\"; eighty-five were built to five designs by Samuel Waite Johnson between 1887 and 1900.Baxter (1977), p. 55. One 115 class, No. 673, survives at the National Railway Museum, York. Concurrent with Holt's invention was the so-called Race to the North when groups of railway companies on the East Coast and West Coast routes between London and Edinburgh competed with each for the fastest journey times. For its portion of the West Coast route the Caledonian Railway used its unique 4-2-2, No. 123. This had been built in 1885 as a showpiece for the 1886 world's fair in Edinburgh rather than to fulfil a traffic need for the Caledonian, and so had used the now-unfashionable 4-2-2 'Single' layout. But when pressed into service during the Race to the North, No. 123's high speed performance and reliability made other locomotive engineers reconsider the advantages of the single-driver engine, especially when joined with the new steam-sander (No. 123 had a similar sanding system working by compressed air).

The more common side-tank version was introduced on the Great Eastern Railway by Samuel Waite Johnson in 1872, and was soon afterwards adopted by most mainline railways in the UK, and became the standard configuration for a passenger tank locomotive until about 1900. Examples have included the LSWR O2 Class, Midland Railway 2228 Class, the LSWR M7 Class and the Caledonian Railway 439 Class. The last British design of 0-4-4T were the LMS Stanier 0-4-4T of 1932 which were based on the Midland Railway 2228 Class.  Preserved 0-4-4T locomotives in the UK are SECR H class No. 263 on the Bluebell Railway, LSWR O2 class No.W24 'Calbourne' on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, LSWR M7 Nos. 245 in the National Railway Museum and 53 (as BR 30053) on the Swanage Railway, Metropolitan Railway E Class No.1 at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, CR No.419 by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society and the Duke of Sutherland's 'Dunrobin' which was brought back from Canada by Beamish Museum.

In 1868 it built five 0-6-0 tank engines for the Great Eastern Railway to the design of Samuel Waite Johnson.

On the first two locomotives independent control of high-pressure and low-pressure valve gears was available. From 1905 onwards, Johnson's successor Richard Deeley built an enlarged and simplified version, eliminating all the Smith refinements and fitting his own starting arrangement, making the engines simpler to drive. These locomotives were originally numbered 1000\u20131029, but in the 1907 renumbering scheme the five Smith/Johnson locomotives became 1000\u20131004 and the Deeley compounds 1005\u20131034. Ten more of these were added in 1908\u20131909.
