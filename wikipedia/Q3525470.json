Samuel Lucas, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Broadhead. His father had a passion for geology and botany, and Arthur developed an interest in natural science. Lucas' early childhood was spent in Cornwall, and when he was around nine years of age a move was made to Stow on the Wold in Gloucestershire. Here Lucas went to his first private school, but soon afterwards was sent to Kingswood School in Bath, where he was given a solid education in Classics, Modern Languages, and Mathematics. Lucas went to Balliol College, Oxford in 1870, with an exhibition, and associated with many people became the most distinguished of their time. He graduated with a fourth class honours degree in 1874, following pneumonia before his final examination, but he later won the Burdett-Coutts geological scholarship in 1876. Lucas then went to London to commence a medical course, and won the entrance science scholarship to the London Hospital in Whitechapel. When Lucas was halfway through his course his widower elder brother, Thomas Pennington Lucas, was ordered to leave England due to contracting tuberculosis and went to Australia.
