In a match against Burnley on 13 September 2014, he saved a penalty from Scott Arfield, as the club drew 0\u20130. After the match, his performance was praised by the returning manager Neil Warnock, saying: \"I think they broke the mould with him.

During a 2\u20131 win against Stoke City on 21 March 2015, he made an impressive display by making impressive saves and was praised by his teammate, James McArthur.

Speroni also faced a finger injury that saw him miss the club's pre\u2013season tour and upon returning from injury, he continued to spend most of the season on the substitute bench. Speroni made his first appearance of the season against Manchester United on 20 April 2016, losing 2\u20130. He then made his second appearance in the league match against Southampton in the final day of the season, losing 4\u20131 and his appearance in the match equalled John Jackson's club appearance record as a goalkeeper in all competitions. Speroni appeared as an unused substitute in the FA Cup final against Manchester United, as Crystal Palace lost 2\u20131.
