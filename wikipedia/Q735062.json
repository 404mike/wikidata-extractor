Murphy is most famous for being an influential figure at Manchester United from 1946 until the 1970s, as assistant manager, first-team coach, reserve team manager and a full-time scout, although he disliked the limelight and preferred to work quietly behind the scenes. Following the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, Murphy temporarily took over as Manchester United manager until the end of the 1957\u201358 season, steering the club through its greatest crisis. Murphy had not been on the Munich aeroplane, as he had missed the trip in order to take charge of Wales against Israel in Cardiff on the same night as Manchester United's match against Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia.
