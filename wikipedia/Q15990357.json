With the transfer of the equity jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery from the Court of Exchequer, two vice-chancellors were added in 1841 by the Chancery Act 1841, with the caveat that no successor for the second of the two new judges (James Wigram) could be appointed. Soon Lancelot Shadwell (the Vice-Chancellor of England at the time the bill came into effect) left office and the three vice-chancellors became of equal status, with the \"of England\" dropped. In 1851, Parliament relented so a successor to Wigram could be named to keep the number at three (George Turner), but again with the caveat (that proved temporary) that no future successor could be appointed. The caveat was lifted by an Act of 1852 so the number became fixed at three until the next major court reforms.Section 52 of the Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852.", "* 28 October 1841 \u2013 1850: Sir James Wigram"]}, {"page": "Wigram baronets", "response": ["Sir Joseph Wigram, James Wigram, Joseph Cotton Wigram, Loftus Wigram and George Wigram, younger sons of the first Baronet, all gained distinction.
