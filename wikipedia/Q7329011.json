He was married to Lady Majorie Sheppard.\nSheppard's firm, Richard Sheppard, Robson & Partners, founded in 1958, was responsible for the design of over eighty schools, as well as buildings at Loughborough University, the University of Leicester, Brunel University, City University, the University of Durham, the University of Newcastle, Manchester Polytechnic, Imperial College, London, and, most notably, Churchill College, Cambridge.\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and was knighted in 1981.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brunel University London", "response": ["The campus buildings were designed in the Brutalist style of architecture by Richard Sheppard, Robson & Partners, Architects.", "The original Brunel campus was designed by Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners, with many buildings retaining the 1960s 'Brutalist' architectural style.

By 1962 it was determined that the new college was to be built on the site of Oswald House, with Richard Sheppard (architect of Churchill College, Cambridge) being appointed the following year . The remnants of the Oswald House estate can be seen in the landscaped grounds and mature trees that surround the college. Over the following years a series of funding issues and debates over the student composition of the new college meant that building on the site did not begin until August 1971. It was determined that the new college should be called Collingwood College, a name chosen from a shortlist of three (the others being Cromwell College and Lumley College). With building not being complete until 1973, Collingwood's first cohort of 66 freshers were housed in Van Mildert from October 1972."]}, {"page": "1958 in architecture", "response": ["* Competition for the design of Churchill College, Cambridge, England, is won by Richard Sheppard's practice, Sheppard Robson; the competition also launches the practice of Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis."]}, {"page": "1982 in architecture", "response": ["* December 18 \u2013 Sir Richard Sheppard, English architect (born 1910)"]}, {"page": "1950 in architecture", "response": ["* Romney Avenue Infant School in Lockleaze, Bristol, England, designed by Richard Sheppard to utilize aluminium components made by the Bristol Aeroplane Company."]}, {"page": "1910 in architecture", "response": ["* July 2 \u2013 Richard Sheppard, English architect specializing in educational buildings (died 1982)"]}, {"page": "1944 in architecture", "response": ["* Summer \u2013 Ministry of Works (United Kingdom) builds the first demonstration British temporary prefab houses designed for postwar reconstruction (in Northolt and on Millbank in London).

In 1966, however, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner spoke of a revived Expressionism as being \"a new style, successor to my International Modern of the 1930s, a post-modern style\", and included as examples Le Corbusier's work at Ronchamp and Chandigarh, Denys Lasdun at the Royal College of Physicians in London, Richard Sheppard at Churchill College, Cambridge, and James Stirling's and James Gowan's Leicester Engineering Building, as well as Philip Johnson's own guest house at New Canaan, Connecticut. Pevsner disapproved of these buildings for their self-expression and irrationalism, but he acknowledged them as \"the legitimate style of the 1950s and 1960s\" and defined their characteristics. The job of defining Postmodernism was subsequently taken over by a younger generation who welcomed rather than rejected what they saw happening and, in the case of Robert Venturi, contributed to it."]}, {"page": "Frederick Gibberd", "response": ["A further achievement by Gibberd in planning Harlow is his incorporation of works by many leading architects of the post-war years, such as FRS Yorke, Powell & Moya, Graham Dawbarn, John Poulson, Maxwell Fry & Jane Drew, Michael Neylan, William Crabtree, Leonard Manasseh, ECP Monson, Gerard Goalen, Gerald Lacoste, Richard Sheppard and H.
