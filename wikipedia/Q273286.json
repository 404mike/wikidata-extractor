After a music school, she enjoyed an operatic career lasting for over two decades and worked with such conductors as Colin Davis and Herbert von Karajan. She was one of the few English singers of her generation to be invited to sing in productions at the Salzburg Festival and La Scala, Milan, as well as at the Metropolitan Opera.\nAfter early performances at Glyndebourne and five years at Sadler's Wells Opera Company in the 1960s, Harwood sang at Covent Garden and Scottish Opera before building an international reputation in the 1970s.  Her repertoire was extensive, but she was particularly notable for her performances in the operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss. In the concert hall, she performed in oratorio, and in her later years she concentrated on Lieder recitals.\nShe died of cancer at the age of 52.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1990 in music", "response": ["**Elizabeth Harwood, operatic soprano, 52 (cancer)"]}, {"page": "1938 in music", "response": ["*May 27 \u2013 Elizabeth Harwood, operatic soprano (d. 1990)"]}, {"page": "The Merry Widow", "response": ["In 1953, EMI's Columbia label released a near-complete versionIt omits \"Das ist der Zauber der Stillen H\u00e4uslichkeit\": see O'Connor, Patrick. \"A Viennese Whirl\", Gramophone, October 2005, p. 50 produced by Walter Legge, conducted by Otto Ackermann, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Hanna, Erich Kunz as Danilo, Nicolai Gedda as Camille and Emmy Loose as Valencienne.

Despite her comparatively weak sound projection, she occasionally performed in dramatic roles (Sieglinde, Leonore, Elsa) or comic roles (Marzelline, Rosalinde), but she was most highly regarded as Fiordiligi, Countess Rosina Almaviva, Pamina, Agathe, Arabella, Ariadne, the Angel Gabriel (The Creation), Countess Madeleine, and in sacred music. Of her interpretation of Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss, David Bowie wrote: \"Although Eleanor Steber and Lisa Della Casa do fine interpretations of this monumental work, Janowitz\u2019s performance [...] has been described, rightly, as transcendental. It aches with love for a life that is quietly fading.
