Five audience members were invited to follow the river, as it flowed from its source in the attic to 'a sea-bound chorus in the cellar, followed by a feast of foods foraged en route.' Rachel Blackman described the show in Fringe Review: 'We are invited into her bedroom for one act and her bathroom for another. We trace the river through rooms in the house, all the way down to the restaurant level, gathering cast members as the river itself gathers momentum. Finally we land in the restaurant area where we are fed a three course meal of simple, delicious fare sourced locally.'Rachel Blackman, 'The Long Lost River Song', Fringe Review, 29 May 2014 4 For this show, the company comprised Jane Bom-Bane, Eliza Skelton, Foz Foster, Colin Uttley, Freya Bowyes, Martin Peters, Lynne Thomas, Sarah Angliss and Daisy Jordan."]}]}}
