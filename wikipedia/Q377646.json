The following year he scored the first goal in Aston Villa's first FA Cup final triumph. In 1895 he collected another FA Cup winners medal with Villa. Hodgetts was also a key member of the Football League title-winning sides of 1894 and 1896.\nHodgetts was described as powerful and alert and good with both feet. He could shoot and pass expertly. He was outstanding at crossing the ball on the run. He played in Aston Villa' opening League game, as a winger, at Dudley Road, Wolverhampton, then home of Wolverhampton Wanderer's. The match ended 1-1. Denny Hodgetts played 17 of the 22 League games Aston Villa played in season 1888-89 scoring seven League goals (including 2 in a match against Everton at Dudley Road on 22 September 1888 - His debut League goal (s)) and 3 FA Cup goals finishing as Joint 3rd top scorer with Archie Hunter. As a winger he played in a midfield that achieved a big (three-League-goals-or-more-in-a-match) win on four occasions. He assisted Aston Villa to finish League runners-up.On the eve of Villa's Double-winning success in 1897 (in what would have been his third FA Cup final with Villa) Hodgetts transferred to local rivals Small Heath before retiring in 1898.\nHe made six appearances for England between 1888 and 1894, scoring once.\nHe went on to become a publican, and in 1930 was elected Aston Villa's vice-president, a position he held until his death, aged 81, in March 1945.\n\nA born football player. Remarkably clever with his feet, and possessed many original ideas. Effective in combination, an admirable coach, his skill and unselfishness having the happiest results. Shone especially in 'nursing' players lighter and less skilful than himself, many juniors coming into prominence on the strength of his tuition and example.\nThe Villa News and Record 1 Sept. 1906", "link_mentions": {}}}
