Many of his plays are structured around a time slip, and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present and future.\nIn 1940 he broadcast a series of short propaganda radio talks, which were credited with strengthening civilian morale during the Battle of Britain. In the following years his left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government and influenced the development of the welfare state.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 14", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 J.
