He issued orders that the elephants should be overpowered by blinding them and severing their trunks. After a long struggle, the Muslims finally succeeded in mutilating the elephants sufficiently to be driven off. The frightened elephant corps rushed through the Sassanid ranks and made for the river. By noon no elephants were left on the battlefield. The flight of the elephants caused considerable confusion in the Sassanid ranks. To exploit this situation even further, Sa'd ordered a general attack, and the two armies clashed once again. In spite of the Muslims' repeated charges, the Sassanids held their ground. In the absence of the Persian elephants, the Muslims once again brought up camels camouflaged as monsters. The trick did not work this time, and the Persian horses stood their ground.The countries and tribes of the Persian Gulf, By Samuel Barrett Miles, Published by Garnet & Ithaca Press, 1994, , 9781873938560"]}, {"page": "List of British representatives in Muscat and Oman", "response": ["|30 December 1872 to 7 June 1877||Samuel Barrett Miles||First time", "|4 January 1878 to 14 June 1879||Samuel Barrett Miles||Second time", "|28 October 1880 to 15 August 1881||Samuel Barrett Miles||Third time", "|20 September 1883 to 2 April 1886||Samuel Barrett Miles||Fourth time", "|1 November 1886 to 16 April 1887||Samuel Barrett Miles||Fifth time"]}]}}
