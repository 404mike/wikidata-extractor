She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music.\nCarolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or \"Unknown\".\nAlthough both working in the same genre of what might today be called traditional Scottish folksongs, Nairne and Burns display rather different attitudes in their compositions. Nairne tends to focus on an earlier romanticised version of the Scottish way of life, tinged with sadness for what is gone forever, whereas Burns displays an optimism about a better future to come.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Carolina Nairne (1766\u20131845, S)"]}, {"page": "Scottish Enlightenment", "response": ["* Carolina Nairne Lady Nairne, n\u00e9e Oliphant (1766\u20131845) writer and song collector "]}, {"page": "War poet", "response": ["Poems about the Jacobite rising of 1745 have also been written in English by Sir Walter Scott, Carolina Nairne, Agnes Maxwell MacLeod, Allan Cunningham, and William Hamilton."]}, {"page": "Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "Pub names", "response": ["* Lass O' Gowrie in Manchester, named after the poem by Carolina Nairne."]}, {"page": "Carolina Nairne, Baroness Nairne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "Baroness Nairne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "Carolina, Lady Nairne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "Carolina Oliphant", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "Lady Nairn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolina Nairne"]}, {"page": "The Hundred Pipers", "response": ["\"The Hundred Pipers\" is a Scottish song and jig attributed to Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne and popularised from 1852 onwards.
