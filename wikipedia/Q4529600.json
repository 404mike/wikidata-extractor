His father, of the same name, was a writer on music and an organist. Edwin's early education was at Lille from the age of nine until eleven, then at Echternach in Luxembourg for another four years. On returning to England, he successively worked in cable telegraphy, the stock exchange and banking, and financial journalism.Then in 1901 he started his career in music criticism, first writing on French music, championing the music of Claude Debussy in particular but also of Henri Duparc, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and Maurice Ravel. He went on to champion Russian composers, notably those associated with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, and British composers: in 1919\u201320 he wrote a series of articles on British composers for The Musical Times.He was music critic of the Pall Mall Gazette (1912\u201323), and from 1933 he was music critic for the Daily Mail, succeeding Richard Capell. In 1938 he was elected President of the International Society for Contemporary Music.  He died in London in 1945, aged 70. His private library would form the basis of the Central Music Library (now known as the Westminster Music Library) established in Westminster in the following year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gustav Holst", "response": ["The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \"the best of modern British operas\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature\u2014described by The Times as \"a brilliant puzzle\"\u2014put it outside the operatic mainstream. Only the ballet music from the opera, which The Times called \"the most brilliant thing in a work glittering with brilliant moments\", has been regularly performed since 1923.

Unlike Glock, Evans was unconvinced by the case for the inclusion of the spirituals: \"[T]he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment\".   Eric Blom, in Music & Letters, thought the idea of using spirituals \"brilliant\", and the analogy with Bach's chorales convincing. Blom was less enthusiastic about the text, which he found \"very terse and bald \u2013 rather poor, really\"\u2014though he thought this  preferable to the pomposities such as those that  characterise libretti written for Handel.  In his autobiography, Tippett makes only  muted references to the premiere, noting that the event \"had some mixed reviews\", but in a letter to his friend Francesca Allinson he professed himself delighted  with the breadth of response to the work: \"It's got over not only to the ordinary listeners but even to the intellectuals like [M\u00e1ty\u00e1s] Seiber, who has written to me of some of the 'lovely texture of some of the numbers'\"."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Edwin Evans (cricketer) (1849\u20131921), Australian cricketer", "*Edwin Evans (artist) (1860\u20131946), American painter from Utah", "*Edwin Evans (music critic) (1874\u20131945), English music critic"]}, {"page": "Natasha Spender", "response": ["She was born in London.

The society intended to put on several Sunday evening and Monday afternoon performances each season at a West End theatre, commissioning the choreography and decor for each ballet and hiring an orchestra for each performance.
