Noted psychologists Dr Don Bannister and Dr James Hemming were CW members, and via Hemming and Wintringham so did their friend Ernst Schumacher make contributions to party thought. CW enthusiastically adopted the 'executive-sensory nexus' model of organisation, derived from left/right brain theory.  Under this, the Executive Committee, responsible for current decision-making, is shadowed by a scrutiny panel, known in CW as the Sensory Committee, whose role is monitoring and review, research and longer-term development.  CW's interest in optimising social organisation consistent with its principles also led it to develop close links with the School of Integrative Social Research at Braziers Park, Oxfordshire."]}, {"page": "Conway Hall Ethical Society", "response": ["*James Hemming, in whose name the Society administers an annual prize since 2009"]}, {"page": "Hemming", "response": ["* James Hemming (1909\u20132007), British child psychologist, educationalist and humanist."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society of Arts", "response": ["* James Hemming"]}, {"page": "R v Penguin Books Ltd", "response": ["During examination of James Hemming the question was submitted by Gardiner whether reference to other books was permissible as evidence with respect to the author\u2019s intention and particularly the production of other books to show by way of comparison what the climate of literature was and how well the authorial intention was carried out; further, that the 1959 Act had changed the law regarding judging the work as a whole and whether the Act required proof of criminal intent. Gardiner\u2019s contention was that intent to deprave and corrupt was a rebuttable one and hence evidence can be called to prove there was no intent to deprave. In reply, Griffith-Jones cited R v Montalk 1932 that \"the offence of uttering and publishing an obscene libel [...] is established as soon as the Prosecution has proved the publication and obscenity of the matter charged, and a jury should not be directed that, beyond this, they must find an intent to corrupt public morals.'\" Gardiner countered that while he accepted the prosecution's argument in R v Montalk that intent to corrupt public morals is inferred from the act of publication, that presumption is itself a matter of fact and rebuttable."]}, {"page": "Hemming, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Hemming"]}]}}
