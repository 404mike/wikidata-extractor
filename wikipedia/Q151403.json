In his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History (1841), he argued that the actions of the \"Great Man\" play a key role in history, claiming that \"the history of the world is but the biography of great men\". Other major works include The French Revolution: A History, 3 vols (1837) and The History of Friedrich II of Prussia, Called Frederick the Great, 6 vols (1858\u201365).His 1837 history of the French Revolution was the inspiration for Charles Dickens's 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, and remains popular today. The influence on American literature of his 1836 Sartor Resartus, a novel both satirical and philosophical, has been described as \"difficult to overstate\".A noted polemicist, Carlyle coined the term \"the dismal science\" for economics, in his essay \"Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question\", which satirically advocated for the reintroduction of slavery to the West Indies to highlight his perceived hypocrisy of British abolitionists' indifference to domestic child-labour and slave-like working conditions in contemporary factories. John Carey in \"The truculent genius of Thomas Carlyle\", a review in Books and Bookmen in 1983, says: \"The standard view, which is that Carlyle was so poisonous it's a wonder his mind didn't infect his bloodstream.\"  On Carlyle's attitude to slavery he adds: \"Carlyle was a racist, with a rare talent for misreading historical trends.\" Likewise, Charles Darwin, in his autobiography, called his views of slavery \"Revolting. In his eyes might was right.\"\nHe also wrote articles for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.In mathematics, he is known for the Carlyle circle, a method used in quadratic equations and for developing ruler-and-compass constructions of regular polygons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allah", "response": ["The history of the name All\u0101h in English was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century; for example, Thomas Carlyle (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God.

The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist George Meredith, himself no dandy, once defined cynicism as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; Thomas Carlyle wrote in Sartor Resartus that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". Honor\u00e9 de Balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in La fille aux yeux d'or (1835), a part of La Com\u00e9die Humaine, who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.", "In 1836 Thomas Carlyle wrote: A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes.

And now, for all this perennial Martyrdom, and Poesy, and even Prophecy, what is it that the Dandy asks in return?

The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Third Edition), Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 2002. In his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions, works, ideas, and characters of \"heroes\", giving detailed analysis of six types: The hero as divinity (such as Odin), prophet (such as Mohamet), poet (such as Shakespeare), priest (such as Martin Luther), man of letters (such as Rousseau), and king (such as Napoleon). Carlyle also argued that the study of great men was \"profitable\" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's own true nature.Carlyle, Thomas.

The first volume was accidentally burned by John Stuart Mill's maid. Carlyle rewrote it from scratch.John D. Rosenberg, Carlyle and the Burden of History  (1985). Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action, often using the present tense. He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's The French Revolution was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events. Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise.

A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of James Elishama Smith, who was a millenarian and a Christian Israelite. Although an early follower of Robert Owen, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property and found in individualism a \"universalism\" that allowed for the development of the \"original genius\". Without individualism, Smith argued that individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.
