He is best known as an editor of William Wordsworth and Dorothy Wordsworth.  He was an Oxford Professor of Poetry from 1928 to 1933 and a Fellow of University College, Oxford. After a distinguished career at Oxford, he became a Professor of English at Birmingham. Early in his career he taught in the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where his students included Virginia Woolf (then Virginia Stephen). His papers are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.\nDe S\u00e9lincourt went to France in March 1917 as a professor with the YMCA and this service is duly recorded in the First World War medal rolls. He married Ethel Shawcross in 1896 in the Battle, Sussex, registration District. At the time of the 1911 census they had four children. She died in Oxford in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["The CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: Eugene Goossens and Adrian Boult. For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by Ernest de S\u00e9lincourt that this idea was unworkable. Boult had recently replaced Henry Wood as the conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society \u2013 possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra \u2013 and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO's new Director and Conductor. At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the Leipzig Conservatory under Arthur Nikisch, conducted the world premier of Holst's The Planets at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue. His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a \"golden period\" for the orchestra that would see it rise to national prominence, outshining the struggling London orchestras and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life."]}, {"page": "Orion (mythology)", "response": ["In Endymion (1818), John Keats includes the line \"Or blind Orion hungry for the morn\", thought to be inspired by Poussin.
