Hamish Bowles, curator of the \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed her popularity to a sense of unknown that was felt in her withdrawal from the public which he dubbed \"immensely appealing\". After her death, Kelly Barber referred to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as \"the most intriguing woman in the world\", furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation with valuable causes. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony summarized that the former First Lady \"became an aspirational figure of that era, one whose privilege might not be easily reached by a majority of Americans but which others could strive to emulate\".
