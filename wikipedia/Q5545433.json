Serious ill-health and the need for a warmer climate saw Valentine leave the family business and emigrate to New Zealand with his family in 1884. He continued with his career of photography and produced a significant body of work.\nIn 1885, he photographed the famous Pink and White Terraces and, after the destruction of the area by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886, photographed the area again creating a definitive record of this natural disaster. The Pink and White Terrace locations were finally mapped in 2017 after a lost 1859 survey was recovered and analysed.He produced many of what were to become the classic iconic images of early New Zealand, including geyser studies in the thermal region and studies of New Zealand bush and waterfalls.\nValentine died in 1890, just six years after his arrival in New Zealand.His work is represented in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Auckland Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
