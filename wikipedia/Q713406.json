In his early years his  signature style was a fusion of Breakbeat and Progressive House music; more recently, however, he is regarded as a Progressive House, Techno and Acid House DJ although his use of Breakbeat music is still key to some parts of his sets. He is known for his turntable skills, extensive use of loops and effects, and the use of Pioneer CDJ-2000s, EFX1000, RMX1000 as well as using Ableton Live with various controllers and sometimes an iPad.Zabiela first gained fame in 2000 by winning Muzik Magazine's Bedroom Bedlam competition, Best Bedroom Bedlam DJ 2001.Since 2005, he has received sponsorships from Japanese manufacturer Pioneer, a relationship which continues until today.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sasha (DJ)", "response": ["After achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as BT and James Zabiela. His use of live audio engineering equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on records and turntables. In 2007, he formed a record label with Renaissance Records called emFire, which is the exclusive outlet for his new music.", "After the release of Airdrawndagger, Sasha took the young DJ James Zabiela \"under his wing\". He introduced Zabiela to the CDJ1000 turntable, and signed Zabiela to the Excession talent agency. The two toured the United States together, which extended Sasha's influence to already-popular American DJs such as Kimball Collins."]}, {"page": "Exit (festival)", "response": ["|Kelis (cancelled), Dizzee Rascal, The Cult, Scissor Sisters, The Cardigans, Dave Clarke, David Guetta, Derrick May, Eric Prydz, Hern\u00e1n Catt\u00e1neo, James Zabiela, Jeff Mills, Junior Jack, Kid Cr\u00e8me, Layo & Bushwacka!, Nick Warren, Steve Lawler, Umek, Simian Mobile Disco, James Holden, Steve Angello b2b Sebastian Ingrosso, Switch, Loco Dice, Moonspell, Krafty Kuts & Dynamite MC, Soulfly Jam, Andy C & MCGQ, Suzanne Vega, Rambo Amadeus, Let 3, Massimo Savi\u0107, Darkwood Dub, Kiril D\u017eajkovski w/ Esma Red\u017eepova & Vlada Divljan, Dog Eat Dog, Pendulum, Madball, Neno Belan, Junkie XL, Siddharta, Partibrejkers, Van Gogh, Eyesburn, Block Out, \u0160aban Bajramovi\u0107, Kanda, Kod\u017ea i Neboj\u0161a, Foltin, Kal, Orthodox Celts, Limewax, E-Play, Ritam Nereda, Obojeni program, Mar\u010delo, F\u00e9lix Lajk\u00f3, Garavi Sokak, Zbogom Brus Li, Blla Blla Blla, Slavic Soul Party!, Tamara Obrovac, Slobodan Trkulja, Cubismo, The Beat Fleet, Chicks on Speed, Darko Rundek, LTJ Bukem & MC Conrad (cancelled), DJs Are Not Rock Stars aka Princess Superstar & Alexander Technique, The Streets (cancelled), Goldie, Plejboj, Vlatko Stefanovski Trio", "|Sasha b2b John Digweed, Richie Hawtin b2b Dubfire, Steve Lawler b2b Lee Burridge, Eric Prydz b2b Adam Beyer, Carl Cox b2b Green Velvet, James Zabiela b2b Nic Fanciulli, Steve Angello b2b Sebastian Ingrosso, Sander Kleinenberg b2b Darren Emerson, Kissy Sell Out b2b Alex Metric, Patti Smith, Grandmaster Flash, Roots Manuva, Fucked Up, Ebony Bones, Loco Dice b2b Magda, The Herbaliser, Majke, Partibrejkers, E-Play, Max Romeo, Hladno pivo, Delinquent Habits, Baloji, Mando Diao, Buzzcocks, Atheist Rap, Buraka Som Sistema, Addictive TV, Trio Mocot\u00f3, Cibelle, Amon Tobin, Death Angel, Kataklysm, Keep of Kalessin, The Stone, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Deathstars, Sabaton, Comeback Kid, Walls of Jericho, Hatcha, Fake Blood (cancelled), Surkin, Orgasmic, DJ Marky with MC Dynamite, Heidi b2b Justin Martin, Gui Boratto, Marko Nasti\u0107 b2b Valentino Kanzyani, Paul Woolford b2b Yousef, Japanese Popstars, Darkwood Dub, Sub Focus, Caspa, Rusko, Overdrive, Andy C, Fabio, Grooverider, Obojeni program, Kenny Kenn, Skibadee, Chase & Status, MC Rage, Takura, Plan B, Dark Angel, Orthodox Celts, Bernays Propaganda, Lollobrigida, Dubioza Kolektiv, zZz, Stalingrad Cowgirls, Jarboli, DJ Marfox, Mar\u010delo, Ne\u017eni Dalibor, Vuneny, Love Hunters", "|Deadmau5, Underworld, Groove Armada, Kreator, Bad Religion, Carl Craig, Fedde Le Grand, Digitalism, House of Pain, Marco Carola, DJ Sneak, Paul Kalkbrenner, Magnetic Man, Parkway Drive, Anti-Nowhere League, Partibrejkers, Beirut, Go Back to the Zoo, Discharge, Steve Aoki, Tiga, Rebel Rave, James Zabiela, SARS, Hadouken!, Laibach, Joris Voorn, Arkona, Better Lost Than Stupid, De Staat, Darkwood Dub, Gramophonedzie, Nosaj Thing, Atheist Rap, Maya Jane Coles, DJ Muggs, The Hacker, Digital Soundboy, Danny Byrd & MC Dynamite, Photek, Joachim Garraud, Spy ft.
