In 2020\u201321 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021\u201322. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions. Perhaps its most famous result came in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club's successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington and Paul Lambert."]}, {"page": "Basil Brush", "response": ["Also in 1993, Basil appeared alongside Roy Hattersley on the BBC comedy series Fantasy Football League with Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, it was his first television appearance in a decade.Fantasy Football League [Series 1, Episode 10] [1993/94] His fantasy football team for the series included Norwich City midfielder Ruel Fox."]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Keegan then strengthened his side by signing Swiss World Cup defender Marc Hottiger and Belgium's defensive midfielder Philippe Albert, while Norwich City's quick winger Ruel Fox had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994."]}, {"page": "Montserrat national football team", "response": ["*  Ruel Fox (2004)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bramall Lane", "response": ["|MF ||7 || Ruel Fox"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 FA Premier League", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Ruel Fox"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 FA Premier League", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Ruel Fox"]}, {"page": "Steve Harper", "response": ["On 11 September 2013, Newcastle honoured Harper for his 20 years at the club with a Testimonial against an A.C.

Duberry was approached again, later in his career, whilst playing for St Johnstone. However, he declined again despite the team training in Enfield, close to where he grew up."]}]}}
