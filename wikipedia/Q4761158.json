This was the very first use of feedback on a rock record. Speaking in one of his last interviews \u2014 with the BBC's Andy Peebles \u2014 Lennon said this was the first intentional use of feedback on a music record. In The Beatles Anthology series, George Harrison said that the feedback started accidentally when a guitar was placed on an amplifier but that Lennon had worked out how to achieve the effect live on stage.
