He claimed the Liberals were increasingly worried about the rise of political labour and the threat this represented to Liberal electoral hopes. It was ironic that this charge was levelled at Walton, as he had stood aside as Liberal candidate in Battersea only the previous year when John Burns, the trade unionist indicated he proposed to stand in the seat at the 1892 election as an Independent Labour candidate.J.
