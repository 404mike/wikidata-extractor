Despite having no formal training in aerodynamics, he became one of the world's foremost designers of jet engines. He was involved with the Rolls-Royce company in a variety of roles for almost 30 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rover Company", "response": ["A need for greater expertise within the project, along with difficult relations between Rover management and Frank Whittle (not least because Rover under AM approval had secretly designed a different engine layout, known within Rover as the B.26, which they thought was superior), led to Rover handing over their part in the jet engine project and the Barnoldswick factory to Rolls-Royce in exchange for the latter's Meteor tank engine factory at Ascot Road, Nottingham, the result of a handshake deal between Rover's Spencer Wilks and Rolls-Royce's Ernest Hives made in a local inn in Clitheroe. The official hand-over date was 1 April 1943, though there was a considerable overlap, and several key Rover staff such as Adrian Lombard and John Herriot, the latter being at Rover on secondment from the Air Inspection Department (AID) of the AM, moved to Rolls-Royce. In exchange for the jet engine project and its facilities, Rover was given the contract and production equipment to make Meteor tank engines, which continued until 1964. The Meteor engine was superseded for new tanks in 1962, and as Rover wanted more manufacturing capacity for the Land Rover they transferred the manufacture of Meteor spare parts for the British and other governments  back to Rolls-Royce at Shrewsbury. Although Rolls-Royce under Stanley Hooker were soon to be able to start producing the Whittle-designed W.2B/23 engine (known within Rover as the B.23, later named by Rolls-Royce the Welland), they evaluated the 4 Lombard/Herriot re-designed Rover W.2B/B.26 engines under test at the time of the takeover, and selected the Rover design for their own jet engine development (it became the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine)."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce RB211", "response": ["According to Cownie, Gunston, Hayward and the UK Department of Trade & Industry (DTI), the roots of the advanced RB.178 go back to 1961 when Rolls-Royce officially initiated work on a high by-pass ratio aero-engine as a replacement for the Conway. The company went ahead with the project and under the leadership of Adrian Lombard built the twin-spool demonstrator. Overall development costs of the RB.178 was \u00a32.6 million. As a comparison, the GE and P&W companies were awarded nearly $20 million by the US DoD ( Department of Defense) to develop and build the TF39 and STF200 technology demonstrators."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Nene", "response": ["The Nene was designed and built as a result of an early 1944 Air Ministry request for an engine of 4,200\u00a0lbf thrust, and an engine was schemed-out by Stanley Hooker and Adrian Lombard as the B.40. In the summer of 1944 Hooker visited the US and discovered that General Electric already had two engine types, an axial and a centrifugal, of 4,000\u00a0lbf thrust running. On returning to the UK Hooker decided to go for 5,000\u00a0lbf of thrust and, working with Lombard, Pearson and Morley, a complete redesign of the B.40 resulted in the B.41, later to be called the Nene."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Derwent", "response": ["When Rover was selected for production of Whittle's designs in 1941 they set up their main jet factory at Barnoldswick, staffed primarily by various Power Jets personnel. Maurice Wilks was also aware of the potential of a more efficient straight-through design. This layout had already been used by Whittle in his drawings of the W2Y and W3X and was also being pursued by the de Havilland Company with the Halford H.1. Wilks set up a design office at Waterloo Mill, Clitheroe with Adrian Lombard leading the design of an engine with this configuration. The design was done in secret and was sanctioned by the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) but Whittle believed all effort should have been directed towards flight testing of the reverse-flow engine."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Welland", "response": ["The engine was originally developed by Frank Whittle's team at Power Jets and known as the W.2, Whittle's second design and the first intended for eventual production. Power Jets was working with Rover who referred to it as the W.2B/23. The relationship between the companies was strained due to Rover's inability to deliver working parts, and broke when Whittle learned that a team of Rover engineers led by Adrian Lombard and John Herriot had designed their own version, the W.2B/26.Note; Whittle had been unaware that Lombard and Herriott had been expressly ordered by the MAP to develop a potentially more-powerful \"straight-through\" adaptation of the W2 engine which had been made possible by the newly-available turbine material Nimonic. Although known by Whittle to be less thermodynamically efficient than a \"straight-through\" design, and thus potentially able to develop less thrust, he had originally devised the \"reverse-flow\" design to counter the very limited heat and creep resistant properties of the turbine materials available when it had been designed, the extended gas path allowing a useful reduction in gas temperature before entry to the turbine. The availability of the Nimonic range of alloys completely removed this limitation.", "Rover handed over a total of 32 W.2B/23 engines to Rolls-Royce as well as four \"straight-through\" W.2B/26 engines, developed by Rover's Adrian Lombard. The W.2B/23 became the RB.23 Welland and the W.2B/26 became the RB.26 Derwent. Adrian Lombard moved with the engines from Rover to Rolls-Royce. Stanley Hooker helped in the task of ironing out the remaining problems, and things soon improved. A flight-quality /23 was fitted to a Gloster G.40, an updated version of the E.28 that had flown the W.1, and was flown by John Grierson on 1 March 1943. Starting in April, the ratings had been improved to  thrust, and achieved  on 7 May 1943. The prototype F.9/40 was finally fitted with  engines and was flown by Michael Daunt on 24 July 1943.", "From October 1943 a total of 167 Wellands were dispatched from the Rolls-Royce facility at Barnoldswick. By this point, Adrian Lombard's straight-through design, which became the Rolls-Royce Derwent, had proved more reliable and produced more thrust, and production of the Welland ended."]}, {"page": "Timeline of jet power", "response": ["* January 1: Rolls takes over the Rover plants, although the official date is several months later. Stanley Hooker leads a team including Fred Morley, Arthur Rubbra and Harry Pearson. Several Rover engineers decide to stay on as well, including Adrian Lombard, leader of Rover's \"offshoot\" design team. They focus on making the W.2B production quality as soon as possible."]}, {"page": "Fleur Lombard", "response": ["The plaque at the site her ashes are interred records her parents as Roger and Jane Lombard and that she had a sister Rebecca.
