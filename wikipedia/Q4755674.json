However, some Board decisions caused controversy in the 1970s when it banned a series of films that were released uncut and were popular in other countries (such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Last House on the Left), or released other controversial films, such as Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange. However, under recent presidents Andreas Whittam Smith and Sir Quentin Thomas, guidelines were relaxed again, allowing the release, usually uncut, of these previously banned films on video and in cinemas. Some films from the 1970s remain unreleased. However, many of these titles remain banned primarily because their distributors have not chosen to re-submit the films to the BBFC, almost certainly for commercial reasons; if re-submitted, they would be likely to receive a more sympathetic hearing than 30 to 40 years ago. Two notable examples from this period include the 1969 film Love Camp 7, rejected in 2002, and Women in Cellblock 9, released in 1977 and rejected in 2004. Both films contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and have remained completely banned following a re-submission since 2000.", "* Andreas Whittam Smith (18 December 1997 \u2013 1 August 2002)"]}, {"page": "Andreas Whittam Smith CBE", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andreas Whittam Smith"]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people with PPE degrees", "response": ["* Andreas Whittam Smith, former editor of The Independent newspaper"]}, {"page": "Andreas Whittam-Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andreas Whittam Smith"]}]}}
