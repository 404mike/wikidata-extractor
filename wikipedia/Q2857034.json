This was despite finances being tight at Sunderland as the club saved the money to build the Stadium of Light. However, after just 4 wins in the opening 14 matches of 1991\u201392, Smith decided to sell star striker Gabbiadini to Crystal Palace for \u00a31.8\u00a0million in order to raise funds to improve the squad. He then spent \u00a3350,000 on Celtic left-back Anton Rogan and brought in strikers Don Goodman (\u00a3900,000 from West Bromwich Albion) and John Byrne (\u00a3225,000 from Brighton & Hove Albion).

Walker and McAvennie forged a successful partnership up front whilst Paul McStay enjoyed his finest season, winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers player of the year awards.  Celtic clinched the league title on 23 April 1988 with a 3\u20130 win over Dundee in front of what appeared to be an overcrowded Celtic Park.  The latter stages of the Scottish Cup provided plenty drama for fans.  In the semi-final against Hearts, Celtic trailed 0\u20131 going into the final three minutes and looked devoid of inspiration until Hearts' goalkeeper Henry Smith fumbled a cross which was thumped into the goal by Mark McGhee to level the match.  A replay looked certain until in injury time, Smith under pressure from McGhee failed to deal with another ball into the box, with Andy Walker scoring the winner from close range.  The Cup Final, on 14 May 1987, saw Dundee United take the lead early in the second half.  Frank McAvennie equalised in 75 minutes, heading an Anton Rogan cross past United goalkeeper Billy Thomson.  With about a minute remaining, McAvennie scored again to win the Cup for Celtic."]}, {"page": "1966 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*25 March \u2013 Anton Rogan, Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "1992 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|LB ||5 || Anton Rogan"]}, {"page": "1966 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*25 March - Anton Rogan, footballer."]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. international footballers", "response": ["*Anton Rogan"]}, {"page": "Rogan", "response": ["* Anton Rogan, Irish soccer player "]}, {"page": "1990 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["Aberdeen won the match 9\u20138 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw over 90 minutes of normal play and 30 minutes of extra-time.
