In 1787, he met and found work as an assistant for Edward Webb of Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, a surveyor. He was quick to learn, and soon became proficient at the trade. In 1791, he travelled to Somerset to make a valuation survey of the Sutton Court estate, and building on earlier work in the same area by John Strachey. He stayed in the area for the next eight years, working first for Webb and later for the Somersetshire Coal Canal Company, living at Rugborne Farm in High Littleton. During this period, Smith inspected a number of coal mines in the area, where he first observed and recorded the various layers of rock and coal exposed by the mining; Smith's coal mine studies, combined with his subsequent observations of the strata exposed by canal excavations, proved crucial to the formation of his theories of stratigraphy."]}, {"page": "Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"| Edward Webb"]}, {"page": "Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle", "response": ["* Edward Webb 1756\u20131788"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|1 October 1816||Gloucester||c*||Robert Morris||Edward Webb||Death"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Webb||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Webb||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Webb||Whig"]}, {"page": "Edward Webb (disambiguation)", "response": ["Edward Webb was a politician.", "Edward Webb may also refer to:", "*Edward Webb (silversmith)", "*Edward Webb and Sons, seed merchants"]}, {"page": "James Adcock", "response": ["He was a native of Eton, Berkshire, England.
