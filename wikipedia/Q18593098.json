Toynbee Hall had been founded in 1884, and female students resolved to set up a similar project. Representatives from Girton College and Newnham College at Cambridge University, and Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville College at Oxford University, formed the Women's University Association. A Newnham student Alice Gruner was appointed Head Worker, and the organization was based at her house at 44 Nelson Square, Southwark. Other Newnham students involved in the venture included Mary Paley Marshall, Nora Sidgwick, and the Prime Minister's daughter Helen Gladstone. Octavia Hill, who became a housing reformer and founder of the National Trust, was also an active member. In 1888 the Association was renamed the Women's University Settlement. Gruber resigned as Warden, and in 1891 a paid Warden, Margaret Sewell, was appointed. By 1895 the Settlement had 31 resident and 61 non-resident workers. It organized children's clubs, holiday treats and classes in music and dance for local children. Helen Gladstone served as Warden in the early twentieth century. ", "By 1912 the Settlement had started to train social workers for work elsewhere. However, its lack of institutional funding forced a public appeal for funds, to buy a hall and ensure a secure financial footing.Avebury, Thomas Barlow, Charles Booth, C.

In 1926 the Settlement's activities included a baby centre, a mixed children's club for boys and girls, the Southwark Boys' Aid Association, work on care committees and remedial exercises and light treatment for children. Graham Wallas, presiding at the organization's AGM, saw it as exemplifying the way in which social work had moved from Victorian amateurism to professional activity on scientific lines.\"Women's University Settlement: Professor Graham Wallas on Social Work\", The Times, 24 March 1926, p. 18.
