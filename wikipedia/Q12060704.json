He has been a faculty member at the University of Arizona since 1986. Impey has done research on observational cosmology, in particular low surface brightness galaxies, the intergalactic medium, and surveys of active galaxies and quasars. As an educator, he has pioneered the use of instructional technology for teaching science to undergraduate non-science majors. He has written many technical articles and a series of popular science books:  Einstein's Monsters  The Living Cosmos, How It Ends, How It Began, Dreams of Other Worlds, and Humble Before the Void. He served as Vice-President of the American Astronomical Society, he is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.

The book starts with a discussion of the human urge to explore, which led us to fan out over the Earth soon after leaving Africa. This urge may have a gene associated with it. This is followed by a recounting of the Space Race of the middle of the 20th century, driven by fierce superpower rivalry between the United States and the former Soviet Union. Early milestones in the history of space travel are summarized, along with the feats and tribulations of human (and animal) space explorers. The \"club\" of those who have been in Earth orbit is still very select, less than 550, compared to ten times more people who have stood on the summit of Mount Everest.", "Beyond was a starred selection by Publishers Weekly, with a review that concludes \"With vivid writing that skillfully walks the line between visionary and pragmatic, Impey finds equal opportunity for both humans and robotic explorers on a journey that could not only teach us about new worlds, but how to be better caretakers of this one.\" The book also had a good review in Kirkus Reviews. The Arizona NPR affiliate devoted segment to the book and a general discussion of space travel.
