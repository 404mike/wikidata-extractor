His result was later generalized by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1960. This mechanism was proposed by D. J. Acheson and Raymond Hide (1973) to perhaps play a role in the context of the Earth's geodynamo problem. Although there was some follow-up work in later decades (Fricke, 1969; Acheson and Hide 1972; Acheson and Gibbons 1978), the generality and power of the instability were not fully appreciated until 1991, when Steven A. Balbus and John F. Hawley gave a relatively simple elucidation and physical explanation of this important process."]}, {"page": "1990 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Professor Raymond Hide, Chief Scientific Officer, Meteorological Office."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Raymond Hide||18/03/1971||"]}, {"page": "Tim Palmer (physicist)", "response": ["After a chance meeting with geophysicist Raymond Hide, he became interested in climate and was employed by the Met Office \u2013 including a year at the University of Washington.
