The book goes on to look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that \u00a310 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Philip Oppenheimer (1911\u20131995), British diamond dealer"]}, {"page": "Mir mine", "response": ["The rapid development of the Mir mine had worried the De Beers company, which at that time led a cartel that controlled distribution of most of the world's diamonds. De Beers had to buy Soviet diamonds in order to control the market price, and therefore needed to know as much as possible about the Russian mining developments. In the 1970s, in the midst of a proxy cold war in Southern Africa, De Beers requested permission to visit the Mir mine. Permission was granted under the condition that Soviet experts would visit De Beers diamond mines in South Africa. De Beers executive Sir Philip Oppenheimer and chief geologist Barry Hawthorne arrived in Moscow in the summer of 1976. They were intentionally delayed in Moscow by the arrangement of a series of meetings and lavish banquets with Soviet geologists, mineralogists, engineers, and mine managers. When Oppenheimer and Hawthorne finally reached the Mir mine, their visas were about to expire, so that they could only stay for 20 minutes. Even that short time was sufficient to get some important details. For example, the Soviets did not use water during the ore processing at all, which was astonishing to De Beers. The reason was that water would freeze most of the year, and dry crushing was used instead. De Beers also overestimated the size of the mine's pit."]}, {"page": "Prix de Psych\u00e9", "response": ["| Philip Oppenheimer"]}, {"page": "Grosser Preis von Baden", "response": ["| Sir Philip Oppenheimer"]}, {"page": "Chipping Norton set", "response": ["*Emily Oppenheimer Turner, journalist and painter, and William Turner, businessman.
