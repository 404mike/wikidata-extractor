She made her West End debut in 1914 and soon gained notice in revues and light comedies, becoming known for her parodies of old-fashioned, flowery performing styles and absurd songs and sketches. She debuted in New York in 1924 and two years later starred in her first film, continuing to perform in both the US and UK. She was associated with revues staged by Andr\u00e9 Charlot and works of No\u00ebl Coward and Cole Porter, and frequently was paired with Gertrude Lawrence, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley.\nDuring World War II, Lillie was an inveterate entertainer of the troops. She won a Tony Award in 1953 for her revue An Evening with Beatrice Lillie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lesbian", "response": ["No location saw more visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than Harlem, the predominantly African American section of New York City.
