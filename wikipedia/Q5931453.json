It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson. The assumption explained on the web page is that as Pattinson had ample time to walk into the picture, he opened the shutter and then positioned himself at the chosen spot, keeping still there for some minutes. The image is left-right inverted and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of Horseshoe Falls; these were then transferred to engravings to illustrate No\u00ebl Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841\u20131864)."]}, {"page": "Daguerreotype", "response": ["* Hugh Lee Pattinson"]}, {"page": "Alston, Cumbria", "response": ["The town hall is a focal point for the community, being a venue for many local social events.

Inspired to become an entrepreneur he took over the Walker ironworks on his father's death in 1845.  In 1850 at Washington, County Durham, Bell made a breakthrough discovering a new process for manufacturing lead oxychloride.  His partners and co-founders of the Washington chemical company, named after his home, were his brother-in-law Robert Benson Bowman and his father-in-law Hugh Lee Pattinson.

It exploited the fact that in molten lead containing traces of silver the first metal to solidify out of the melt is lead, leaving the remaining liquid richer in silver. Pattinson's equipment consisted basically of nothing more complex than a row of up to 13 iron pots, which were heated from below. Some lead, naturally containing a small percentage of silver, was loaded into the central pot and melted. This was then allowed to cool. As the lead solidified it is removed using large perforated iron ladles and moved to the next pot in one direction, and the remaining metal which was now richer in silver was then transferred to the next pot in the opposite direction.  The process was repeated from one pot to the next, the lead accumulating in the pot at one end and metal enriched in silver in the pot at the other.Rowe, 1983. pp 189\u2013190. The level of enrichment possible is limited by the lead-silver eutectic and typically the process stopped around 600 to 700 ounces per ton (approx 2%), so further separation is carried out by cupellation.Metallurgy - An Elementary Text Book, E.L.Rhead F.I.C F.C.S, Longmans, 1895, pp193-195", "* Newcastle University: Hugh Lee Pattinson"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["| Hugh Lee Pattinson||3 June 1852||25 December 1796 \u2013 11 November 1858"]}, {"page": "Robert Benson Bowman", "response": ["Bowman married Ellen Pattinson, daughter of the industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson and Phoebe Walton.
