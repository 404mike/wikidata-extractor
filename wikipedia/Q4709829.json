In July of that year he joined Hearts, answering an advertisement from the then reigning Scottish Cup holders. He appeared infrequently as Hearts won the 1896-97 League title but became a more regular player the following season. He played in Hearts 1900-01 Scottish Cup win, where the Edinburgh side defeated Celtic 4-3 in the final and was club captain by the time the side reached the 1902-03 final, where they lost to Rangers.Buick's appearance led many commentators to consider him an unlikely defender. He measured only 5 foot 7 inches tall, had a slight stoop and his long, gangly arms earned him the nickname \"spider\". However, his all-action style and stamina earned him many admirers and two caps for the Scottish national team in March 1902. These came against Ireland and Wales and Buick scored in both games as Scotland won 5-1 on each occasion. The stature of his contemporary and rival for the centre-half position, Alex Raisbeck, was said to have ensured he didn't win more honours.Buick moved south to Southern Football League side Portsmouth in 1903 and was eventually joined by six former Hearts teammates.  He spent eight season with Pompey, most notably helping the team to an upset victory over Manchester United in an 1906-07 FA Cup replay.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901\u201302 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Robert Hamilton (3), Bobby Walker, Albert Buick", "|John Robertson, Albert Buick, Bobby Walker, Alex Smith, John Campbell"]}, {"page": "List of Heart of Midlothian F.C. players", "response": ["|Albert Buick, London Hearts Supporters Club"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Albert Buick"]}, {"page": "Charles Thomson (footballer, born 1878)", "response": ["Thomson started his career with local side Prestonpans F.C., from where he moved to Hearts in 1898. Initially considered a centre-forward at Tynecastle, Thomson also occasionally played centre-half, and he took on that role permanently when Albert Buick left the Edinburgh club for Portsmouth in 1903. He played in the former role in the 1901 Scottish Cup final, when he scored the third goal in Hearts' 4\u20133 defeat of Celtic. Two years later he was deployed in defense but could not prevent Hearts losing the 1903 Scottish Cup final to Rangers, in a 2nd replay."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1872\u20131914)", "response": ["|Robert Hamilton (3), Robert Walker, Albert Buick||15,000 ||", "|John Robertson, Albert Buick, Alec Smith, Robert Walker, John J.
