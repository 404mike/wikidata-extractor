Woods topped the bowling averages in both his years at the school; in the first he claimed 59 wickets at an average just over eight, figures which he improved upon during his second year when he took 78 wickets at an average of 7.3. His college reports commented much more favourably on his sporting achievements than his academic ones, praising his batting, bowling and fielding alike.Jiggens (1997), pp19\u201320."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Leslie Gay \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Brighton College", "response": ["*Leslie Gay (1871\u20131949), England footballer, England cricketer 1894\u201395, Cambridge blue, Hampshire and Somerset"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 in English football", "response": ["England's final international match of the season came at Richmond Athletic Ground on 1 April against Scotland who were hoping to avenge their defeat in each of the two previous seasons.

From 1891, Somerset resumed first-class cricket status, and Newton played in the first County Championship match involving the team, against Middlesex at Lord's. In these early days of Somerset's first-class cricket, the county did not lack capable amateur wicket-keepers, and Newton shared the position with the Rev. Archdale Wickham and then Henry Martyn, with the Test player Leslie Gay intervening for a season in 1894. For the seven seasons from 1897 to 1903, Newton played fairly regularly, and his batting improved in these seasons. In 1899, his batting average was more than 20 for the only time in his career, and he made an unbeaten 64 in a high-scoring match against Surrey at Taunton. In 1900, batting in the unaccustomedly high position of No 5 in the batting order, he made 77, equalling his highest career score, in the match against Gloucestershire at Bristol: this was a good match for wicket-keeper/batsmen, with Wickham, Newton's Somerset colleague, making his highest career score with 28 and Jack Board, the Gloucestershire wicket-keeper, trumping both of them with a score of 214 to give his side an innings victory."]}, {"page": "Vernon Hill (cricketer, born 1871)", "response": ["In addition to his four matches for the University in 1893, Hill made seven appearances for Somerset that summer, but his poor form with the bat was replicated for both sides. He failed to make a first-class half-century all season, the 47 scored in Somerset's innings and 170 run victory over Gloucestershire being his top-score. His attacking style lent itself to quick scoring, but not always to making big totals. Of his 114 in the Varsity match, Wisden says that he hit with \"a power which was absolutely amazing\". In From Sammy to Jimmy: The Official History of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes his intent \"to hit every ball as far as he could\". During his time at Winchester, Hill had been used as a bowler, but was rarely used at Somerset. In 1894 against Nottinghamshire, he was brought on as the seventh change bowler, only wicket-keeper Leslie Gay and fellow opener Richard Palairet unused. In his 1.4 overs, Hill claimed three wickets for the expense of only a single run."]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Leslie Gay (1892-1894)"]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["In view of the club's financial difficulties, the board also decided to recruit top amateur players. The first to join the club was Leslie Gay, who had made three appearances as goalkeeper for England in 1893 and 1894, although Gay never played in a first-team match for Southampton. Another amateur goalkeeper, the South African Wilf Waller also joined the club on a part-time basis and played in the opening match of the season when Jack Robinson was suspended. In December, C. B. Fry (described as \"arguably the greatest all-round sportsman of his generation\") did play for the club, making his debut at right-back in the Boxing Day match against Tottenham Hotspur. In January, the club made an offer to another Corinthian player, G. O. Smith, who had been the England captain and was widely considered as the world's best player of the 19th Century.
