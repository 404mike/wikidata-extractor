This spans the period between first matches to have been given retrospective first-class status in 1772 to the formation of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. A total of 67 first-class matches were played during this period.\nCricket during this period became increasingly similar to the modern game, although bowling remained underarm until the 19th century. The first Laws of Cricket had been established in 1744 and in 1774 a revision of the Laws added Leg before wicket as a mode of dismissal. The third stump was added after 1775.Cricket scorecards became increasingly complete from 1772 onwards and the players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1772 and 1786 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berwick", "response": ["Berwick may refer to:", "*Berwick Glacier", "*Berwick, Victoria", "*City of Berwick, Victoria (defunct)", "*Berwick, New Brunswick", "*Berwick, Nova Scotia", "*Berwick, Ontario", "*Berwick, New Zealand", "*Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland", "*Berwick, East Sussex", "**Berwick railway station (East Sussex)", "*Berwick, Gloucestershire", "*Berwick Street Market, London", "*Berwick Tunnel, Shropshire", "*Berwick St John, Wiltshire", "*North Berwick, East Lothian, Scotland", "**North Berwick Law, a hill situated to the south of the town", "*County of Berwick, a historic county in south-east Scotland", "*Berwick (Parliament of Scotland constituency)", "*Berwick, Illinois", "*Berwick Township, Warren County, Illinois", "*Berwick, Iowa", "*Berwick, Kansas", "*Berwick, Louisiana", "*Berwick Bay, Louisiana", "*Berwick, Maine", "**Berwick (CDP), Maine, a census-designated place within the town", "*Berwick, Missouri", "*Berwick Township, Newton County, Missouri", "*Berwick, Ohio", "*Berwick Hotel, Cambridge, Ohio ", "*Berwick, Columbus, Ohio", "*Berwick, North Dakota", "*Berwick, Pennsylvania", "*Berwick Area School District, Pennsylvania", "*Berwick Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania", "*Berwick (surname)", "*Berwick (cricketer), English cricketer", "*Berwick Academy (disambiguation)", "*Berwick High School (disambiguation)", "*Berwick (automobile), an electric car produced in 1904", "*Berwick cockle, a confection from Berwick upon Tweed", "*Berwick Prize, in mathematics, named for William Edward Hodgson Berwick", "*Berwick RFC, a rugby union team in Berwick-upon-Tweed", "*Berwick Rangers F.C., a football team in Berwick-upon-Tweed", "*Berwick Secondary College, a secondary college in Berwick, Victoria, Australia", "*Berwick Castle, in Berwick-upon-Tweed", "*HMS Berwick, several Royal Navy ships", "*Treaty of Berwick (disambiguation), several treaties", "*Berwick railway station (disambiguation), several stations"]}, {"page": "1779 English cricket season", "response": ["* Berwick (Surrey and Hampshire)"]}, {"page": "Berwick (surname)", "response": ["Berwick is an English and Scottish surname, originating from the places of Berwick-upon-Tweed on the English-Scottish border, Berwick, Kent, Berwick, Shropshire, Berrick, Oxfordshire, Barwick, Norfolk and Barwick, Yorkshire.", "*Andrew Berwick, anglicised pseudonym of Norwegian Murderer Anders Behring Breivik", "*Baron Berwick, a title", "*Berwick (cricketer) (first name unknown)", "*Dennison Berwick (born 1956), author", "*Donald Berwick (born 1947), American professor of pediatrics and health care policy", "*Duke of Berwick, a title in the Peerage of England", "*Eleanor Berwick (born 1943), English wine-grower", "*Harry Berwick (1923\u20131988), Australian golfer", "*James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick (1670\u20131734)", "*Jeff Berwick (born 1970), Canadian businessperson and adventurer", "*Kester Berwick (1903\u20131992), Australian actor, playwright, and author", "*Nicola Berwick, (born in 1978) stunt actress", "*Stephan Berwick (born 1964), American author, martial artist, and actor", "*William Berwick (footballer) (1884\u20131948), English footballer", "*William Edward Hodgson Berwick (1888\u20131944), English mathematician"]}]}}
