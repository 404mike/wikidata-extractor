Campbell later described Frazer's work as \"monumental\". The anthropologist Weston La Barre described Frazer as \"the last of the scholastics\" in The Human Animal (1955) and wrote that Frazer's work was \"an extended footnote to a line in Virgil he felt he did not understand.\"The Human Animal (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, The Study of Culture, pp. 24f The lyrics of the musician Jim Morrison's song \"Not to Touch the Earth\" were influenced by the table of contents of The Golden Bough. The movie Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola shows the antagonist Kurtz with the book in his lair, and the film depicts his death as a ritual sacrifice as well. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's commentaries on The Golden Bough have been compiled as Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough, edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979). Robert Ackerman, in his The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the history of ideas. The myth and ritual school includes scholars Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, F. M. Cornford, and A.B. Cook, who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing Modernist literature."]}, {"page": "1943 in literature", "response": ["*January 3 \u2013 F.

M. Cornford strongly opposes any idea of a historical Timaeus: \"The very fact that a man of such distinction left not the faintest trace in political or philosophic history is against his claim to be a historical person. The probability is that Plato invented him because he required a philosopher of the Western School, eminent both in science and statesmanship, and there was no one to fill the post at the imaginary time of the dialogue\".Cornford (1937), p. 2.

The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales, dubbed the \"father of science\", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes. Pythagoras of Samos founded the Pythagorean school, which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape.  Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature.  Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry."]}, {"page": "Science in classical antiquity", "response": ["Hellenistic scholars often employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought in their scientific investigations, such as the application of mathematics to phenomena or the deliberate collection of empirical data.Lloyd (1973), p. 177.

At one extreme is the view of English classical scholar Cornford, who believed that \"all the most important and original work was done in the three centuries from 600 to 300 BC\".F. M. Cornford, The Unwritten Philosophy and Other Essays, p. 83, quoted in Lloyd (1973), p. 154.
