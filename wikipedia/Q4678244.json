He took his entire company on tour, visiting England, Germany and France, and some of the best actors on the American stage have owed their training and first successes to him. Among these were Clara Morris, Sara Jewett, John Drew, Jr., Maurice Barrymore, Fanny Davenport, Agnes Ethel, Maude Adams, Mrs. Gilbert, Tyrone Power, Sr., Ada Dyas, Isadora Duncan, Maud Jeffries and many others.  Daly's willingness to, as he put it, \"stoop to the curb and bestow upon the low, untried actor a chance at greatness\" earned him the nickname \"Little Man Auggie\" among his peers. His play Leah the Forsaken, adapted from Hermann Salomon Mosenthal's Deborah, was a star vehicle for Margaret Mather."]}, {"page": "Charles Wyndham (actor)", "response": ["Returning to London, Wyndham was then engaged for the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, and there in October and November 1867 \u2013 as the gallant Dujardin in The Double Marriage and the seducer Hawksley in Still Waters Run Deep \u2013 he once again partnered Ellen Terry.
