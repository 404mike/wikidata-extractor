Artists such as A Guy Called Gerald, Techno Animal, and the Young Gods approached sampling with a more modernist outlook than Oswald. According to theorist Kodwo Eshun, sampledelic techniques were used by artists such as Tricky and RZA of Wu-Tang Clan and Gravediggaz. 1990s acts such as Position Normal and Saint Etienne would also take a sampledelic approach to explore forgotten elements of English culture.
