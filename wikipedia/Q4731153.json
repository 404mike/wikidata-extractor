A. Clark scholar in English. He became a lecturer at King's College London in 1920 and took the chair of English at East London College (later Queen Mary's College) in 1923. In 1933 he went to Yale University as professor of the history of drama and dramatic criticism and chair of the drama department. He established a strong graduate programme in theatre history. Around 1943\u201345 he performed war work at the British embassy in Washington.  From 1945 to 1961 he headed the English Department at the University of Birmingham; from 1951 to 1961 he was also founding director of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham. He served as president of the Society for Theatre Research from 1958 to 1976.\nHis major work was his six-volume History of English Drama, 1660\u20131900, published as separate volumes starting in 1923, and reissued as a set in 1952\u201359. He also wrote many other books on English drama.\nHe was married twice and had no children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pantalone", "response": ["Pantalone is characterized as loving his money and having emotional extremes.

It stated that an 18th-century clergyman, James Wilmot, had identified Bacon as the hidden author of Shakespeare's works. Wilmot's study of local history in the Stratford area convinced him that Shakespeare could not have authored the works attributed to him.

During this period of time, theatre flourished. According to Allardyce Nicoll, author of History of Late Nineteenth Century Drama, during this time theatres became very popular with masses. Theatrical atmosphere was not particularly restricted to certain classes of the society. One of the main reasons of masses attending the theatre was the improvement in the transportation system. The streets became safer for travelling at night time, Nicoll observes, which prolonged timing for the theatre. Plays could run for a longer time now. This all led to greater profits and an increase in the number of theatres. With an increase in theatre resulting from the increase in the number of spectators, production of stage plays and drama proceeded to surpass the quantity of dramas produced in the past periods. According to Nicoll \u201cWhen rail and omnibus became popular the whole of the area north, south and west of London was brought into the association with theatre\u201d. As a result, the number of ticket buyers increased many fold. Typical audiences in those days were mostly the citizens from the lower section of the society, with some representation from the aristocracy. The great alteration, however, didn't come until the middle of the Victorian era. The greatest work done to improve theatre\u2019s perception was done by none other than Queen Victoria. The Queen\u2019s encouragements of the theatre not only pumped fresh air into the London theatre, but theatre was also understood as \u201csomething destined to yield a rich harvest in the future\u201d."]}, {"page": "1894 in Scotland", "response": ["* 28 June \u2013 Allardyce Nicoll, literary scholar (died 1976 in England)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Birmingham academics", "response": ["* Allardyce Nicoll, Head of the English Department and founding director of the Shakespeare Institute"]}, {"page": "Beth Ellis", "response": ["*The play Mr. Jarvis by Leon M.
