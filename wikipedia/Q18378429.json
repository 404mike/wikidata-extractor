Oxley was a prolific contributor to the iStockphoto site, which he had joined because of a free promotional offer for purchasers of the Adobe Creative Suite. Both companies purchased Oxley's designs from the website (Twitter paid $10\u201315 for its logo, of which Oxley received $2\u20136) but the licence did not allow them to use the works as logos. Twitter's founders redesigned their logo in response, but GitHub asked Oxley for permission, which he granted. He credits the Japanese popular art as an influence on his Twitter design and others, and said he was grateful for the wide distribution of his images despite receiving very little compensation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RateMyTeachers", "response": ["To complement the new survey and comply with GDPR, the site was entirely rebuilt and launched prior to the 2019\u201320 school year with a new look and feel. \u00a0Artist Adam Larkum was commissioned to create the imagery within the site's pages, and Simon Oxley, the graphic artist behind the Twitter bird and GitHub's Octacat was commissioned to create Owen, RMT's owl mascot."]}, {"page": "Twitter", "response": ["Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo, or the Twitter Bird. The original logo, which was simply the word Twitter, was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley. A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009. This version had been named \"Larry the Bird\" after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame."]}, {"page": "GitHub", "response": ["GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized \"octocat\" with five octopus-like arms. The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock, a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images. GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo. The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss. Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image."]}, {"page": "Oxley (surname)", "response": ["* Simon Oxley (born 1969), British graphic designer"]}]}}
