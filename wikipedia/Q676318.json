His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against Ireland. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with Bobby Moore). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed Bob Crompton's appearance record for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, Bobby Charlton. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as Bryan Robson, Kenny Sansom, John Barnes, Martin Peters, Ray Wilkins, Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer."]}, {"page": "Ian Wright", "response": ["Wright started seven matches and was used as a substitute on six occasions under Hoddle, who was manager for 28 matches.

Only Mick Channon played more times for England without being selected for a World Cup or European Championships squad. However, during Channon's England career, which spanned the years 1972\u20131977, England failed to qualify for either of these tournaments, while during Wright's they qualified for two European Championships and one World Cup.Additionally, Bob Crompton had 41 England caps but all were gained long before the foundation of either tournament."]}, {"page": "Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "response": ["The 1890\u201391 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for the fifth time against Notts County with a 3\u20131 victory.
