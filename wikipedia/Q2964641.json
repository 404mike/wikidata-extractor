He played 26 Premier League games for Forest, though played little part in the club's 1997\u201398 First Division promotion campaign. Instead he was loaned out to Luton Town and Third Division promotion winners Cardiff City, before he was allowed to sign with Port Vale in March 1999. His career diminished in brief spells with Stockport County and Brighton & Hove Albion, before he featured for non-league sides Dover Athletic, Aldershot Town and North Leigh. He retired from playing in 2010, having helped North Leigh to win promotion from the Hellenic Football League in 2007\u201308.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["In order to strengthen for 1996\u201397, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent \u00a3100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for \u00a3450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday out of the League Cup en route to a fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached \u00a313\u00a0million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for \u00a31.7\u00a0million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend \u00a3170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997\u201398 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid-table position at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["The club faced a financial crisis following the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell, and over the summer Horton was forced to sell striker Martin Foyle to Port Vale for \u00a3375,000. He made no major signings in Foyle's place, and instead handed d\u00e9buts to Paul Wanless, Chris Allen, and Bobby Ford. He also sold Paul Simpson to Derby for \u00a3650,000 in February 1992. The loss of close to \u00a31 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford ended the 1991\u201392 season one place and two points ahead of relegated Plymouth Argyle. They secured their safety with a final day win over Tranmere Rovers. At the end of the season he gave Steve McClaren his first job in management, putting him in charge of Oxford's youth-team. There was less drama in 1992\u201393, as his side finished in 14th-place, seven points above the relegation zone. Over the summer he paid Corby Town \u00a320,000 for striker Matt Murphy, and sold Andy Melville on to Sunderland for \u00a3500,000.", "In order to help the Vale to avoid relegation at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, Horton brought in five players: Dave Brammer (Manchester City), Tony Butler (Blackpool), Carl Griffiths (Leyton Orient), Alex Smith (Chester City), and Chris Allen (Nottingham Forest). This spending spree set the club back \u00a3630,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for \u00a3250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings. He won his first game in charge, a 2\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town, thanks to a brace from Martin Foyle. A five-game unbeaten run in April allowed the Vale to finish above relegated Bury on goals scored."]}, {"page": "Chris Allen", "response": ["Chris Allen may refer to:", "*Chris Allen (academic) (born 1966), British sociologist", "*Chris Allen (footballer, born 1972), English football player", "*Chris Allen (footballer, born 1989), English football player ", "*Chris Allen (ice hockey) (born 1978), Canadian ice hockey defenceman", "*Chris Allen (skier) (born 1959), Australian Olympic skier", "*Chris Allen (author) (born 1964), Australian author", "* Chris Allen (born 1952), vocalist with The Troggs", "*Chris Allen, founding member of the band Shadowkeep"]}, {"page": "Christopher Anthony Allen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Allen (footballer, born 1972)"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["| Chris Allen"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["In February, Peter Beadle was sold on to Notts County for \u00a3250,000, representing a \u00a350,000 loss.
