In the first decades, they do not appear to have been numerous, judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains.

We understand, that there are no rabbits whatever in the elder colony\" i.e., New South Wales (NSW).Colonial Times and Tasmanian Advertiser 22 May 1827 This clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in Tasmania in the early 19th century. At the same time in NSW, Cunningham noted, \"... rabbits are bred around houses, but we have yet no wild ones in enclosures...\" He also noted the scrubby, sandy rubble between Sydney and Botany Bay would be ideal for farming rabbits.Cunningham P.

This sailed to Sydney via the Cape of Good Hope and returned Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro, commanded by William Bligh who offered to introduce Arnold to Sir Joseph Banks in London. In 1811, he was posted to Haslar Hospital in Portsmouth to handle patients with malignant fever. He then served aboard HMS Alcmene, HMS Hibernia, and HMS America around the Mediterranean, during which period he made a visit to the crater of Vesuvius. A meeting with Alexander Macleay made him interested in South American insects and he chose an appointment in 1814 as surgeon superintendent aboard the female convict vessel HMS Northumberland and went collecting insects on reaching Rio de Janeiro. He reached Sydney in 1815. After 1815, he unsuccessfully tried to work as surgeon in Sydney, and upon his return trip to England aboard the Indefatigable he was stranded in Batavia and the ship caught fire with Arnold losing most of his possessions. He was aided by Charles Assey, also from Beccles, and stayed at Bogor and collected some specimens. He returned to England in May 1816 during which time he met Dawson Turner.

They reached Benkulen on 19 March 1818. Arnold then travelled on to Passemah Ulu Manna. It is thought that he may have contracted malaria on this journey. Despite being ill, he helped the wife of Captain Thomas Otho Travers and then returned to Benkulen on 8 July 1818. He then recovered and set out to the Menangkabau highlands.

He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1794 commemorating the great Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, whose Species Plantarum (1753) became the internationally accepted starting point for all botanical nomenclature and served as its secretary from 1798 to 1825.

The Greek Revival joinery is particularly fine. The siting of Elizabeth Bay House and surviving elements of Elizabeth Bay Estate provide rare examples of sophisticated Landscape design in early 19th century NSW. The estate, possibly laid out with advice from Landscape gardener Thomas Shepherd adapted design principles from the English 18th century Landscape movement to a Sydney harbourside setting with the retention of indigenous trees. Elizabeth Bay House's relationship with the villas Tusculum and Rockwall, Potts Point provides a rare key precedent for town planning in Australia. The 1826 grant of Elizabeth Bay House estate to Alexander Macleay was followed by the granting of a series of allotments along Macleay Street Potts Point to the colony's principal civil servants and one respectable merchant, under a series of villa conditions, which specified the quality and elements of the design of these houses.
