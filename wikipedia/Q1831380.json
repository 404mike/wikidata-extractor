In 1994, he won the Australian Amateur and was the leading amateur at  The Open Championship. He turned professional later that year.\nBennett failed to win a European Tour card at Qualifying School in either 1994 or 1995, and missed much of 1996 with a twisted vertebrae.In 1998, he headed the second tier Challenge Tour rankings having won five tournaments during the season, increasing his career tally at that level to seven. From 1999 to 2004 he played on the European Tour, winning his only European Tour title at the 1999 Scottish PGA Championship, but he continued to be troubled by injuries. In 2005, he played only a few events, most of them on the Challenge Tour. Bennett's best year-end ranking on the European Order of Merit was 29th in 2001.Having suffered a hand injury in a car accident, Bennett resigned from the European Tour at the start of 2009. He has since become a caddie initially for Bernd Wiesberger, and later for Trish Johnson on the Ladies European Tour.In 2017 he was appointed club professional at Chestfield Golf Club in Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Open Championship", "response": ["* 1994 \u2013  Warren Bennett"]}, {"page": "Vijay Singh", "response": ["| Warren Bennett", "| Warren Bennett"]}, {"page": "Bernhard Langer", "response": ["| Warren Bennett", "| Warren Bennett"]}, {"page": "Challenge Tour", "response": ["|1998 ||  Warren Bennett || align=right|\u00a381,053"]}, {"page": "Eisenhower Trophy", "response": ["|1994 || Versailles, France || Le Golf National (Albatros course)La Boulie (La Vall\u00e9e course) ||  (838)Todd DemseyAllen DoyleJohn HarrisTiger Woods ||  & (849)Warren BennettStephen GallacherLee S.

Commenting on the aesthetic of production music of the time, Emanuel said:  \"Bruton was one of the first production music libraries, and it was all on vinyl back then, and with a few exceptions tended to be full of people knocking out soundalikes of current hits. They'd change the chord structure round a bit and that would be it.\" Over the next fifteen years, Emanuel and Bennett received royalty payments for the Bruton soundalike album."]}]}}
