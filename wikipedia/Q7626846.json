His family came to England from South Africa in 2001, and he was educated at Cranleigh School. For cricketing purposes he is regarded as English. He is categorised by CricketArchive and Cricinfo as a right-arm fast medium bowler and a right-handed batsman. However, according to a 2011 article in The Observer in 2009 he was timed by the speed guns at the ECB's indoor school in Loughborough at 94 miles per hour (151 km/h), the highest figure for any bowler measured there. Surrey's coach Ian Salisbury said of him: \"He's always been able to bowl quick and he is a 90mph bowler, but he can also swing the ball, conventionally or reverse later on.\"He played in two \"Test\" matches for the English U-19 cricket team in 2007. He also played in six Under-19 limited overs internationals, of which the last two were in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2007\u20138.\nHe made his first-class debut for Surrey against Loughborough UCCE in a match that began on 12 April 2008. He did not bat, but took one wicket for 53 runs. He made his List A debut for Surrey against Sussex on 28 May 2008, but did not bat or bowl.\nThe end of 2008 saw him off to Australia where he played for a club side in Sydney, before returning to play with Surrey. His 2009 season at Surrey saw him significantly improve both his batting and bowling figures.\nIn September 2011, he was called into England's squad for a one-day series in India later in the year. He had taken only 19 List A wickets at the time of his selection. He made his England One Day International debut on the tour, taking a wicket in the process.\nIn early November 2012 he was added to the England squad touring India, as cover for the injured Steven Finn. In December he was selected for his first Twenty20 International.In January 2020, Surrey confirmed that they had released Meaker from his contract, and that he was to join Sussex on a two-year deal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Stuart Meaker"]}, {"page": "Cranleigh School", "response": ["* Stuart Meaker (England cricketer)"]}, {"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Surrey \u2013 Stuart Meaker", "*Surrey \u2013 Stuart Meaker"]}, {"page": "South Africans in the United Kingdom", "response": ["|Stuart Meaker"]}, {"page": "List of Adidas sponsorships", "response": ["* Stuart Meaker"]}, {"page": "James Taylor (cricketer, born 1990)", "response": ["At the age of 18, Taylor was included in Leicestershire's 12-man squad to face Worcestershire at New Road in April 2008. At the time he was still studying for his A-levels but was given permission to play. Leicestershire coach, Tim Boon, said that whether Taylor played depended on the pitch and if it merited an extra batsman. Taylor was selected and batted at seven and scored eight runs before being trapped leg before wicket (lbw) in his only innings by Kabir Ali. The game ended in a draw, as both teams were frustrated by the weather. Two months later he made his Twenty20 (T20) debut along with teammate Sam Cliff in a seven-wicket defeat against Derbyshire. Despite two late victories, including a win in the return fixture against Derbyshire at Grace Road where Taylor contributed 10, Leicestershire finished bottom of their group in the 2008 Twenty20 Cup. In a three-day tour match against Bangladesh A as part of their 2008 tour of England, Taylor made only his second first-class appearance. The match ended in a draw and Taylor made his maiden half-century of 51 from 109 balls before being caught off Shakib Al Hasan. Taylor finished his one-day season with two Natwest pro40 games against Derbyshire and Surrey. He top scored with 43 not out in a narrow six-run victory against Derbyshire and hit 37 in a loss against Surrey before being caught off youngster Stuart Meaker to end his Leicestershire season on a high. Taylor was awarded the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year for his 898 runs for Shrewsbury School in 2008, at an average of 179.60. The award also recognised his Youth International appearances and his County matches."]}, {"page": "Seren Waters", "response": ["He was born and lives in Kenya but has British nationality.
