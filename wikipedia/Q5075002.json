The trip began on 9 July. The group met formally on 14 July after the trip ended. Ware, Lutyens, and Baker agreed that every cemetery ought to obey a general theme (although the theme was not yet established), that there should only be four variations on the theme (monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries), that grave markers should be uniform headstones (not crosses), and that cemetery walls should be horizontal. Aitken insisted on cemeteries of simple design and low cost, feeling public money should be spent on practical items like schools and hospitals. Baker wanted a cross at each cemetery, but Lutyens wanted a more abstract symbol. Aitken supported Baker in thinking that a cross was more appropriate in the French countryside. At one point, Baker suggested a cross with a pentagonal shaft (one side for each self-governing dominion), and for Indian cemeteries a column topped by appropriate symbol (such as the dharmacakra or Star of India)."]}, {"page": "Fabian Ware", "response": ["In June 1917 Ware proposed a \u00a310 budget per grave (equivalent to \u00a3 in  terms), which became the standard sum for the IWGC. On 9July a committee organised by Ware, consisting of the Director of the Tate, Charles Aitken, the author J. M. Barrie, and the architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker, toured the cemeteries in order to form a plan for the post-war activities of the commission. The committee met on 14 July and decided all cemeteries should have a general theme, though one had not yet been decided. They agreed there would be four variations on the theme: monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries; and grave markers would be uniform, with no individual crosses or monuments. In August Lutyens suggested there be \"one kind of monument throughout [the cemeteries], whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa\". He suggested that his Great War Stones be used as the monument."]}, {"page": "James Bolivar Manson", "response": ["Lilian was a close friend of Tate director Charles Aitken and, in summer 1911, the Mansons stayed with him at a holiday home in Alfriston, Sussex. Manson had assisted Aitken with hanging a show at the Tate and the Director was sufficiently impressed to suggest Manson took the job of Clerk, vacant since its former occupant had been pilfering the petty cash.  Manson achieved by far the best results out of the four applicants taking the appropriate civil service exam, and, age 33, became Tate Clerk on 9 December 1912 with an annual salary of \u00a3150. His reluctance to take the job had been overcome by his wife, who wanted provision for their two daughters; he continued to paint intensely at weekends."]}, {"page": "Memorials to the Missing", "response": ["Other minor characters included Herbert Baker (Lutyens' initial opponent, going on to suggest the standard IWGC Cross of Sacrifice to Christianise the cemeteries), Charles Aitken (another architect who recommended a memorial institution rather than spending on war graves) and William Burdett-Coutts (MP for Westminster), whilst 'offstage' characters included Rudyard Kipling."]}]}}
