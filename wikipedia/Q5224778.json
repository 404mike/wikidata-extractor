Wilde only retained the services of Pop, Dorneval, and Kevin Ricketts from the previous season. He would stack up his roster with players with USL experience particularly from the Toronto Lynx.  The signings included Darren Baxter, Aaron Steele, Shawn Faria, Igor Prostran, Sergio De Luca, and CSL veterans Phil Ionadi, Sa Brahima Traore,  Marko Bedenikovic, Ryan Gamble, Domico Coddington, Angel Velazquez, Orlin Chalmers, and Paul Daccobert. Oakville immediately made an impact by posting a seven-game undefeated streak, and recorded the best offensive record. Oakville finished first in the Western Conference, but had points deducted due to discipline related violations. The deduction resulted in Oalville losing their division title by finishing as runners up. In the first round of the postseason the Blue Devils faced the Windsor Border Stars, and advanced to the semi-finals by a score of 3-1. In the semi-finals Oakville faced Hamilton Thunder, and won the match by a score of 2-0. In the CPSL Championship final match Oakville faced Vaughan Shooters during the match the Shooters struck first with a goal from Stalin Cardenas, ten minutes later De Luca scored the equalizer sending the match to overtime where Gamble came off the bench to score the winning goal and capture the organizations first championship title."]}, {"page": "2004 Voyageurs Cup", "response": ["|  Darren Baxter"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["* 6 February: Midfielder Darren Baxter and defender Nathan Simpson are released"]}, {"page": "All-time Toronto Lynx roster", "response": ["*  Darren Baxter"]}, {"page": "Darren Baxter", "response": ["Darren Baxter may refer to:", "*Darren Baxter (Australian footballer) (born 1965)", "*Darren Baxter (English footballer) (born 1981)"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Canadian Soccer League players", "response": ["* Darren Baxter \u2013 Oakville Blue Devils \u2013 2005"]}]}}
