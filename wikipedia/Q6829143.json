The character was portrayed by Michael Carter in Return of the Jedi, who was cast based upon his stage acting experience; the actor did not know it was a Star Wars film until after he accepted the role. Erik Bauersfeld provided the voice of Fortuna in Return of the Jedi, and sound editor Matthew Wood portrayed the character in The Phantom Menace and The Mandalorian.", "Fortuna is a powerful and dreaded individual in the galaxy's underground community, though also somewhat cowardly, and has a large capacity for cruelty and violence. His sadism is on display in Return of the Jedi, where he looks forward to seeing Luke Skywalker and his friends get fed to the sarlacc. Fortuna has a very vindictive personality, demonstrated by his attack against his home planet of Ryloth as an act of revenge for the death sentence he previously received there. He often resorts to underhanded means to achieve his objectives, acting out against friends and foes alike. This was exemplified by his willingness to kill one of his allies, the alien Nivek in Jabba the Hutt: Betrayal, when he risked exposing Fortuna's plot to assassinate Jabba. Fortuna is cunning and manipulative, illustrated by the way in which he presents himself to Jabba as meek and passive in order to achieve his goals. However, Skywalker's use of the Force to influence his mind in Return of the Jedi indicates Fortuna lacks a strong will, as Jedi mind tricks are more effective against weak-minded and susceptible individuals. Michael Carter, the actor who portrayed Bib Fortuna in Return of the Jedi, said he found the character \"stupid in an endearing way\" and \"quite innocent, yet quite scary\", and believed he could have led a good life if he had been raised in a different place.", "Bib Fortuna's costume in Return of the Jedi was designed by Rodis-Jamero and Aggie Guerard Rodgers, and Nick Dudman worked as a makeup artist on the character. Fortuna involved the first prosthetic makeup Dudman worked upon. Michael Carter, the actor who portrayed Fortuna, spent three months undergoing extensive makeup casts and tests for the character at Elstree Studios before shooting began. Molds were made from his hands and head. Several foam appliances were sculpted to conform to Carter's face, and molds were made and cast into foam latex, which were then trimmed and carefully glued to the actor's face. It took about eight-and-a-half hours to apply the makeup to Carter the first time, though the process was eventually reduced to slightly under an hour. Carter had been told a great deal of makeup would be involved with the part, but he said: \"I did not know what I was letting myself in for when it came to having to wear so much makeup. It did come as a bit of a shock.\"", "It took five weeks to film Bib Fortuna's scenes for Return of the Jedi. Michael Carter initially received little information about the character except that he was \"an alien, and not a very nice one\". Due to the secrecy surrounding the film, Carter was only given the script pages that included his specific scenes. He got them about four days before filming began, with all dialogue and information about other characters redacted. Since Fortuna's dialogue was in an alien language, and since he had little knowledge about the rest of the film, Carter did not know anything about the storyline of Return of the Jedi during the filming process. In order to realistically deliver dialogue in a fictional language, Carter would make up his own meaning for the words he was speaking, which made it easier for him to find the correct vocal delivery and facial expressions for the performance.", "===Michael Carter===", "The role of Bib Fortuna was cast very early in the production process for Return of the Jedi because makeup artist Stuart Freeborn wanted to get started on creating the character's look as quickly as possible. Michael Carter came to the attention of Return of the Jedi casting director Mary Selway saw him perform in a musical in the West End theatre section of London in the early 1980s. Director Richard Marquand had also seen and enjoyed Carter's theater work, and wanted to cast him as Fortuna; Marquand described him as a \"terrific actor\". He was also drawn to Carter for the role because he wanted Fortuna to be very tall, and Carter was about six feet tall.", "Bauersfeld did not receive an on-screen credit for his roles as Fortuna or Ackbar, and his association with the characters was unknown for years after the film was released. Michael Carter did not know another actor's voice was used, as late as 2004 he believed it was his own voice, saying in an interview: \"It sounded like my voice.\" Eventually fans learned Bauersfeld played the parts and he began to receive multiple fan letters every week, which continued for the rest of his life. Bauersfeld said he appreciated the passion of fans and responded to every autograph request, but that he was not particularly knowledgeable about Star Wars himself; in 2011 interview, he said he had not seen Return of the Jedi since it first came out, still had not seen the first Star Wars film, and knew no details about Fortuna, asking the interviewer: \"He was the bad guy, wasn't he?\"", "Fortuna was ranked No. 25 on Rolling Stone's list of the 50 best Star Wars characters, and was also included among The Daily Telegraph's list of the best characters from the franchise. CNET writer Sam Stone called Fortuna \"one of the most memorable\" characters and alien races from Return of the Jedi and described him as \"a fan-favorite character\". Star Wars Insider writer Calum Waddell described Bib Fortuna as \"one of the standout supporting characters\" of Return of the Jedi. Scott Chernoff of Star Wars Insider said Michael Carter conveyed \"a touching vulnerability through his makeup and contact lenses, transforming what could have been a stock character into a sadly haunting figure\".", "Fortuna's line \"De wanna wanga\", which he speaks upon first meeting C-3PO and R2-D2 in Return of the Jedi, has become a well-known line of Star Wars dialogue. Michael Carter has noted the character he portrayed became far more famous than the actor himself, joking: \"Bib Fortuna's very famous; I'm hardly known within my own family.\" Daniel Mallory Ortberg, an author and editor who has written a Star Wars short story for the anthology book From a Certain Point of View (2017), has said Tales from Jabba's Palace and reading the back story of Bib Fortuna and other characters was one of the first times the franchise strongly resonated with him.
