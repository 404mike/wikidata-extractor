He became interested in the manufacture of terracotta around 1839 when he engaged J. G. Bubb on experimental terracotta work for model cottages at Canford Magna, Dorset. This appears to have led to his manufacturing terracotta ornamentation for buildings. In the early 1840s he supplied an extensive series of gothic terracotta mouldings for the English church at Bagni di Lucca in Tuscany.  In the mid 1840s he started working with leading English sculptors, most notably John Bell and William Theed the Younger, for whom he produced terracotta versions of sculptures which were originally sculpted in marble or cast in iron.thumb|Garthmyl Hall Pediment showing terracotta including armorial and ornamented chimney stacks designed by J.K. Colling Blashfield was well connected and patronised by some of the leading architects, particularly the Wyatts, Sydney Smirke and Charles Barry Jr.\"Stratton\"1993, 66  Blashfield also derived many of his ideas for designs from the architects and illustrators  Owen Jones and  James Kellaway Colling.   As result of the popularity of terracotta pieces at the Great Exhibition of 1851, he turned increasingly towards the manufacture of garden furniture, parapets and urns. It has been claimed that at about this time he purchased the moulds from Eleanor Coade's Lambeth works that had been used to produce Coade Stone,Gunnis 1968, 56 but this has been disputed as Coade's bankruptcy was some years before and few of his designs resemble those of Coade, except for the shape of some of the urns.Kelly 1990, 51, 54, 223, 227, 313 The buff colour and texture of Blashfield's Terracotta can resemble the appearance of Coade stone. Blashfield's main works was in Millwall but he had showrooms at Praed Street adjacent to the Edgeware Road in Paddington.

The sculptures were later destroyed when the Crystal Palace was burnt down.  To publicise his terracottas  Blashfield published in 1855 An Account of the History and Manufacture of Ancient and Modern Terra Cotta  and several catalogues, including A Catalogue of Five Hundred Articles in 1857. These terracottas included replicas of classical statuary and vases, such as the Niobe group in the Uffizi and the Borghese and Medici vases. Blashfield was proud of the fact that his products were hand-finished and taken from the best moulds.Chris Hill History Kensington Palace Gardens: The Victorian Creation of an Elite Suburban Street ", "* 1854 Crystal Palace, Sydenham.
