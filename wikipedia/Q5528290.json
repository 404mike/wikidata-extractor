He died following an automobile accident in California.Trippe was a motorcycling journalist in the UK until he founded a motorcycling magazine, Motor Cycle Weekly, in the United States in 1969. In the early 1970s he brought European style motocross racing to the US by founding the Carlsbad USGP. Trippe was also the creator of supermoto racing, which attracted a large US television audience from 1979\u20131985, and had a resurgence, first in Europe and then beyond, since the early 2000s. Since 2007 Trippe worked to create a single cylinder racing class with low barriers to entry for amateur racers and young riders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Motocross", "response": ["Supermoto began in the US the late 1970s when TV journalist Gavin Trippe envisioned a racing event that would prove who the best motorcycle racer was. From 1980 to 1985, he organized a yearly event called \"The Superbikers\", which pitted the top riders from three disciplines, flat track, road racing, and motocross against one another on modified bikes raced on special tracks on the television show. Its first exposure to a wide audience came on the American television program ABC's Wide World of Sports in 1979. After 1985, the sport declined and received little exposure in the US, but in Europe, it started gaining popularity, and in 2003 it was revived in the US, when the name became Supermoto."]}, {"page": "Supermoto", "response": ["Supermoto is a form of motorcycle racing held on race tracks that alternate between three kinds of track surfaces: the hard packed dirt of flat track, the irregular jumps and obstacles of motocross, and  the paved tarmac of road racing. Supermoto was originally conceived by Gavin Trippe in 1979 as a segment of the TV show Wide World of Sports. It was something like an all-star game, in which the best riders from the three separate genres of motorcycle racing could temporarily leave their normal race class to come together and compete for the title of best all around racer. Today supermoto is a distinct genre of its own and riders in the other classes do not routinely cross over into supermoto.", "Supermoto has its origins in the 1970s when ABC\u2019s Wide World of Sports was the highest-rated sports show in the United States. In 1979, ABC commissioned a made-for-TV event called \"Superbikers,\" created by motorcycling journalist and promoter Gavin Trippe, intended to find the ultimate all-around motorcycle racer by putting all star riders from different genres of racing on a single track that combined three genres of racing: flat track racing, motocross and road racing. Superbikers was then manifested as a yearly event run at southern California's Carlsbad Raceway. The show's tarmac-and-dirt courses were intended to draw on talent from the worlds of off-road, flat track and road racing. World and National Championship-winning motorcycling greats such as Kenny Roberts and Jeff Ward, whose respective sports at the time were road-racing and motocross, participated in the races. The Superbikers quickly became a huge Nielsen ratings contender, running until 1985, at which point ABC was forced to cancel the show due to new management and cuts; its cancellation also initiated a long sabbatical of the sport in the USA."]}, {"page": "Trippe", "response": ["* Gavin Trippe (born 1940), English motorcycle racing promoter, journalist, and publisher"]}, {"page": "Super Single", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gavin Trippe"]}, {"page": "Supermono", "response": ["*Gavin Trippe#Formula 450 series"]}, {"page": "Supersingle", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gavin Trippe "]}, {"page": "Formula 450", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gavin Trippe#Formula 450 series"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2018", "response": ["*Gavin Trippe, 78, British motorcycle racing promoter and publisher.Gavin Trippe 1940\u20142018"]}]}}
