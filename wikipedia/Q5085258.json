These songs, recorded in New York City at the Axis Studios, Power Station and Whorga Musica, were the only tracks recorded outside the UK.;  Minogue said, \"I was feeling a bit like a ping-pong ball for a while, with the American and English both wanting different things.\" Minogue recorded a song entitled \"Intuition\" during these sessions, which was shelved until 2019, when Harry gave the demo to American singer Liz for her album Planet Y2K. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, better known as Pet Shop Boys, were approached by Minogue's camp after the pair finished work on Very (1993). They declined initially, but Lowe came up with a set of chords that Tennet found similar to Minogue's previous work with SAW and suggested they turn it into a song for her.;  The demo for \"Falling\" was sent to Deconstruction, where it was reworked by Fire Island, an English music duo made up of Pete Heller and Terry Farley. Tennet found the result very different from the original demo, saying, \"It doesn't really have the same tune in it, for instance, and they haven't put the chorus in, but I suppose that's very modern.\" Minogue's label mate M People produced \"Time Will Pass You By\" for Kylie Minogue but could not commit to do more because of a busy schedule.

She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them to make sure they were right. She explained, \"But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time \u2013 that's quite tricky!\" Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added \"the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!\"", "The Hollywood Reporter's Ray Bennett praised Northanger Abbey, calling it \"a wonderfully evocative version\", which was \"written with flair and imagination by Andrew Davies\". He proclaimed \"Capturing vividly the flush and wonder of adolescence, the film mines Austen's first-written but last-published novel to find purest nuggets of wit, romance and social satire. The story's 18th-century heroine, Catherine Morland, has a fevered imagination and Davies draws on Austen's droll illustrations of it to create scenes of gothic adventure.\" Bennett added \"the film is shot beautifully by Ciar\u00e1n Tanham while composer Charlie Mole's score adds to the quickening pace of Catherine's fantasies.\" For his work on Northanger Abbey, cinematographer Tanham was nominated for Best Director of Photography at the 5th Irish Film and Television Awards."]}, {"page": "65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards", "response": ["** Charlie Mole for Mr Selfridge (Episode: \"Episode 1\") (PBS)"]}, {"page": "Seven (Lisa Stansfield album)", "response": ["After releasing The Moment in 2004, Stansfield focused on acting.
