He made more than 250 appearances in the Football League for Birmingham City, Peterborough United and Walsall, and played in both legs of the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, which Birmingham lost to Roma. For Birmingham, he was used as Trevor Smith's deputy at centre half, and later replaced George Allen at left back.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Allen (footballer, born 1932)", "response": ["Allen was born in Small Heath, Birmingham. A strong-tackling left-back, he joined Coventry City as an amateur while in the army but made no first-team appearances. In November 1952, he joined Birmingham City on a free transfer, and made his league debut the following season on 19 April 1954 in a Second Division game against Nottingham Forest at St Andrew's which ended 2\u20132. The form of established full-back pairing Ken Green and Jeff Hall meant Allen was unable to establish himself as a regular in the side, making only 30 appearances in his first seven years at the club. When Green sustained the injury which eventually forced his retirement, Allen took his place and kept it until suffering a fractured skull in 1961. On his recovery, he could not regain his place, mainly due to the form of Graham Sissons. After almost ten years at the club, and 166 games in all competitions, he joined Torquay United in January 1962, following in the footsteps of Birmingham teammate Gordon Astall who had made the same move six months earlier."]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["|LB||3|| Graham Sissons", "|LB||3|| Graham Sissons"]}, {"page": "Sissons (surname)", "response": ["*Graham Sissons (born 1934), English footballer"]}]}}
