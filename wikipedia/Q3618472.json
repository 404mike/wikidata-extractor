During his career at the Victoria Ground he played in every outfield position, filling in as and when required. In his natural position he was a defensive midfielder, although he made most of his appearances in the back four. Never a flashy player, he won a Second Division winner's medal in 1962\u201363 and a League Cup runners-up medal in 1964. Against Leicester City in August 1971, Skeels broke his leg in a tackle with Steve Whitworth. He battled his way back to fitness in time to replace the injured Denis Smith for the League Cup semi-final against West Ham United, helping Stoke to reach the 1972 League Cup Final, where they beat Chelsea 2\u20131. Skeels established a club record for league appearances towards the end of the 1974\u201375 season, and with war-time fixtures considered unofficial he also lays claim to record appearance holder in all competitions with 597.

On 13 May 1967, Stoke City visited Old Trafford to play Manchester United, just after United had been confirmed as the old Division One champions. Paddy Crerand of United had an altercation with Peter Dobing of Stoke. Unknown to Partridge, TV cameras picked up Crerand's action of spitting over his shoulder at Tony Allen, another Stoke player. Partridge later received a letter from Alan Hardaker, the then secretary of the Football League, asking for his observations on the incident, but was unable to respond with conclusive evidence. Nevertheless, the International Board changed the Laws of the Game to put spitting on a par with violent conduct, and therefore a dismissible offence.
