The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, \"Du musst Caligari werden!\", or \"You must become Caligari!\" Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, \"It will be a horrible failure for all of us!\" As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggests the film was shelved \"for lack of a suitable outlet\", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane."]}, {"page": "1971 in literature", "response": ["*Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel \u2013 Hess: A Biography"]}, {"page": "Ca\u00efssa", "response": ["* When writing about chess, Heinrich Fraenkel used the pseudonym \"Assiac\", which is \"Ca\u00efssa\" spelled backwards."]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["Based on the book by Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel."]}, {"page": "Operation Himmler", "response": ["The plan, named after its originator, Heinrich Himmler,Roger Manvell, Heinrich Fraenkel, Heinrich Himmler: The SS, Gestapo, His Life and Career, Skyhorse Publishing Inc., 2007, , Google Print, p.76 was supervised by Reinhard Heydrich20 Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Volume 4; Thursday, 20 December 1945 .
