The bulk of his domestic cricketing career occurred with Worcestershire, although he had a spell with Derbyshire, and overseas with Natal. He played in nine Tests and twenty five ODIs for England, including participating in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Several websites, mistakenly, report that he is Ray Illingworth's son but the two are not related.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 23", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Richard Illingworth, English cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "1992 Cricket World Cup", "response": ["In a thrilling final, Pakistan beat England by 22 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Derek Pringle took two early wickets for England before Imran Khan and Javed Miandad added 139 for the third wicket to steady the Pakistan innings \u2013 although both were very slow to score early on, and Imran benefited from a dropped catch just as he was trying to increase the tempo, having up to that point scored only 9 in 16 overs. He went on to score 72. At the 25 over mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139 by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner, and he and Imran Khan built a steady partnership. During his innings, Imran hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members section. Imran played a captain's innings, getting a score of 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250.", "England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was dismissed for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Alec Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother caused Imran to give an early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote the fate of the match. Two deliveries from the left arm fast bowler dismissed Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's fate. Imran Khan had the final say, when he had Richard Illingworth caught by Ramiz Raja off his bowling to finish the final and crown Pakistan World Champions."]}, {"page": "ICC Awards", "response": ["| Richard Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Andrew Caddick", "response": ["thumb|left|150px|Caddick warming up prior to a one-day matchMaking his debut in the first ODI of the 1993 Texaco Trophy series at Old Trafford, after an average display with the ball in which he took 1/50, Caddick arrived at the crease with 11 runs required to win.  Four runs were added to the score prior to the final over, leaving Caddick and Richard Illingworth needing to score seven runs off the last over to secure the match for England.  A leg bye reduced the target, but they still needed six from the last two balls.  Facing the penultimate ball, Caddick stroked the ball to long leg and launched himself off for the single, turned and sprinted back for the second, only to find that Illingworth had remained in his crease.  Illingworth was run out, and England lost by four runs.  Caddick had no such excitement in the second ODI, as he was not required to bat, and failed to take any wickets on a batting track at Edgbaston.  With the series already lost, Caddick found more joy in the third ODI, taking three wickets and helping to restrict the Australians to 230; a total England must have felt they could chase down.  A batting collapse ensured that this would not be the case, and Australia took the series 3\u20130."]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1986: Richard Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Elite Panel of ICC Umpires", "response": ["!  scope=\"row\" | Richard Illingworth"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Richard Illingworth||||57||2012|| 2021", "*Three umpires were used for the 2nd Test between West Indies and New Zealand at Port of Spain in 2014.
