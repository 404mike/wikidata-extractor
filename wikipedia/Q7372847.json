In Cowan v Scargill[1985] Ch 270 the trustees of pensions represented by Arthur Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers wished the pension fund to invest more in the troubled UK mining industry, by excluding investments, for instance, in competing industries, while the trustees appointed by the employer did not. Megarry J held the action would violate a trustee's duty if this action was taken. Drawing a parallel of refusing to invest in South African companies (during Apartheid) he warned that \"the best interests of the beneficiaries are normally their best financial interests.\" Although this was thought in some quarters to preclude ethical investment, it was made clear in Harries v Church Commissioners for England that the terms of a trust deed may explicitly authorise or prohibit certain investments, that if the object of a trust is, for example, Christian charity then a trustee could plainly invest in \"Christian\" things.[1992] 1 WLR 1241. In Harries, Donald Nicholls VC held that unless financial performance could be proven to be harmed, a trustee for church clergy retirement could take ethical considerations into account when investing money, and so avoid investments contrary to the religion's principles. By analogy, a trade union pension trustee could refuse to invest in apartheid South Africa, while the government there suppressed unions.See the apartheid law, the Industrial Conciliation Act 1956, which required unions to be racially segregated, and under which strikes were illegal until the new Labour Relations Act 1995. cf, decided before Harries, the Scottish case of Martin v City of Edinburgh DC [1988] SLT 239 The government commissioned report by Roy Goode on Pension Law Reform confirmed the view that trustees may have an ethical investment policy and use their discretion in following it.R Goode, The Report of the Pension Law Review Committee (1993) Cmnd 2342, 349\u2013350 The modern approach in trust law is consistent with the UK company law duty of directors to pay regard to all stakeholders, not merely shareholders, in a company's management.Companies Act 2006 s 172 Trustees must simply invest according to general principles of the duty of care, and diversification.nb RA Brealey and SC Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance (3rd edn 1988) 156 state that investment in 20 companies realises 95% of the value of investing in a full stock market index listing, while investment in 100 companies realises 99% of the value of full index diversification.", "Although beneficiaries of a trust, or those owed fiduciary duties, will ordinarily wish to sue trustees first for breach of obligations, the trustee may have disappeared, or become insolvent, or perhaps the beneficiaries will desire to have a specific asset returned. In all these situations, the law allows a limited remedy if a person that received trust property is not \"equity's darling\": the \"bona fide purchaser\" of the asset.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 12, 341\u2013349 A bona fide purchaser of property, even if property is received after a breach of trust, has long been held to take free of any claims by prior owners, if they acted in good faith, committed no wrong, and they have paid for the property. When the value in assets is traced, this process is technically said to be \"genuinely neutral as to the rights\" a claimant may have.P Birks, 'The Necessity of a Unitary Law of Tracing' in Making Commercial Law, Essays in Honour of Roy Goode (1997) 239, 257, tracing is \"cleanly separated from the business of asserting rights in or in relation to assets successfully traced\", approved in Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29 Only if recipients have committed additional wrongs, through some form of negligence, knowledge or dishonesty, will they liable, with a good claim at the end of the tracing process. However, the law is unsettled on what is needed, and divides between a traditional common law or equity approach, on the one hand, and a more modern unjust enrichment and tort law analysis on the other hand. In all cases, however, the recipient must have received property for their \"own use and benefit\". This means that in cases where solicitors,See Barnes v Addy (1873\u201374) LR 9 Ch App 244 and potentially banks,Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265, 292, per Millett J, or other parties that merely act as conduits, that receive money simply to pass it onto someone else, they have not been regarded as a liable recipient."]}, {"page": "Statute of Bankrupts", "response": ["*Roy Goode, Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law, 3rd ed., para 1-05"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom insolvency law", "response": ["Especially as automatic crystallisation ceased to make floating charges an effective form of priority, the next step by businesses was to contract for fixed charges over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd[1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142 it was said to be done with a stipulation that the charge was \"fixed\" and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd[1994] 1 BCLC 485 the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However, the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd[2001] UKPC 28 the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both.[2001] UKPC 28, [46] In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd,[2005] UKHL 41 the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, any charge purported to be \"fixed\" over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition \"reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have.\"[2005] UKHL 41, [111] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring).J Armour, 'Should we redistribute in insolvency?' (2006) EGCI Working Paper On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, in the same way as was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.Roy Goode, 'Is the Law too Favourable to Secured Creditors?' (1983) 8 Canadian Business Law Journal 53, suggesting the law goes too far to promote secured creditors' interests over unsecured creditors. Riz Mokal, Corporate Insolvency Law: Theory and Application (OUP 2005) ch 6", "A comprehensive challenge to Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, and based on untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour.See also, E Warren and JL Westbrook, \u2018Contracting Out of Bankruptcy: An Empirical Intervention\u2019 (2005) 118 Harvard Law Review 1197, criticised using theoretical constructs without any attempt to verify by empirical evidence any of the premises. cf RK Rasmussen, \u2018Empirically Bankrupt\u2019 (2007) Col Bus LR 179, arguing that the empirically study was fundamentally flawed. Responded to in E Warren and JL Westbrook, \u2018The Dialogue Between Theoretical and Empirical Scholarship\u2019 U of Texas Law and Econ Research Paper, No 88; Harvard Public Law Working Paper No 137 First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest.E Warren, \u2018Bankruptcy Policy\u2019 (1987) 54 University of Chicago Law Review 775\u2013814, 777, \u2018I see bankruptcy as an attempt to reckon with a debtor\u2019s multiple defaults and to distribute the consequences among a number of different actors. Bankruptcy encompasses a number of competing \u2013 and sometimes conflicting \u2013 values in their distribution. As I see it, no one value dominates, so that bankruptcy policy becomes a composite of factors that bear on a better answer to the question, how shall the losses distributed?\u2019 Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up should be taken into account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good.(1987) 54 University of Chicago Law Review 775, 790\u2013791 The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to \"single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn good deal for secured creditors.\"(1987) 54 University of Chicago Law Review 775, 803 Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified negative externality against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement.LA Bebchuk and JM Fried, \u2018The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy\u2019 (1996) 105 Yale Law Journal 857\u2013934 In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The taking of security depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power.R Goode, Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law (2011) 2\u201318, 76\u201377 Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not know who they were at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.Riz Mokal, \u2018The Authentic Consent Model: Contractariansim, Creditors\u2019 Bargain, and Corporate Liquidation\u2019 (2001) 21 Legal Studies 400.
