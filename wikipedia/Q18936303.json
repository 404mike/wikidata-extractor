Born in rural Scotland and educated at the University of Edinburgh, he spent nearly all his career at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, where he created the plant pathology research school in the 1920s, becoming Britain's first professor of plant pathology in 1928, and heading the department of botany (1938\u201353). He was president of the Association of Applied Biologists and the British Mycological Society. He studied Botrytis cinerea, which causes grey mould in a variety of plants, and various Fusarium species that attack apples.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Brown", "response": ["William Brown

In 1932, after taking a course by the mycologist William Brown, she shifted her focus to fungal physiology. Around this time, Walter Buddin at Reading also interested her (and Terence Ingold) in collecting fungi in the wild, a lifelong pursuit. Hawker joined Brown's group at the botany department of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London that year, becoming a research assistant (1933), and rising to demonstrator (1934) and assistant lecturer in mycology and pathology (1937). Her research work was acknowledged in the award of PhD (1935) and DSc degrees (1944) from the University of London. Her career was interrupted by the Second World War; she remained at Imperial's London site teaching under difficult conditions, while Brown and others from the department moved to Slough. Michael J. Carlile comments on her relatively slow promotion at Imperial, despite being highly active in both research and teaching, speculating that it might have been due to her not having contacts."]}, {"page": "W.Br.", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Brown (plant pathologist)"]}]}}
