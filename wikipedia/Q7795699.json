At the Battle of Loos in 1915, Capper was shot by a sniper as he reconnoitred the front line during an assault by his division on German positions. He died the next day in a casualty clearing station from wounds to both lungs; his grave is in the nearby Lillers Communal Cemetery.\nCapper was an active and vigorous soldier who had been wounded just six months before his death in an accidental grenade detonation. Shortly before this wound he had been knighted by King George V for his service in command of his division during the First Battle of Ypres. Field Marshal Sir John French commented upon his death that \"he was a most distinguished and capable leader and his death will be severely felt.\" He was also a keen military historian and his collected papers are currently stored at the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
