They were married in Wales in April 1921. In 1927 he inherited a small estate in Scotland from his uncle William Marshall, on condition that he should assume the surname of Marshall. As Marshall was one of his forenames, this was achieved by the insertion of a hyphen. The Marshall-Cornwalls had a son and two daughters. Their elder daughter died aged fourteen in 1938 after an operation for appendicitis in Switzerland. Their son was killed in France in 1944. He is buried on the spot where he fell, in an orchard near Cahaignes, Normandy. After the war, the landowner presented the site of the grave to the casualty's father, who in turn, requested that the grave remain undisturbed. His other daughter Janet married Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton on 14 October 1947."]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton, peer (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2011", "response": ["*Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton, 90, British aristocrat and politician."]}, {"page": "Michael Willoughby", "response": ["* Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton, British peer"]}]}}
