While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism, attending the inaugural session of the Essex Street Chapel, at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act."]}, {"page": "Christadelphians", "response": ["Organised worship in England for those whose beliefs anticipated those of Christadelphians only truly became possible in 1779 when the Act of Toleration 1689 was amended to permit denial of the Trinity, and only fully when property penalties were removed in the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. This is only 35 years before John Thomas' 1849 lecture tour in Britain which attracted significant support from an existing non-Trinitarian Adventist base, particularly, initially, in Scotland where Arian, Socinian, and unitarian (with a small 'u' as distinct from the Unitarian Church of Theophilus Lindsey) views were prevalent."]}, {"page": "Unitarian Universalism", "response": ["Influenced by the teachings of the Polish Socinians, Samuel Clarke (1675\u20131729) revised the Book of Common Prayer, removing the Trinitarian Nicene Creed and references to Jesus as God.

Neither cleric was charged under the Blasphemy Act 1697 that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity\". The Act of Toleration (1689) gave relief to English Dissenters, but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the Church of England.

On the Sunday following the registration\u2014April 17, 1774\u2014the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel. In attendance were Lee, Joseph Priestley and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony, Benjamin Franklin.

In the 17th century, significant repression in Poland led many Unitarians to flee or be killed for their faith, notably Katarzyna Weiglowa. From the 16th to 18th centuries, Unitarians in Britain often faced significant political persecution, including John Biddle, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Theophilus Lindsey. In England, the first Unitarian Church was established in 1774 on Essex Street, London, where today's British Unitarian headquarters is still located.Erwin Fahlbusch The encyclopedia of Christianity 5 603 2008 \"Lindsey attempted but failed to gain legal relief for Anglican Unitarians, so in 1774 he opened his own distinctly Unitarian church on Essex Street, London, where today's British Unitarian headquarters are still located.\"", "The word Unitarian had been circulating in private letters in England, in reference to imported copies of such publications as the Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians (1665). Henry Hedworth was the first to use the word \"Unitarian\" in print in English (1673), and the word first appears in a title in Stephen Nye's A brief history of the Unitarians, called also Socinians (1687). The movement gained popularity in England in the wake of the Enlightenment and began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when Theophilus Lindsey organised meetings with Joseph Priestley, founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country.

Having influenced the Polish Brethren to a formal declaration of this belief in the Racovian Catechism, Fausto Sozzini involuntarily ended up giving his name to this Christological position, which continued with English Unitarians such as John Biddle, Thomas Belsham, Theophilus Lindsey, Joseph Priestley, and James Martineau.

When the college faced bankruptcy with debts of two thousand pounds because of over-expansion and poor supervision of the builders, he dashed to London to add his support, chairing a subcommittee appointed to 'reduce household expenses.'John Rylands Library, MSS collection of Lindsey letters in three volumes: Lindsey to William Tayleur, 21 May 1791 and 7 June 1791. Dr. Williams's Trust: Hackney College Minute Book, 1785-91, ff 135, 150. In 1790, he backed Priestley's scheme for a Birmingham Sunday Society, where youngsters who had passed through a basic Sunday school were taught arithmetic, book-keeping, geography and drawing, as well as the elements of natural and revealed religion, by teachers drawn from Priestley's Senior Class.J. Money, Experience and Identity, Manchester University Press, 1977,  pp. 142, 220. As well as a major subscriber to the Unitarian New Meeting in Birmingham, acting as Secretary to the committee of subscribers from 1771 to 1793,Russell's family had been members of the New Meeting, since its foundation in 1692, when Russell's great-grandfather worshipped in what was then called the Lower Meeting. When a new chapel was built in the late 1720s, in Moor Street, Russell's grandfather was one of thirty-two original trustees: Herbert New, The New Meeting and Church of the Messiah, Birmingham, 1912. Russell subscribed to a host of chapels up and down the country, including Theophilus Lindsey's Essex Street Chapel, and supported a number of dissenting ministers."]}, {"page": "Francis Blackburne (priest)", "response": ["In 1772 a meeting was held at the Feathers Tavern, and a petition signed by 200 persons for giving effect to Blackburne's proposal in The Confessional. It was rejected by 217 to 71 after a speech in condemnation by Edmund Burke, published in his Works.Theophilus Lindsey, who married a stepdaughter of Blackburne's, and John Disney, who married his eldest daughter, joined in this agitation, and both of them later left the church of England to become Unitarians. Blackburne was said to sympathise with their views, to have declined an offer to succeed the nonconformist Samuel Chandler at the Old Jewry meeting house at a salary of \u00a3400."]}, {"page": "John Disney (Unitarian)", "response": ["Disney became an active member of the association formed on 17 July 1771 to promote a petition to parliament for relief of the clergy from subscription. The petition was rejected by the House of Commons on 6 February 1772. Disney did not immediately follow the example of his friend Theophilus Lindsey, who resigned his benefice in the following year. On his way to London in December 1773, Lindsey stayed for more than a week at Swinderby. Like some others, Disney accommodated the public service to suit his special views. He had always ignored the Athanasian Creed; he now omitted the Nicene Creed and the Litany, and made other changes in reading the common prayer. On 5 June 1775 the University of Edinburgh made him D.D., through the influence of Bishop Law with Principal William Robertson; in 1778 he was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. For a time Disney concentrated on secular duties and political action. He was an energetic magistrate, and while staying at Flintham Hall, near Newark, the seat of his eldest brother Lewis Disney, he joined in 1780 the Nottingham county committee for retrenchment and parliamentary reform."]}, {"page": "John Lee (Attorney-General)", "response": ["By family background in Leeds, Lee was associated with Mill Hill Chapel, which was de facto Unitarian. His own views were influenced by his friend Priestley. He met Theophilus Lindsey through Priestley and William Turner of Wakefield, in the late 1760s. He was a sympathetic adviser to the promoters of the Feathers Tavern petition of 1772 to Parliament, asking for lifting of restrictions on religious dissenters.", "A leading figure in the petition was Theophilus Lindsey, a priest of the Church of England, who in 1773 resigned his Yorkshire living because of religious scruples of conscience, a step against Lee's wishes because the chances were his replacement would be High Church or an evangelical, rather than a liberal. In 1774 Lee helped Lindsey establish the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England. It was Lord Shelburne, a financial backer, who directed Lee, and Sir George Saville, towards Lindsey's Unitarians.Duncan Wu, William Hazlitt (1737\u20131820), the Priestley Circle, and \"The Theological Repository:\" A Brief Survey and Bibliography, The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (November 2005), pp. 758\u2013766, at p. 763. Published by: Oxford University Press  Before the 1813 Act it was illegal to deny the doctrine of the Trinity, but the temper of the times allowed for some latitude. Lee persuaded the relevant London justices to register the Essex Street Chapel at Hicks Hall, and attended Lindsey's inaugural sermon.chapter 2 The History of Essex Hall by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D. Lindsey Press, 1959  In 1775, Lee, Lindsey and his wife and Priestley were meeting regularly on Sunday mornings."]}]}}
