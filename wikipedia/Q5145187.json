He got a scholarship to grammar school, and then worked as a librarian and a teacher. He had been interested in birds since childhood, and joined an expedition to study autumn migration in Norway. He became a professional ornithologist at the age of 34 and became responsible for the care of the national collection of birds' nests and eggs in the Bird Room at the Natural History Museum at Tring, Hertfordshire.  In 1966 he led the fourth of the series of Harold Hall Australian ornithological collecting expeditions.\nHarrison later became interested in biogeography and the museum's avian paleontological collection, on which he published a number of articles with Cyril Walker.  He studied and published on different aspects of bird behaviour, on plumage patterns, and on the bone structure of modern and fossil birds. He identified Eostrix vincenti in 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*Colin Harrison \u2013 England"]}, {"page": "Crested lark", "response": ["The crested lark was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It was classified in the genus Alauda until German naturalist Friedrich Boie placed it in the new genus Galerida in 1821. Colin Harrison recommended lumping members of Galerida and Lullula back into Alauda in 1865 due to a lack of defining characteristics. The current scientific name is derived from Latin. Galerida was the name for a lark with a crest, from galerum, \"cap\", and cristata means \"crested\" Alban Guillaumet and colleagues noted the distinctiveness of populations from the Maghreb - birds in the dryer parts of Morocco and Tunisia had longer bills while those in more coastal northern parts had shorter bills typical of the European subspecies. The authors sampled the mitochondrial DNA and found they were distinct genetically."]}, {"page": "African silverbill", "response": ["In early literature, the African silverbill (Euodice cantans) and the Indian silverbill (E. malabarica) were treated as conspecific. In 1943, Jean Th\u00e9odore Delacour firmly united both species in his revision of the Estrildinae. However, in 1964, Colin Harrison first studied the two in a strictly comparative manner and concluded that they were two separate species. He discovered that although the call notes were similar, the songs are distinctly different in form, but sharing a common pattern. They are sympatric in the south of the Arabian Peninsula and there is no record of natural hybridization. From Harrison's personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. A molecular phylogenetic study of the Estrildidae published in 2020 found that the African and Indian silverbills were sister species that had diverged around one million years ago. The two species formed a clade that was basal to members of the genus Lonchura."]}, {"page": "2003 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["* ? - Colin Harrison"]}, {"page": "Bradycneme", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Colin Harrison"]}, {"page": "Wyleyia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Colin Harrison"]}, {"page": "Heptasteornis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Colin Harrison"]}, {"page": "Precursor (bird)", "response": ["\"Precursor\" is a controversial prehistoric bird genus from the Early Eocene.

The original material comprised the cranial part of a left scapula and a nearly complete left femur.  The lectotype femur was thought by Michel Brunet in 1970 to be typical of a pelican.  However, Colin Harrison in 1979 considered that it belonged to the Sulidae, and Storrs Olson in 1995 thought it might be a pelagornithid.
