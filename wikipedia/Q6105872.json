With the support of Municipal Reform Councillors, Moses narrowly defeated Labour's J. H. Hall to be elected as the first female Mayor of Stepney, and the first female Jewish mayor in the country. Labour opponents questioned her personal integrity, with some describing her as \"Shylock\" following her election."]}]}}
