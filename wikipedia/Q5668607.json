An inside forward, he attracted the attention of the Small Heath club, whose scout went to watch him playing for Singer's; they signed him, together with his more impressive teammate Frank Mobley, who went on to score 64 goals in four seasons for Small Heath. Edwards played in the first five games of the 1892\u201393 season \u2013 Small Heath's first season in the Football League \u2013 and scored on his debut, in a 5\u20131 defeat of Port Vale, but could not compete with Billy Walton and the prolific Fred Wheldon. He played for Leicester Fosse in the Midland League and for Derby County, without appearing in their Football League side, before moving to Southern League club Wolverton L&NWR. Edwards settled well at Wolverton, playing as an attacking centre half, and stayed for three seasons before moving to fellow Southern League club Watford.Edwards' younger brother Bill was also a professional footballer who played for Small Heath.Edwards died in his native Coventry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Edwards", "response": ["Harry Edwards may refer to:", "* Harry Edwards (Australian footballer) (born 2001), Australian rules footballer ", "* Harry Edwards (director) (1889\u20131952), Canadian-born American director/writer at Columbia Pictures", "* Harry Edwards (English footballer) (1870\u2013after 1899), English association footballer of the 1890s", "* Harry Edwards (healer) (1893\u20131976), spiritual healer", "* Harry Edwards (politician) (1927\u20132012), Australian politician", "* Harry Edwards (sociologist) (born 1942), American professor, author, and civil rights activist", "* Harry Edwards (trade unionist) (1874-1958), British trade union activist"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["All the regular first-team members during the previous season \u2013 goalkeepers Chris Charsley and George Hollis, backs Tom Bayley and Fred Speller, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Harry Morris, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon \u2013 remained with the club.

Both clubs fielded full first teams, Small Heath missing only Walton, for whom Harry Edwards proved a \"very indifferent\" substitute. In front of 15,000 spectators at Aston Lower Grounds, Small Heath outplayed their First Division opponents for the first half-hour, and had several chances which they failed to take, but Aston Villa improved thereafter, winning 5\u20130 after a quite one-sided second half.", "Unable to dislodge Wheldon or Billy Walton from the inside forward position, Harry Edwards chose to leave at the end of the season. Tom Bayley was released, and Fred Jones left for Lincoln City after losing his place at left back to Bernard Pumfrey. Harry Morris retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 71, 78, 85, 102, 112, 142."]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71.
