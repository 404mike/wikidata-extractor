Watson was the first openly lesbian parliamentarian in Australia and she played a significant role in lesbian and gay law reform in Western Australia. Her parliamentary career also included an active role in the achievement of abortion law reform in Western Australia. Watson's activism in the causes of gay and lesbian rights, social justice, indigenous rights, and peace and environmentalism, together with her parliamentary service made a major contribution to civil and human rights in Western Australia.  Her service and contributions were recognised in 2011 when she was inducted into the Western Australian Women's Hall of Fame. Watson campaigned in parliament on a number of issues, including the banning of uranium mining and radioactive waste disposal in Western Australia.
