After her husband went bankrupt in 1828, Fry's brother became her business manager and benefactor. Thanks to him, her work went on and expanded. Later, in 1838, the Friends sent a party to France. Fry and her husband, as well as Lydia Irving, and abolitionists Josiah Forster and William Allen were among the people sent. They were there on other business but despite the language barrier, Fry and Lydia Irving visited French prisons.Amanda Phillips, 'Irving, Lydia (1797\u20131893)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 June 2017 In 1840 Fry opened a training school for nurses.

The King of Prussia, who had met the social reformer during her previous tours of the continent promoting welfare change and humanitarianism, was so impressed by her work that he told his reluctant courtiers that he would personally visit the gaol when he was in London.", "Prompted by a family friend, Stephen Grellet, Fry visited Newgate Prison in 1813. The conditions she saw there horrified her.\"Elizabeth Fry\", Quakers in the World Newgate prison was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. The prisoners did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw. Newgate was also the last stop for many before being deported to Australia in ships Fry described as little better than slave ships (1814 ie 20 years before the abolition of slavery in 1833). The death penalty was common for even minor offences, initially giving what comfort she could to those facing death, Fry worked to get death sentences commuted to deportation to Australia. When she discovered female deportees were transported to the docks in open carts, she lobbied the authorities for closed dignified transport and accompanied those transports to the docks to ensure these prisoners (women and girls) felt supported. When a clergyman wrote to her from New South Wales telling her female deportees were delivered to Botany Bay and left to fend for themselves, she took this up with the authorities and ensured that not only were female barracks built in Parramatta but also that appropriate transportation by boat for the 16 miles from Botany Bay to Parramatta was in place. This friend Stephen Grellet and William Allen, another Quaker met the Emperor Alexander I in London in 1814 and travelled to the Russian Empire in 1818, a journey that involved much visiting of prisons and prevailing upon the prison governors for ameliorations, backed by a letter from Emperor Alexander I commanding his subjects to take very seriously what these English Quakers requested of them. In at least one location this involved the sex segregation of a prison in which rape and all other sexual exploitation of both women and girls was rife in the communal prison cells of this time. This is amply documented in the journals of both Stephen Grellet and William Allen, as is their work with Elizabeth Fry, who even saw them off at the docks on their journey through the Russian Empire from autumn of 1818, where they remained until March 1819 in St Petersburg, leaving for Moscow and travelling through the empire until they departed from Odessa in July 1819.
