He nonetheless led a crackdown against homosexuals in the UK in the 1950s. As Home Secretary he refused to commute Derek Bentley's death sentence for murder of a police officer: Bentley was hanged. His political ambitions were ultimately dashed in Harold Macmillan's cabinet reshuffle of July 1962.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1900", "response": ["* May 29 \u2013 David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir, British politician, lawyer and judge (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "1967", "response": ["** David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir, British politician, lawyer, and judge (b. 1900)"]}]}}
