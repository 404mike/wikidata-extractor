Haking is remembered chiefly for the high casualties suffered by his forces (including many Australian troops) at the second Battle of Fromelles, launched while the Battle of the Somme was underway 80 km to the south, although at least one British historian has sought to defend his reputation, regarding him as an \"intelligent and capable man\" unfairly maligned in the popular mythology of the war. Although blocked from further promotion he continued to command XI Corps \u2013 including in Italy in the winter of 1917\u201318 and in Flanders in April 1918 \u2013 until the end of the war.\nHe was the League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig in the early 1920s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 1914\u20131915 Major-General Richard Haking"]}, {"page": "Battle of Loos", "response": ["French decided to keep a reserve consisting of the Cavalry Corps, the Indian Cavalry Corps and XI Corps (Lieutenant-General Richard Haking), which consisted of the Guards Division and the New Army 21st Division and 24th Division, recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). Archibald Murray, the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff (DCIGS) advised French that as troops fresh from training, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare.
