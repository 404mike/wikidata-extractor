Thereafter, it became a destination for those seeking the picturesque, and is featured in most later guide books of the area. J.M.W. Turner visited the cave in 1808, and made a number of sketches and painted a view from the bottom, and in 1816 he returned when he painted the view from the top when the river was in spate. In 1818, William Westall produced a book of aquatinted engraved views of Yorkshire which included five views of Weathercote Cave. In 1835, Wordsworth described it as a \"fine object\".

It is marked on Thomas Jefferys 1771 map of Yorkshire, and it was drawn to the public's attention in 1780 by John Hutton in an appendix to Thomas West's \"A Guide to the Lakes\".  He described stopping at Thornton at the bottom of the dale \"to procure a guide, candle, tinderbox etc\", and he also noted inscriptions \"above two hundred years old\". By this time the features in the cave had all already acquired the names by which they are known today. Hutton's guide recounted the tale that about fifty years earlier, a pregnant woman travelling alone was taken in labour, and died in the cave. After the publication of Hutton's description, it became a destination for those seeking the picturesque, and is featured in most later guide books of the area, and is often described in magazines. William Wordsworth visited the cave in 1800, and later referred to it in The Prelude, and J. M. W. Turner sketched its exterior and interior in 1816. In July 1817 a devastating flood filled much of the chamber with debris. The guide of the time removed some to expose the stream once more, but much of the height of the chamber was lost. In 1818, William Westall produced a book of aquatinted engraved views of Yorkshire which included three views of Yordas Cave. It was still a showcave when Balderstone visited in around 1890. He had to apply to Braida Garth, the farmhouse  down the dale, for the key and a guide and was charged two shillings. The first through trip from the entrance in the upper gorge was made in 1925 by a Yorkshire Ramblers' Club party, accompanied by author Laurence Geoghegan who apparently made full use of the experience when writing his novel The Subterranean Club. The Back Door Entrance was opened up by members of the Northern Cavern and Fell Club in August 1932, when they referred to it as Scotsman's Entrance.
