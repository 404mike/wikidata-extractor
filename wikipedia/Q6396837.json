In August 2021, Southend revealed their overall debt in July 2019 was \u00a317.4m, having grown by \u00a32.4m; Martin said the majority of the debt was owed to his companies, and that \u00a36.8m of debt had already been written off. On 21 August 2021, Southend started their first season in the National League with a 1\u20130 victory at King's Lynn Town, but a six-match winless streak had manager Phil Brown fearing for his future, describing Southend as stuck in a massive \"chasm\". On 5 and 9 October 2021, Southend fans staged protests at Roots Hall demanding the departure of chairman Ron Martin; following a 4\u20130 defeat by Chesterfield at Roots Hall on 9 October, Brown was sacked. Collymore offered further free support to the club, described by the BBC as \"a mess\" and \"already on life support\". Defender Jason Demetriou took temporary charge before, on 20 October 2021, Kevin Maher returned to the club as head coach, supported by assistant Darren Currie and Mark Bentley as first team coach. CEO Tom Lawrence also started negotiations with Collymore about a formal role with the club, and he was appointed the club's senior football strategist in early November 2021, with John Still appointed head of football two weeks later. In December 2021, Southend was placed under a National League embargo because of HMRC debts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; after back-to-back relegations and 18 months of reduced income, CEO Lawrence said the club was \"in a deteriorating income position\".", "|2000\u201301||Kevin Maher", "|2006\u201307||Kevin Maher", "|2021\u2013||Kevin Maher", "|Head coach|| Kevin Maher", "*Most Appearances (Other Cup): Kevin Maher (26\u00a0\u2013 1998 to 2008)"]}, {"page": "Darren Currie", "response": ["On 20 October 2021, Currie joined National League side Southend United in the role of Assistant Head Coach to Kevin Maher."]}]}}
