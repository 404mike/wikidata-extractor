He attended Wellington College and then, using his family connections as a great-nephew of James Joseph Sylvester, he was able to secure a place at New College, Oxford reserved for students intending to pursue a career in the Indian Civil Service. In 1887, the same year that he matriculated at New College, he was appointed to the Indian Civil Service (ICS) upon passing the competitive examination. He arrived in India on 1 December 1889.Initially appointed in Bombay as an Assistant District collector and Assistant Magistrate, as well as an Inspector of Factories, by June 1896 Enthoven was promoted to Second Assistant. From 1900 until 1902 he served as First Assistant and Under-Secretary, being a Provincial Superintendent in Bombay for the 1901 census of India. Thereafter he was appointed to superintend the revision of the Imperial Gazetteer and was Director-General of Statistics. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1904.Enthoven was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire on 1 January 1910, at which time he was Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General, Educational, Marine, and Ecclesiastical Departments.Enthoven had contributed the General Index to the 34 volumes of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency that had been compiled by Sir James M. Campbell. In his later Tribes and Castes of Bombay, Enthoven placed much reliance on the work of Campbell, which Crispin Bates has described as being \"compendious but unsystematic ethnographic researches\". Kumar Suresh Singh has noted that the survey, conducted between 1901 and 1909, suffered from a shortage of funding, relied on amateur data collectors and used content from Campbell's Gazetteer without acknowledgement, thus leading to claims of plagiarism.In retirement and living at Vale House, Wootton, Berkshire by 1935, Enthoven was an Ordinary Member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society and also one of its Honorary Auditors. He had been a member of the Society since 1907.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kanhoji Angre", "response": ["Historian Sen believes that Angre's origin is \"obscure and he certainly did not belong to the nobility of the land\". Citation of the Arquivo Hist\u00f3rico Ultramarino (historical archives of the Portuguese empire) is given to show that Kanhoji started his life as a humble servant of some Hindus in the island of Versova. According to the family history, he was a \"Kshatriya\" Maratha. According to Reginald Edward Enthoven, Kanhoji had east African ancestry. Historian V. G. Dighe, in 1951, cites G. S. Sardesai's Selections from the Peshwa Daftar, and calls them \"blue-blood Marathas\" who \"would spurn to marry in families lower than those of Deshmukhs, Jadhavs, Jagtaps and Shitoles.\" However, S.R.Sharma seems to agree with the Portuguese opinions and believe him to have been a \"Maratha Koli captain\". Historian Dr.Arunchandra Pathak, in 2007, has published details from earlier records of Kolaba districts which he considers \"authentic and useful information on several aspects of the district and is considered to be of great value to administrators, scholars and general readers\" and K.K.Choudhari in the late 20th century also consider it authentic.  According to these records, Mr. Grose, a Bombay Civil Service Officer, who was a well-informed writer and was well acquainted with the country, and took special interest in matters connected with the Hindu religion and with Hindu castes has given information on Kanhoji's heritage. According to the editors, \"The unlikeliness of the story is a strong argument in favour of its truth\". Grose writes that Tukaji was an African Muslim who was born in the Gulf of Ormuz and in 1643 was shipwrecked near Cheul. He helped Shahji in the war with the Moghals and married the daughter of Shahji's minister, and their son Parab was the father of Kanhoji. This is an example of foreign warriors being admitted into the Hindu fold and marrying Hindu wives and other such examples are given in the chapter on Thana History."]}, {"page": "Belagavi district", "response": ["* Belgaum district gazetteer (1905) by Reginald Edward Enthoven"]}, {"page": "Arta (Kamuia)", "response": ["Scholars state that Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio of the Lion Capital Inscriptions is the same as Kshatrapa Kharaosta, whose coins have been studied by Dr Rapson and Dr Luders.
