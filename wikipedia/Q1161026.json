He wrote extensively on the history of Burma. His most notable work is A History of Southeast Asia, said to \"...remain the most important single history of the region, providing  encyclopedic coverage of material published up to the time of its 1981 revision.\" He held professorships in Southeast Asian history at both Cornell University and the University of London \u2013 where he eventually became professor emeritus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "U Thant", "response": ["After the death of his father, Thant believed he would not be able to complete a four-year degree and instead worked for a two-year teaching certificate at Rangoon University in 1926. As the eldest son he had to fulfill his filial duties and responsibilities to the family. At university, Thant, together with Nu, the future Prime Minister of Burma, studied history under D. G. E. Hall. Nu was told by a distant mutual relative to take care of Thant and the two soon became close friends. Thant was elected joint secretary of the University Philosophical Association and secretary of the Literary and Debating Society. In Rangoon, Thant met J.S. Furnivall, the founder of The Burma Book Club and The World of Books magazine, to which Thant regularly contributed. Promising a good post, Furnivall urged Thant to complete a four-year university course and join the Civil Service, but Thant refused. After earning the certificate, he returned to Pantanaw to teach at the National High School as a senior teacher in 1928. He contacted Furnivall and Nu regularly, writing articles and participating in The World of Books translation competitions."]}, {"page": "Pyay", "response": ["Much debate surrounds the construction of Sri Ksetra.
