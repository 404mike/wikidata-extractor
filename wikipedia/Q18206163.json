It took place at Holborn Stadium in May 1932 and Petersen beat Harry Crossley on points over 15 rounds to take his title. He later relinquished this title without defending it. Two months later, in July 1932, Petersen fought Reggie Meen for his British heavyweight title, in a bout held at Wimbledon Stadium, London. He knocked Meen out in the second round, becoming the first Welshman to be British heavyweight champion. He had accomplished this in a career lasting less than ten months.", "Petersen resumed his winning ways, winning his next 4 fights on knockouts.

Milligan was knocked out in the first round, but Moody would lose his newly recaptured title just three weeks later when he was defeated by Alexander Ireland. That was Moody's final fight of 1928, and in 1929 he fought just four times, which included a win over Italy's Leone Jacovacci, a loss to the great Len Harvey and then losing his British Light Heavyweight title to Harry Crossley."]}, {"page": "Len Johnson (boxer)", "response": ["On 22 March 1929, The Leeds Mercury reported that Johnson's next engagement would be with Belgian light-heavyweight Gerard Debarbieux at Liverpool on 1 April, while the newspaper noted that Johnson could be a likely opponent for Harry Crossley. On 6 May, the match arranged for 3 June in Leeds, between Johnson and Crossley, meant that the Northern light-heavyweight title was at stake, with the contract specifying for the men weighing in at 175 pouds. At the weigh in, Debarbieux weighed in at 175 pounds (79.4\u00a0kg), while Johnson came in lighter at 168 pounds (76.2\u00a0kg). Johnson won the fight with a fusillade of left-hands which continually troubled Debarbieux, who retired in the ninth-round with a damaged hand. In his preparation for Crossley, Johnson had gone to Upwell, near Wisbech, to do his training, as he realised the importance of the fight and that Crossley was a formidable rival, while there were rumours that Fred Shaw would be Johnson's chief sparring partner.", "After defeating Moret, Johnson vacated the Northern Area light-heavyweight title, which was later contested by Harry Crossley and Frank Fowler on 29 June at National Sporting Club in Leeds.", "In September 1930, Tommy Richie, boxing promoter, attempted to secure a match with Johnson and Harry Crossley for a gold belt, purse and the light-heavyweight championship of Britain. Lancashire Evening Post stated that \"If [Richie] succeeds it will be one of the most important fights of the year in the North\", though highlighted the apparent difficulty in obtaining Johnson's signature. On 1 September, Richie sent a telegram to William Johnson, Len's father and manager, inviting Len to fight Crossley in Preston, though the reply was met with the fact Johnson shall not be entering into any more boxing contracts. In October 1930, negotiations were confirmed in progress for a fight between Johnson and American Dave Shade at Manchester, with Johnson recently altering his decision to retire, and being eagar to face Shade.", "On 2 January 1931, The Leicester Evening Mail exclusively announced that Larry Gains had a scheduled meeting with Sam Russell of the National Sporting Club, with a view of removing the colour bar in British boxing, to which Gains stated, \"[...] It will mean that Johnson will be able to fight Harry Crossley for the Londsale cruiserweight belt [...] You can guess what the lifting of the ban would mean to me.\" As of 5 February, the National Sporting Club had scrapped the rule prohibiting coloured boxers on their programmes, and it was hoped that some amends would be made to Johnson. On 25 February, The Western Morning News announced that Johnson had signed up for three matches in Manchester, with the Belle Vue Syndicate proposing to match him with Harry Crossley and Len Harvey, light-heavyweight and middleweight champions, respectively. On 27 March, Northampton Chronicle & Echo reported that Johnson would appear at King's Hall, Manchester on 6 April, in a match at light-heavyweight against Jack Etienne, who was regarded as one of the best light-heavyweights in Europe. Leading up to the fight, Johnson was the major betting-line favourite, though on 6 April, Etienne narrowly outpointed him over fifteen-rounds at King's Hall, Manchester. Johnson was particularly keen to win the rubber-match with Etienne in view of the possibilities of a rematch with Len Harvey. Johnson started off well, and in the earlier rounds had a slight lead, but Etienne was always the stronger of the two. The Belgian fighter launched a fierce two-handed attack from the start and found frequent loopholes in Johnson's defence. During the post-fight interviews, Bill Johnson, father and manager of Len, remarked that his son had won the fight, in which he expanded: \"[...] the referee thought otherwise. That is all there is to that. The boys meet again on Monday next, and if Etienne's party think that the Belgian can confirm what the referee thought: I have \u00a3100 ready to place on the table to say he can't [...]\" The rematch was set for two-weeks later on 21 April, for \u00a350 a-side.", "By January 1933, Johnson had managed a variety of fighters including welterweight Tommy Kenny and heavyweight Bert Ikin. By April 1933, he challenged Jack Kid Casey, the Northern Area middleweight champion, to a contest. By May 1933, Johnson had decided to return as a boxer, with rumours of his possible opponent being Harry Crossley. On 18 May, it was revealed that Johnson would return to light-heavyweight to face Kid Scott, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Johnny Cuthbert, while having thoughts at possibly challenging for a light-heavyweight title in the future. In front of a crowd of 10,000 at Hyde Park, Sheffield, Johnson lost a narrow points-decision to Scott. Early in the bout, Scott had difficulty in penetrating Johnson's defence, and ultimately Scott's youth and strength served him well, and later he used a left hand effectively.", "* The Sheffield Telegraph proclaimed that \"[Johnson] is undoubtedly one of the best boxers in the world.
