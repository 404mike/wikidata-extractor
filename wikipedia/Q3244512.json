Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort \u2013 the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, Lily and James. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.\nHarry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time.

The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last was released in 2007.

She began writing adult novels while working as a temp, although they were never published. In 1990, she planned to move with her boyfriend to Manchester, and frequently took long train trips to visit. In mid-1990, she was on a train delayed by four hours from Manchester to London, when the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came plainly into her mind.

She was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it. She had a difficult relationship with her father, and her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing. She later said that the Mirror of Erised is about her mother's death, and noted an \"evident parallelism\" between Harry confronting his own mortality and her life.", "Five months after arriving in Porto, Rowling met the Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found that they shared an interest in Jane Austen.

Early in the year, Rowling began to experience a deep depression and sought medical help when she contemplated suicide. The depression inspired the Dementors \u2013 soul-sucking creatures introduced in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. With nine months of therapy, things gradually improved. She filed for divorce on 10 August 1994 and the divorce was finalised on 26 June 1995.", "Rowling began attending a Church of Scotland congregation, where Jessica was christened, around the time she was writing Harry Potter.

Her brother-in-law had bought a partnership in a cafe called Nicolson's, where Joanne went to write. Secretarial work brought in \u00a315 ($22.50) per week, but if she made more than that, she would lose government benefits. In the summer of 1995, a friend gave her money that allowed her to go off benefits and enrol full-time in school. Still needing money and expecting to make a living by teaching, Rowling began a teacher training course in August 1995 at Moray House School of Education (now part of the University of Edinburgh) after completing her first novel while living on benefits.

It was submitted to twelve publishers, all of which rejected the manuscript. Barry Cunningham, who ran the children's literature department at Bloomsbury Publishing, eventually bought it. Nigel Newton, who headed Bloomsbury at the time, decided to go ahead with the manuscript after his eight-year-old daughter finished one chapter and wanted to keep reading. Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, one of Rowling's favourite memories was of Cunningham telling her, \"You'll never make any money out of children's books, Jo.\" In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500\u00a0copies.

According to her biographer Sean Smith, this was effective marketing for Harry Potter. Before Chamber of Secrets was published, Rowling received only \u00a32,800 ($4,200) in royalties. Her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought, along with fame, religious concerns from parents about the books. Ultimately, Smith says that these concerns served to \"increase her public profile rather than damage it\".", "In mid-2011, Rowling left Christopher Little Literary Agency and followed her agent Neil Blair to the Blair Partnership. He represented her for the publication of The Casual Vacancy, released on 27 September 2012 by Little, Brown and Company.

Beyond encyclopedia content, the post-2015 Pottermore included promotions for Warner Bros. films including Fantastic Beasts.", "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child premiered in the West End in May 2016 and on Broadway in July. At its London premiere, Rowling confirmed that she would not write any more Harry Potter books. Rowling, the playwright Jack Thorne, and the director John Tiffany collaborated to some degree on the play. Literary critics Anastasia Salter and Mel Stanfill describe Rowling's role as \"relatively minor\", noting that some reports describe her contribution as limited to the story concept.

", "Cursed Child follows the friendship between Harry's son Albus and Scorpius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's son, covering their first four years at Hogwarts. Its setting is closer to contemporary reality than that of the Harry Potter novels. Some fans saw the relationship between Albus and Scorpius as a case of queerbaiting, while others argued that romantic love between two young men was not something the narrative was willing to countenance at all.", "The Ickabog, Rowling's first book aimed at children since Harry Potter, is set in the realm of Cornucopia, ruled by King Fred. The eponymous Ickabog is a monster that turns out to be real. While King Fred is bamboozled by his sinister advisors, who take control of the kingdom and begin a reign of terror, a group of children find out the truth about the Ickabog and save the day. Rowling released The Ickabog for free online in mid-2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. She began writing it as early as 2009 but set it aside to focus on other works including Casual Vacancy. Scholastic held a competition to select children's art for the print edition, which was published in the US and Canada on 10 November 2020. Rowling said that profits would go to charities focused on COVID-19 relief.", "Rowling acknowledges Homer, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare as literary influences. Scholars agree that Harry Potter is heavily influenced by the juvenile fantasy of writers such as C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Elizabeth Goudge, Ursula K. Le Guin, Dianna Wynne Jones, and E. Nesbit. According to the critic Beatrice Groves, Harry Potter is also \"rooted in the Western literary tradition\", including the classics. Commentators also note similarities to the children's stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl. Rowling expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent, but rejects any connection with Dahl.", "Earlier works prominently featuring characters who learn to use magic include Le Guin's Earthsea series, in which a school of wizardry also appears, and the Chrestomanci books by Jones. Rowling's setting of a \"school of witchcraft and wizardry\" departs from the still older tradition of protagonists as apprentices to accomplished magicians, famously exemplified by The Sorcerer's Apprentice: yet this trope does appear in Harry Potter, when Harry receives individual instruction from Remus Lupin and other teachers. Rowling also draws on the tradition of stories set in boarding schools, the most prominent example of which is Thomas Hughes's 1857 volume Tom Brown's School Days.", "Harry Potter has been defined as a fairy tale, a Bildungsroman, and a work about the characters' education. The books portray two parallel worlds that sometimes intermingle, but are distinct: a contemporary world inhabited by Muggles, and another by wizards. The literary scholar Suman Gupta adds a third world: the reader's world. The wizarding world is populated with legendary creatures and characterised by motifs drawn from British history; it also features the use of magic instead of technology. Magic enhances the ordinary and makes everyday objects extraordinary. Rowling lavishes attention to the smallest detail in the magical world, which some critics view as enhancing its veracity. There are many spells and charms; owls deliver letters; photographs and paintings present live images. John Pennington takes a different view: he writes that Rowling breaks the fundamental rules of fantasy by adhering too closely to reality.", "Like C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter contains Christian symbolism and allegory. The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul. Children's literature critic Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ, writing that \"magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality\". There are numerous connections between Harry's story and that of Jesus: Harry is hidden at birth; Dumbledore tells Harry \"your father ... shows himself most plainly when you have need of him\"; and Dobby says \"Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end\". According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an \"ecce homo\" speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy.", "Harry Potter overarching theme is death. In the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and \"a terrible sadness\" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him. Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in Deathly Hallows. The series has an existential perspective \u2013 Harry must grow mature enough to accept death. According to Rowling, all seven books thematise death and its meaning. In Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees. Unlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.", "The Harry Potter series has enjoyed enormous commercial success. It topped bestseller lists, spawned a global media franchise including films and video games, and was translated into at least 60 languages by 2008. The last four books \u2013 Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows \u2013 each set records as the fastest-selling books in the UK or US. , the series had sold more than 500\u00a0million copies according to Bloomsbury. Neither of Rowling's later works, The Casual Vacancy and the Cormoran Strike series, have been as successful, though their reception was positive. Harry Potter popularity has been attributed to factors including the nostalgia evoked by the boarding-school story, the endearing nature of Rowling's characters, and the accessibility of her books to a variety of readers. According to Julia Eccleshare, the books are \"neither too literary nor too popular, too difficult nor too easy, neither too young nor too old\", and hence bridge traditional reading divides.", "Critical response has been more mixed. Harold Bloom regards Rowling's prose as poor and her plots as conventional, while Jack Zipes argues that the series would not be successful if it were not formulaic. Zipes states that the early novels have the same plot: in each book, Harry escapes the Dursleys to visit Hogwarts, where he confronts Lord Voldemort and then heads back successful. Rowling's prose has been described as simple and not innovative; Ursula K. Le Guin, like several other critics, considers it \"stylistically ordinary\". According to the novelist A. S. Byatt, the books reflect a dumbed-down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television. Thus, some critics argue, Harry Potter does not innovate on established literary forms; nor does it challenge readers' preconceived ideas. This view is not uniformly held. The scholar Philip Nel rejects such critiques as \"snobbery\" that reacts to the novels' popularity, whereas Mary Pharr argues that Harry Potter conventionalism is the point: by amalgamating literary forms familiar to her readers, Rowling invites them to \"ponder their own ideas\".", "The Harry Potter series has been described as including complex and varied representations of female characters, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender. Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles. According to scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series. The final three books \"showcase richer roles and more powerful females\": for instance, the series' \"most matriarchal character\", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione's status as a feminist model is debated. Girls and women are more frequently shown as emotional, more often defined by their appearance, and less often given agency in family settings.", "Wizards are classified according to whether one or both of their parents are also wizards. \"Purebloods\" have two wizard parents; \"half-bloods\" have one; and \"Muggle-born\" wizards have magical abilities although neither of their parents is a wizard. Lord Voldemort and his followers believe that blood purity is paramount and that Muggles are subhuman. According to the literary scholar Andrew Blake, Harry Potter rejects blood purity as a basis for social division; Suman Gupta agrees that Voldemort's philosophy represents \"absolute evil\"; and Nel and Eccleshare agree that advocates of racial or blood-based hierarchies are antagonists. However, Blake points out that although the series rejects blood purity, it establishes a clear hierarchy: wizards are just better than Muggles are. Gupta, following Blake, suggests that the essential superiority of wizards over Muggles \u2013 wizards can use magic and Muggles cannot \u2013 means that the books cannot coherently reject anti-Muggle prejudice by appealing to equality between wizards and Muggles. Rather, according to Gupta, Harry Potter models a form of tolerance based on the \"charity and altruism of those belonging to superior races\" towards lesser races.", "There have been attempts to ban Harry Potter around the world, especially in the United States, and in the Bible Belt in particular. The series topped the American Library Association's list of most challenged books in the first three years of its publication. In the following years, parents in several US cities launched protests against teaching it in schools. Some Christian critics, particularly Evangelical Christians, have claimed that the novels promote witchcraft and harm children; similar opposition has been expressed to the film adaptations. Criticism has taken two main forms: allegations that Harry Potter is a pagan text; and claims that it encourages children to oppose authority, derived mainly from Harry's rejection of the Dursleys, his adoptive parents. Author and scholar Amanda Cockrell suggests that Harry Potter popularity, and recent preoccupation with fantasy and the occult among Christian fundamentalists, explains why the series received particular opposition.", "The Harry Potter books also have a group of vocal religious supporters who believe that Harry Potter espouses Christian values, or that the Bible does not prohibit the forms of magic described in the series. Christian analyses of the series have argued that it embraces ideals of friendship, loyalty, courage, love, and the temptation of power. After the final volume was published, Rowling said she intentionally incorporated Christian themes, in particular the idea that love may hold power over death. According to Farmer, it is a profound misreading to think that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft. Scholar Em McAvan writes that evangelical objections to Harry Potter are superficial, based on the presence of magic in the books: they do not attempt to understand the moral messages in the series.", "Harry Potter has been credited with transforming the landscape of children's literature. Beginning in the 1970s, children's books on the market were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic. In parallel, adult fantasy became popular due to the influence of The Lord of the Rings. The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.", "The commercial success of Harry Potter in 1997 reversed this trend. The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue. Children's literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre therein. Older works in the genre, including Diana Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series and Diane Duane's Young Wizards, were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers. In the following decades, many Harry Potter imitators and subversive responses grew popular.", "Rowling has been compared to Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market. She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl. Some critics view Harry Potter rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure. This is reflected in the BBC's 2003 \"Big Read\" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers\u00a03 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top\u00a010.", "Harry Potter popularity led its publishers to plan elaborate releases and spawned a textual afterlife among fans and forgers. Beginning with the release of Prisoner of Azkaban on 8 July 1999 at 3:45\u00a0pm, its publishers coordinated to begin selling the books at a single time globally, introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases, and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time. Driven by the growth of internet access and use around its initial publication, fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers. While Rowling has supported fan fiction, her statements about characters \u2013 for instance, that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple, and that Dumbledore was gay \u2013 have complicated her relationship with readers. According to scholars, this shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of, and sometimes contradicts, authorial intent.", "In the 1990s and 2000s, Rowling was both a plaintiff and defendant in lawsuits alleging copyright infringement. Nancy Stouffer sued Rowling in 1999, alleging that Harry Potter was based on stories she published in 1984. Rowling won in September 2002. Richard Posner describes Stouffer's suit as deeply flawed and notes that the court, finding she had used \"forged and altered documents\", assessed a $50,000 penalty against her.", "With her literary agents and Warner Bros., Rowling has brought legal action against publishers and writers of Harry Potter knockoffs in several countries. In the mid-2000s, Rowling and her publishers obtained a series of injunctions prohibiting sales or published reviews of her books before their official release dates.", "Beginning in 2001, after Rowling sold film rights to Warner Bros., the studio tried to take Harry Potter fan sites offline unless it determined that they were made by \"authentic\" fans for innocuous purposes. In 2007, with Warner Bros., Rowling started proceedings to cease publication of a book based on content from a fan site called The Harry Potter Lexicon. Rowling had named Lexicon a favourite fan site in 2004. She said at trial that she had already written a Harry Potter encyclopedia. The court held that Lexicon was neither a fair use of Rowling's material nor a derivative work. The judgment did not close the door completely on publishing Lexicon, however, and it eventually came out in 2009.", "Several publications in the Harry Potter universe have been sold for charitable purposes. Profits from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, both published in 2001, went to Comic Relief. To support Children's Voice, later renamed Lumos, Rowling sold a deluxe copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard at auction in 2007. Amazon's \u00a31.95\u00a0million purchase set a record for a contemporary literary work and for children's literature. Rowling published the book and, in 2013, donated the proceeds of nearly \u00a319\u00a0million (then about US$30\u00a0million) to Lumos. In 2008, Rowling and 12 other writers composed short pieces to be sold to benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel.", "Rowling has a difficult relationship with the press and has tried to influence the type of coverage she receives. She described herself in 2003 as \"too thin-skinned\" with regard to the press. Rita Skeeter, a character in the Harry Potter universe, was inspired by her negative experiences with journalists. As of 2011, she had taken more than 50 actions against the press.

In the second chapter, Snape claims to have been working for Voldemort ever since the latter's return, and only pretending to help Dumbledore. By killing Dumbledore toward the end of the novel, Snape seems to place himself firmly in Voldemort's camp. Rowling maintains this impression through the early chapters of the seventh novel. However, near the climax of the book, Snape leaves Harry his dying thoughts (to be viewed in the Pensieve) and ultimately reveals to Harry that he had been loyal to Albus Dumbledore throughout the series.

I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information.\" Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself.

At six years old, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who had witnessed her performing magic. Because of this attack, Ariana was seriously traumatised and never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the Muggle boys (killing them in the film version), and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. After this, Kendra moved her family to the village of Godric's Hollow.

He frequently creates complex objects like sofa chairs out of thin air (or from less comfortable chairs). Dumbledore is also proficient at Charms and Potions; according to the obituary written by Elphias Doge, his papers were published in journals such as Achievements in Charming and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore is famous for defeating Grindelwald, who is second on a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time only to Voldemort himself, in a \"spectacular duel of legend\", succeeding in doing so despite the fact that Grindelwald possessed the Elder Wand, which supposedly guarantees invincibility in duels due to its power. His skill at duelling is further shown when he calmly engages Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, overpowering him and eventually forcing him to possess Harry to be spared from total defeat. (It is known in retrospect that Dumbledore possessed the Elder Wand when duelling Voldemort, having taken it from Grindelwald.)

Frightened, they first try to get her to repeat what they had seen, and upon her failure to recreate it due to her young age, they try to stop her from being \"different\". The severe trauma of the attack leaves Ariana unable to function socially or to properly perform magic again. It is not explicitly stated in the novel what form this attack took, but Percival is given a life sentence in Azkaban for tracking down and hexing the boys who traumatised his daughter.

IGN also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite Harry Potter character, saying that \"[f]or a character that was introduced into popular culture a mere twelve years ago, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film\". IGN's Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite Harry Potter character, calling the revelation that he wasn't so \"infallible\" one of the most heartbreaking themes of the final book. Actor Michael Gambon received some criticism for his louder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as exhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books. This has been attributed to Gambon's policy of not reading the source material from which his films are adapted.", "As a main character of the series, major facts relating to Dumbledore have generated a vast number of essays and discussions.

While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to the American variant \"mom\" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.

Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.", "Some reviewers compared Philosopher's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant auntsone fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant.

Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.", "The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999.

The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including \"Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry,\" and \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand what that meant\" in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.", "Another case involved the Internet fan translation community, Harry auf Deutsch, formed to translate the Harry Potter books into German more rapidly.

Friday 27 June 2003. Retrieved on 11 May 2009.", "It is a common practice within the publishing industry to make minor changes in the text of books written in one region for publication in other regions. For example, there are a number of differences in British and American English spelling conventions; generally publishers change the spellings to conform to the expectations of their target market. Adaptation may also extend to vocabulary or grammatical choices that might impair legibility or impart some cognitive dissonance. Readers usually would not be aware of the adaptations, but the choice to change the title of the American edition of the first Harry Potter book from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone highlighted the practice and drew considerable attention.", "The book's title was changed due to the American publisher's concern that children would be confused by a reference to philosophy. Other translations have also changed the first book's title, for instance, the French translation which changed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to Harry Potter at the School of Wizards for the same reason as the American translation, citing that the reference to the Philosopher's stone legend was \"too obscure for a book aimed at the youth.\"", "The American English adaptations have by far received the most attention. A comprehensive list of differences between the American and British editions of the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon website. The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect the different dialects and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar Briticisms. Although it is common to adapt any text from British to American editions, in the case of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series. Rowling herself expressed regret over changing the first book's title, as the Philosopher's stone is a legendary alchemical substance.", "The Harry Potter series presents many challenges to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have been dealt with by various translators with different degrees of modification to the meaning of the original text.", "Marketers of Harry Potter-themed toys pressured translators not to change the names of people and things so that they could call the toys by the same name in different countries.", "The title of the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, proved particularly difficult to translate into different languages. Rowling solved the problem by providing translators with an alternate title: Harry Potter and the Relics of Death. This became the basis for most translations of the title.", "The series involves many songs, poems, and rhymes, some of which proved difficult to translators. One rhyme, a riddle told by a sphinx in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, posed a particular problem. The riddle involves taking words from a poem and using them to form a longer word, \"spider,\" in answer to the riddle. In the Taiwanese translation, the English words are simply put in parentheses. In other translations, the riddle is changed to provide different words that can be put together to make up the translated version of \"spider\".", "Areas in which anagrams are present do not make the transition easily into other languages. The name \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\", first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is rearranged to spell \"I am Lord Voldemort\". This has required translators to alter Riddle's name to make the anagram work. Sometimes translators manage to alter only one part of the name. For example, Tom Riddle's middle name of Marvolo was changed to Marvolodemus in the Serbian second edition; the first edition had lacked the anagram and the original name Tom Marvolo Riddle had simply been copied. In the Bulgarian translation his middle name becomes \"Mersvoluko\" so the whole name forms an anagram for \"And here I am, Lord Voldemort\" (instead of \"I am Lord Voldemort\" as in the original English). Analogous alterations of the middle name Marvolo have been made in several other languages; for example; it became Servoleo in Brazilian Portuguese, Vandrolo in Hebrew, Marvoldo in Turkish, Vorlost in German, Narvolo in Russian, Sorvolo in Spanish, Rojvol in Czech, Marvoloso in Slovak, and Orvoloson in Italian (Note: the original Italian version kept the English name, having Riddle translate the anagram in his speech that immediately follows. The change to Orvoloson was made in later editions, although the revisited translation returned to \"Marvolo\" and kept the phrase in English, assuming the reader could understand it themselves.). In the Latin version his name is Tom Musvox Ruddle, which is an anagram of \"Sum Dux Voldemort\", or \"I am the leader Voldemort\".", "In Hungarian, Voldemort's name becomes \"Tom Rowle Denem\", which is an anagram of \"Nevem Voldemort\" (\"My name is Voldemort\"), with the \"w\" in the name becoming two \"v\"s. This caused a name collision with the character Thorfinn Rowle, who first appears in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but who is not related to Voldemort. Because of this collision, in the Hungarian translation his family name was altered to Rovel. The Arabic version avoids the issue entirely by having Riddle directly write out, \"I am Lord Voldemort\" (\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0641\u0648\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062a). These changes to the name created problems in later books however; in the English edition, a line of dialogue mentions that Tom Riddle shares his given name with the bartender of the Leaky Cauldron, and this becomes a plot point. However, this is not the case in all translations.", "Similarly, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, when Professor McGonagall is about to introduce Harry to Oliver Wood, she asks another professor if she can \"borrow Wood for a moment\", momentarily confusing Harry; in order to retain this wordplay, the Yiddish translation renames Wood as \"Oliver Holtz\", \"holtz\" being the Yiddish for wood, unlike the Italian one, which changed the surname to \"Baston\", from \"bastone\", \"stick\", but returned to the original \"Wood\" with the second translation.", "Often, names in Harry Potter have historical or linguistic significance in English, which may create problems if the translator does not recognise or misjudges it. Rowling commented on this phenomenon in Conversations with J.K. Rowling, in which she complained that the Italian translation of Professor Dumbledore's last name was \"Silente\"; rather than recognising that \"Dumbledore\" was an old Devon word for \"bumblebee,\" the translator took the word \"dumb\" and translated it as \"silent\".Conversations with J.K. Rowling, Lindsey Fraser, Arthur E. Levine Books, 2001 In contrast, the Czech translator used the Old Czech word for bumblebee \u2013 Brumb\u00e1l (in modern Czech \u010dmel\u00e1k). The French translation renamed Severus Snape as 'Rogue'; in Italian he was renamed \"Piton\" (from the Italian \"pitone\", \"python\"). Hungarian also calls him \"Piton\". Instead, the same Italian translation changed the name of Professor Sybill Trelawney into \"Sibilla Cooman\", which resembles the Italian \"Sibilla Cumana\", the Cumaean Sibyl, although, like many other names, it was brought back to the original in the revised translation.", "In some cases, English-speaking fans have sought clues to the story's mysteries by examining the way certain parts of the books have been translated in foreign editions. A case in point is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', svart being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was Regulus Black, the brother of Sirius Black; when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published, this was revealed to be the case.", "Similarly, the title for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix did not make it obvious whether the word \"Order\" referred to a group of people or to a directive. The information that it was a group of people was then determined by viewing the title in other languages. The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted \"Order\" as a directive and translated it as \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 M\u1ec7nh l\u1ec7nh Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\"; when it became clear that \"Order\" referred to a group of people, the title was changed to \"Harry Potter v\u00e0 H\u1ed9i Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng ho\u00e0ng\".", "Rowling released an alternative title for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning. The alternative title (in English) is Harry Potter and the Relics of Death.Swedish Deathly Hallows translation may give clues, Mugglenet, 25 May 2007 In Italy the title has been translated as Harry Potter e i doni della morte replacing \"hallows\" with \"presents\" because the word \"relic\" is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint.

In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At the beginning of the school year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, screaming at him in anger that he and Harry flew the family car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at The Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night about telling Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley to keep an eye on Harry at the school.", "When Harry arrives at the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's experimentation with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that something might have happened to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, for the first time in his life, he has someone to be there for him, like a mother.", "Molly and the Weasleys are staying at the Order headquarters, Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she and Sirius fight over how much to tell Harry about the Order's operations. Days later, Molly is found in the drawing room, with a boggart that transforms into her dead family members and Harry, and confesses her nightmares of losing more family members to Voldemort and the Death Eaters. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Molly clashes with Bill's fianc\u00e9e, Fleur Delacour; however, at the end of the novel, when Molly rushes to Hogwarts with her husband and Fleur to tend to her son Bill, who had been ferociously attacked by Fenrir Greyback, Fleur is greatly offended when Molly jumps to the conclusion she will break up with Bill due to his scarring, letting her know in no uncertain terms that his scars are a reminder of the courage that Bill displayed.Rowling, J.K. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (New York: Scholastic, Inc.), 2005, page 623. Fleur and Molly unexpectedly hug and begin to see each other in a much more positive light.", "At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Molly and Arthur offer the Burrow as Order headquarters when Grimmauld Place is no longer safe. She feels immensely uncomfortable with the trio's decision to drop out of Hogwarts and initially attempts to dissuade them from doing so. As the novel progresses, the family is forced to head for safety at Auntie Muriel's home. At the end of the book, Molly and her entire family fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. She is devastated by the death of her son Fred and is pushed to the edge when Bellatrix Lestrange almost strikes Ginny with the Killing Curse. Enraged, she engages Bellatrix in an intense duel, killing her with a curse that hits her in the chest.\"New Interview with J.K. Rowling for Release of Dutch Edition of 'Deathly Hallows'.\" (18 November 2007). The Leaky Cauldron. Retrieved 19 November 2007. Rowling has stated that the reason she had Molly kill Bellatrix was to show Molly's great powers as a witch and to provide a contrast between Molly's consumption with \"maternal love\" and Bellatrix's with \"obsessive love\".", "The Chicago Tribunes Courtney Crowder lists Molly Weasley as her favourite literary mother, describing her as the \"original Mama Grizzly\", citing her many touching moments with Harry as well as the final book in the series, where \"her feelings jumped off the page\" as testament to her strong personality. Crowder summarises Molly's character as \"levelheaded, yet willing to fight, intelligent, welcoming, and above all, extremely loving\". In a Mother's Day article Molly was also voted the third greatest celebrity mother by The Flowers and Plants association who see the character as \"formidable, practical, creative and resourceful\". Bob Smietana of Christianity Today links Molly's defence of Ginny in the final book into a wider theme in the series about the strength of parental love, which he feels to carry considerable emotional weight. Empire listed Molly Weasley 24th on their Top 30 Harry Potter characters. Novelist Stephen King notes that when Molly called Bellatrix a \"bitch\" after she sees the Death Eater trying to kill Ginny, it was \"the most shocking bitch in recent fiction\", and that it shows how adult the books had become.", "*The Harry Potter Lexicon item on the Order of the Phoenix", "Category:Harry Potter organisations"]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "response": ["Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.", "The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only Harry Potter novel to do so, in 2001. The book was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.", "Throughout the three previous novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, has struggled with the difficulties of growing up and the added challenge of being a famed wizard. When Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but was mysteriously defeated after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, though his attempt left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed in the care of his abusive Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley.", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, followed on 8 July 1999. Goblet of Fire is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.", "Until the official title's announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, 'Harry Potter IV.' Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. However, J.\u00a0K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an Entertainment Weekly interview.", "\"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out\u00a0\u2014 Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. Then I changed Doomspell to Triwizard Tournament. Then I was teetering between Goblet of Fire and Triwizard Tournament. In the end, I preferred Goblet of Fire because it's got that kind of cup of destiny feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\"", "Jeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for Entertainment Weekly in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the Harry Potter novels and Goblet of Fire in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in Goblet of Fire, Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.\" When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,", "Goblet of Fire was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has received mostly positive reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was \"every bit as good as Potters\u00a01 through 3\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\". Kirkus Reviews called it \"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\". For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying \"some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs\". A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's \"red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience\" and saying it \"might be her most thrilling yet.\" Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that \"where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.\"", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after Philosopher's Stone and Prisoner of Azkaban. The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was \"more intense than the first three books\". In addition, Entertainment Weekly listed Goblet of Fire in second place on their list of The New Classics: Books\u00a0\u2013 The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008.
