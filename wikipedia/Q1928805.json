Civil Engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the Stockton Street Tunnel, the Twin Peaks Tunnel, the San Francisco Municipal Railway, the Auxiliary Water Supply System, and new sewers. San Francisco's streetcar system, of which the J, K, L, M, and N lines survive today, was pushed to completion by O'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927. It was the O'Shaughnessy Dam, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, and Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct that would have the largest effect on San Francisco. An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today."]}, {"page": "William Mulholland", "response": ["In May 1913, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), which owned the water supply of San Francisco, authorized an executive committee to approve plans and direct construction of the original dam to create Calaveras Reservoir; the committee was also authorized to hire Mulholland as a consultant. That October, with construction of the dam underway, San Francisco's City Engineer, Michael O'Shaughnessy, wrote negatively of Mulholland in a letter to John R. Freeman, an engineer who had assisted the city in its pursuit of permission to construct the Hetch Hetchy reservoir and water system in Yosemite National Park.

The steep terrain dictated a 4-degree roadbed, roughly twice as steep as a \"regular\" railroad. The steep grades dictated geared-down locomotives. The first  of the Hetch Hetchy Railroad (HHRR) were completed in 1915, and the remaining  were completed by October 1917. Construction costs for the HHRR were about US$3 million, far less than what the city might have paid contractors to transport workers, concrete and other materials for the dam over the rough and steep terrain by 12 mule train wagons. The president of the railroad was San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, and the vice president and general manager was the construction project's chief engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy. The Hetch Hetchy Railroad was begun as a connection of the Sierra Railway at Hetch Hetchy Junction,  west of Jamestown, and extended another  to the Hetch Hetchy Dam (later named the O'Shaughnessy Dam after the chief engineer) site for delivery of construction workers and materials. The regular trains were supplemented by trucks converted to run on the tracks to carry unscheduled loads of men or supplies or evacuate ambulance patients. The railroad was dismantled and part of its road bed converted into a highway after the Michael O'Shaughnessy dam was completed, and the new  Don Pedro Reservoir built in 1971 flooded part of the original track line.Wurm, Ted; \"Hetch Hetchy and Its Dam Railroad\"; Trans Anglo Books; Reprint edition (April 1990);"]}, {"page": "List of Limerick people", "response": ["*Michael O'Shaughnessy, designed the San Francisco streetcar system (1927), the O'Shaughnessy Dam (1923) and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct (1923)."]}, {"page": "Lake Eleanor", "response": ["The remote location dictated the use of an unusual multiple-arch structure here.

The city hired John R. Freeman, who had previously worked on the water supply systems of Boston and New York City, to plan the complex dam and aqueduct system. Civil engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy would oversee the construction and design details of the Hetch Hetchy project. The dam in Hetch Hetchy Valley would subsequently be named in his honor.

Construction began in fall 1896, directed by San Diego city engineer Edwin Capps. The initial construction was fraught with problems caused by leakage and poor engineering, and work stopped in April 1898. It was not until May 1909 when construction resumed, under engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy.
