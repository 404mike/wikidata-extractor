Many of his photographs are available at the University of Florida Digital Collections site, \"Wildlife Conservation\". He was raised in Nairobi, Kenya by his English parents who had fled from the aftermath of the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Leakey", "response": ["In the first expedition to Allia Bay on Lake Turkana, where the Koobi Fora camp came to be located, Leakey hired primarily young researchers. The students included John Harris and Bernard Wood. Also present was a team of Africans under Kamoya: a geochemist, Paul Abel, and a photographer, Bob Campbell. Margaret was the archaeologist. In contrast to his father, Richard ran a disciplined and tidy camp, although, in order to find fossils, he did push the expedition harder than it wished."]}, {"page": "Dian Fossey", "response": ["During her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of a Rhodesian she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife. Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and on his marriage. In 1970, studying for her Ph.D. at Darwin College, University of Cambridge, she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that \"you can't be a cover girl for National Geographic magazine and be pregnant.\" She graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology in 1976. Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children. Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a menagerie in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy. Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a genuine friendship with Jane Goodall.", "Universal Studios bought the film rights to Gorillas in the Mist from Fossey in 1985, and Warner Bros. Studios bought the rights to \"the Dark Romance of Dian Fossey\", a work by Harold T. P. Hayes, despite its having been severely criticized by Rosamond Carr. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film Gorillas in the Mist, starring Sigourney Weaver, Bryan Brown, and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer Bob Campbell. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by Bryan Brown) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home."]}, {"page": "Robert Campbell", "response": ["Robert, Bobby or Bob Campbell may refer to:", "* Bob Campbell (Australian footballer) (1868\u20131946), for St. Kilda Football Club", "* Bob Campbell (soccer) (fl. 1926\u20131930), Scottish-American", "* Bob Campbell (American football) (born 1947), wide receiver", "* Bob Campbell (photographer) (born 1930), wildlife photographer and filmmaker"]}, {"page": "Gorillas in the Mist", "response": ["National Geographic, which funds her efforts, dispatches photographer Bob Campbell (Bryan Brown) to highlight her research.
