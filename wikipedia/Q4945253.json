These would show Britten composing and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with \"an intimate piece of musical education, by\u00a0... watching a piece of music take shape and in some degree growing with it\". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time  busy  travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera.Letter dated 15 April 1957, quoted in  However, he agreed to meet Ford  to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had \"for some months or a year vaguely been thinking of doing something with the [Chester] miracle plays\", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space."]}, {"page": "List of Old Greshamians", "response": ["*Boris Ford \u2013 literary critic, editor"]}, {"page": "List of masters of Gresham's School", "response": ["*Denys Thompson (assistant master, English, 1930s), editor of the quarterly Scrutiny with F.

Arthur Humphreys considered it \"a true and thoughtful poem\"; Boris Ford noted \"the judicious tone, the unruffled movement, the urbane and fluent control of the couplet\", which \"established him as a great Augustan poet\"; and Angus Ross thought that The Traveller proved him a poet with an individual voice, citing particularly its \"genuine and deep note of feeling\"."]}, {"page": "The Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain", "response": ["The Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain, later republished as The Cambridge Cultural History of Britain, is a guide to the arts in Britain from Prehistory to the post Second World War period.
