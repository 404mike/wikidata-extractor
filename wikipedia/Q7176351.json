His grandson, an artist born in 1971, also has the name Peter Peri.", "Peri immigrated to England in 1933, after his wife Mary Macnaghten, granddaughter of social reformer Charles Booth, was arrested in possession of Communist propaganda. In 1934, Peri contributed \"several forceful works in coloured concrete\" to the Artists\u2019 International Association (AIA) exhibition The Social Scene. He made contact with John Heartfield. In England, he lived first in Ladbroke Grove, then in Hampstead; in 1938, he moved to a studio in Camden Town where he worked until 1966. While in Hampstead, Peri joined the recently founded English section of the Artists International (later to be known as Artists International Association), an association composed largely of commercial artists and designers whose declared intention was to mobilise \"the international unity of artists against Imperialist War on the Soviet Union, Fascism and Colonial oppression\".  In July 1938, he had a solo exhibition London Life in Concrete in an empty building at 36 Soho Square. In 1939, he became a British citizen and took the name \"Peter Peri\". In November 1948, he held a solo show Peri's People at the AIA Gallery. Late in the 1940s he did a series of commissions for the London County Council. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. In 1951, Peri produced a sculptural group originally titled \u201cSunbathing group - Horizontal\u201d, later known as The Sunbathers for the Festival of Britain.The sculpture was rediscovered in 2017: Guardian Friday 21 April 2017 \"Naked ambition: \u00a315,000 appeal to revive nude sunbather statues\" by Mark Brown", "Peter Peri died on 19 January 1967.", "**1958 Longslade Grammar School.
