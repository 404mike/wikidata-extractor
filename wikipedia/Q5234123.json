He was a fast-medium bowler who captured over 500 wickets in his career, and also a useful enough batsman almost to rank as an all-rounder. He was also a fine rugby player, appearing at county level and in schoolboy internationals.His cricket career, though reasonably successful, could be considered an unlucky one. He never took 100 wickets in a season, but came close on several occasions. His best season with the bat saw him fall just four runs short of 1,000 runs. He never made a century, but had scores of 98 and 95 not out. Worst of all, he was struck down by an injury that all but finished his career just as he had appeared to have reached his peak.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mitcham", "response": ["*David Gibson \u2013 cricketer"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  David Gibson"]}, {"page": "Aldermaston", "response": ["The yard would take on three up-coming cricketers for the winter, in the hope that the hard work would \"toughen them up\" to get them picked for the England cricket team.
