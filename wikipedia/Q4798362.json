The signing of Arthur Crompton in February 1932 signalled the beginning of the end of Berry's time at Griffin Park and after making just one appearance during the early months of the 1932\u201333 season, he left the club in November 1932. He made 148 appearances and scored 44 goals in just over five seasons with the Bees.", "In November 1932, Berry joined Third Division South club Crystal Palace in a part-exchange deal which saw Idris Hopkins move to Brentford. In what remained of the 1932\u201333 season, Berry scored four goals in 17 appearances, but in an unlucky twist, he lost his place to new signing Arthur Crompton, whose signing had cost him his place at Brentford a year earlier. He closed out his Football League career with a short spell at Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, before moving to France to join National club SC Fives in 1934, where he remained until his retirement as a player in 1937."]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Arthur Crompton", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Arthur Crompton", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Arthur Crompton", "| Arthur Crompton"]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Arthur Crompton", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Arthur Crompton", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Arthur Crompton", "| Arthur Crompton"]}]}}
