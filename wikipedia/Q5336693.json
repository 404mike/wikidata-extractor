When the club beat Walsall Swifts 4\u20131 to win their first ever trophy, the Walsall Cup, in 1882\u201383, Stanley scored two and created another of the goals.\nHe also scored the first hat-trick for the club in national competitive football, netting four in a 9\u20132 FA Cup win against Burton Wanderers in 1885. Over his career he appeared in 22 FA Cup ties, scoring 14 goals, and made 13 appearances in Small Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, scoring 5 goals. Injury prevented him playing on after the end of that 1889\u201390 season and forced his retirement in 1891. He died in Birmingham aged about 70.", "link_mentions": {}}}
