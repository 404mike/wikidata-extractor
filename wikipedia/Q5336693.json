When the club beat Walsall Swifts 4\u20131 to win their first ever trophy, the Walsall Cup, in 1882\u201383, Stanley scored two and created another of the goals.\nHe also scored the first hat-trick for the club in national competitive football, netting four in a 9\u20132 FA Cup win against Burton Wanderers in 1885. Over his career he appeared in 22 FA Cup ties, scoring 14 goals, and made 13 appearances in Small Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, scoring 5 goals. Injury prevented him playing on after the end of that 1889\u201390 season and forced his retirement in 1891.

The heavy ground did not suit the visitors, Grimsby Town, and the Small Heath forwards' hard-working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three. The following week, the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking ironplate-workers. Around 1,500 spectators watched a match between tinplate- and ironplate-workers' elevens, followed by a second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter, whose poor health prevented him playing, and the recently retired Small Heath forward Eddy Stanley, who led his team to a 9\u20133 victory. Small Heath went into March with a four-point lead over Darwen, each club having only two League games left to play, but the former's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United, in third place, ten points behind with five games in hand, were the only team still able to overhaul them."]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club.

In more recent times, John Gayle scored the winning goal as Birmingham beat Tranmere Rovers in the 1991 Football League Trophy Final.

They took an early two-goal lead against Birmingham St George's at Coventry Road, and although Saints equalised before the interval and had the better of the second half, Chris Charsley's goalkeeping and Fred Speller's defence kept the Heathens in the game, and Will Devey took advantage of a goalkeeping error for the winning goal. During the reserve team match played the same day, a young opponent was kneed in the abdomen; he died of his injuries two days later in Birmingham General Hospital.Fatal Accident in the Football Field. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 10 September 1889. Walter Gittins and Wilton Lines made their debuts at home to Bootle in front of a large crowd, attracted by Bootle's success in holding \"the Invincibles\"\u00a0\u2013 Preston North End, champions of the Football League, who had gone through the inaugural season unbeaten\u00a0\u2013 to a draw in a friendly match. Small Heath came out of the match with a 2\u20132 draw, with goals from Devey and Eddy Stanley in the first 12 minutes of the game. Bootle scored once before Thomas Davenport narrowly failed to increase Heath's lead when he headed against the crossbar, and after Bootle tied the scores, the defence of both sides worked hard to keep the scores tied. For the third Alliance match in succession, Small Heath let slip a lead, as their visit to Walsall Town Swifts finished at one goal apiece, and September ended with a 3\u20131 defeat of Burslem Port Vale in a \"somewhat dull\" friendly.", "A goalless visit to Nottingham Forest, where but both sides' forwards were \"altogether nonplussed by the wind, which careered about in the wildest gusts\", was a better result for the visitors than for their hosts.Sports and Pastimes.

The 18-year-old Billy Walton made a \"not conspicuously successful\" debut;Notes on Sport. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 5. 4 November 1889. Walton had attended the 1886 FA Cup semi-final as a supporter of the then Small Heath Alliance, was to play for the club for fourteen years, helped clear snow from the pitch so that the official opening of the St Andrew's Ground in 1906 could go ahead, was present at the 1931 and 1956 FA Cup Finals, and attended St Andrew's until not long before his death in 1963. The match with Walsall Town Swifts began late because the visitors' kit had gone missing. Walsall's defence was sound, if unnecessarily rough, and their forwards took advantage of mistakes by Gittins and Speller to clinch a 2\u20130 win. Small Heath had no difficulty progressing in the Association Cup, winning 5\u20131 at the home of Wednesbury Old Athletic.
