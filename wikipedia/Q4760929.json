From there Leaning went on to have spells at Sheffield United, Bristol City, Lincoln City, Dundee and Chesterfield, before retiring from playing in 2000. Over the course of his 15-year career in professional football he made 282 league and cup appearances. He was promoted with Bristol City after a second-place finish in the Third Division in 1989\u201390, and was named as Lincoln City's Player of the Year in 1995. Since 2000 he has been employed as goalkeeping coach at a number of his former clubs including York City, Sheffield United, and Chesterfield, as well as Leeds United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round in 1985\u201386, and took the lead through Gary Ford only to concede a stoppage time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succumbed to a 3\u20131 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for \u00a315,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed when he first came to the club were coming to the end of their careers. The 1986\u201387 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 1\u20130 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3\u20130. Smith ended up falling out with the club's directors, who invested money in the club's facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes."]}, {"page": "Mike Pollitt", "response": ["On 24 September 1992, he rejoined Lincoln City on a month's loan to cover for Ian Bowling who fractured his foot in a 3\u20131 League Cup defeat away to Crystal Palace two days previously. Pollitt made his Football League debut in the 1\u20130 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town on 26 September 1992 and made five league appearances for the club, one of which came against his parent club Bury, before relinquishing his place to the returning Bowling. Pollitt however remained on loan at Sincil Bank and at the end of the second month, Lincoln officially took over the remainder of Pollitt's Bury contract. Following a brief sojourn to appear a further time for Altrincham in the 2\u20130 home victory over Welling United on 19 December 1992, he managed to displace Bowling from the Lincoln side over the Christmas fixtures and a series of impressive displays saw him rewarded with a new two-year contract in March 1993. He began the 1993\u20131994 season as the Imps first-choice goalkeeper before briefly losing his place to John Burridge over the Christmas and New Year fixtures and permanently following the signing of Andy Leaning in March 1994. In the summer, one of the first acts of newly appointed Lincoln manager Sam Ellis was to transfer list Pollitt and Dave Ridings and Pollitt soon agreed a move to Darlington."]}, {"page": "Richard Cresswell", "response": ["Cresswell returned to York as a commercial, academy and community development consultant in April 2014, having previously intended to pursue a career in coaching. He took on the position of Head of Football Operations, before being appointed as first-team coach to manager Russ Wilcox in March 2015. In May 2015, Cresswell resumed his role as Head of Football Operations, while continuing to coach the first team. He took over as caretaker manager on 26 October 2015 after Wilcox's dismissal, and was assisted by youth team coach Jonathan Greening and goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning. He was in charge for the 1\u20130 away defeat to Crawley Town on 31 October 2015, before ceasing his caretaker duties upon the appointment of Jackie McNamara as manager on 4 November. Cresswell left York by mutual consent on 16 December 2015."]}, {"page": "Gordon Staniforth", "response": ["He then worked as co-ordinator of York College's Football Development Centre, alongside former York City goalkeeper Andy Leaning.
