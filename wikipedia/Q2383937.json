Two men were chosen to lead the expedition, Joseph Ritchie and George Francis Lyon. Due to the unpredictable nature of the tribal groups likely to be encountered, particularly the Tuareg, it was essential to obtain some measure of protection from the bashaw, at least as far south as his influence would reach. Warrington was able to convince the bashaw to give his permission for the expedition and enabled the explorers to accompany a caravan leaving in the general direction of Timbuktu. This expedition, which resulted in the death of Joseph Ritchie, failed even to reach Timbuktu."]}, {"page": "Joseph Ritchie (disambiguation)", "response": ["Joseph Ritchie (c. 1788\u20131819) was an English surgeon, explorer and naturalist.", "Joseph Ritchie may also refer to:"]}, {"page": "Colchicum ritchii", "response": ["Colchicum ritchii was named by Robert Brown after Joseph Ritchie who he said was the first to observe the plant near Tripoli."]}, {"page": "Ritchie, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Ritchie"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (Q\u2013Z)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Ritchie\"|Joseph Ritchie (c. 1788 \u2013 1819)"]}, {"page": "Leonard Dupont", "response": ["Dupont was born in Bayeux, Normandy to wigmaker Jean-Antoine Puech dit Dupont and  Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Badin.

Their mother was a conchologist with a large collection of shells. The family moved to Paris and Leonard began to collect specimens and was a regular at the Jardin des Plantes, interacting with other naturalists. and working for sometime as a specimen preparator. In 1818 he was hired by Joseph Ritchie for an expedition into Africa along the Niger river. Ritchie and Dupont were also joined by George Francis Lyon (1795\u20131832) and John Belford. Dupont resigned from the group at Tripoli on 7 February 1819. The group had to disguise themselves as Muslims and Leonard took the name of Mourad but refused to be circumcised and fell afoul of Ritchie. This left Leonard stranded without money and he had to be repatriated by the French consul. Returning to France with a large set of specimens which were sold to naturalists resulted in several new species being described including Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti. "]}]}}
