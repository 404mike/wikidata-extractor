Ashley cites John Collier, Robert Arthur, Allen Drury, and Ray Bradbury, all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in F&SF in 1960, as evidence of the magazine's diversity.  Daniel Keyes had been unable to sell \"Flowers for Algernon\" until Mills bought it in 1959; it went on to win several awards and according to Clute and Nicholls is \"arguably the most popular sf novel ever published\".
