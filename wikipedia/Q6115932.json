The Foundation Trustees perceived a need for an initiative to bring professionals in the built environment together to study with a set of common objectives, and supported by leading academics and industry practitioners. A key concern of Sir Jack Zunz was to produce graduates who could engage with civil servants and policy makers at the highest level of government. He felt that the narrowness of engineering education in particular was a real impediment to this. In this way, the learning experience would not be limited to technical disciplines but extended across the humanities to broaden the participants\u2019 outlook. An initial proposal was made in the summer of 1989 by Sir Jack Zunz to Professor Peter Carolin, Head of the Department of Architecture at Cambridge, and Professor Jacques Heyman, Head of the Department of Engineering for an interdisciplinary summer school but the idea coincided with the Prince of Wales announcing his own summer school and was dropped.", "Cambridge's proposal was largely constructed by Professor Peter Carolin, then head of the Department of Architecture, and Dr Robin Spence, a lecturer in structural engineering in the Department and former employee at Arup. Approval was gained from Professor Alec Broers, then Head of the Department of Engineering. After a selection process, the Foundation agreed to support the Cambridge proposal. The trustees responsible for initiating the course were Sir Jack Zunz, Sir Philip Dowson, Ronald Hobbs and Povl Ahm.", "A discussion meeting was held on 16 October 1995 at the Royal Academy of Arts attended by over 60 leading industry delegates from consultancy and academia to discuss 'redefining the design team'.
