However, they ended the decade on a high, as they were promoted in the 1988\u201389 season, when under manager Frank Clark they were promoted in the Division Four Play-Off Final after a 2\u20131 aggregate victory over Wrexham F.C.. The early 1990s saw steady progress in the Third Division, missing out on a play-off place in the 1992\u201393 season on goal difference. However, the financial crisis at the club caused by then-chairman Tony Wood losing his business in the Rwandan Civil War led to a relegation back to the fourth tier, now renamed as the Third Division following the formation of the Premier League. Under manager Tommy Taylor, Orient were defeated in the 1999 and 2001 Third Division play-off finals, played at Wembley Stadium and the Millennium Stadium respectively. The latter final saw the fastest ever play-off final goal scored to date at the Millennium Stadium, as Orient's Chris Tate scored after just 27\u00a0seconds. Orient's fastest ever goal was scored after just 12\u00a0seconds by Lee Steele in a match against his former club Oxford at The Kassam Stadium on 28 March 2005.", "After the 2001 play-off final defeat, Leyton Orient took several years to recover from their second play-off final defeat in three years. After Tommy Taylor left the club, Paul Brush spent two unsuccessful years in charge and after he was sacked, former player Martin Ling took over as manager in October 2003, with Orient second-bottom of the league. After several years of steady improvement, Leyton Orient gained promotion in the 2005\u201306 season, finishing in third place and gaining automatic promotion to League One. This was the club's first automatic promotion in 36\u00a0years and ended a period of 11 years in the English league's bottom division. This promotion season also saw an excellent FA Cup run, with Leyton Orient progressing to the fourth round after beating Premiership side Fulham. Promotion was only secured in the final minutes of the final game of the season, away at Oxford United; with the score tied at 2\u20132 and Orient seemingly destined to miss out yet again, news came through of a late goal scored against promotion rivals Grimsby Town F.C. that would potentially promote Orient. The Orient fans were still celebrating this when just 14\u00a0seconds later, Lee Steele scored to confirm Orient's promotion. The result also relegated Oxford to the Football Conference. Grimsby's manager that season was Russell Slade, who would later become Orient's manager."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 in English football", "response": ["Carlisle United were another side who earned a second successive promotion, only two years after a relegation from the League that some predicted would see the end of the club. Northampton Town joined them, making up for two seasons of play-off disappointment, and Leyton Orient ended a decade in the bottom division by earning promotion in almost the last minute of the season. Grimsby Town conceded on 91 minutes, and 14 seconds after the fans of Orient celebrated, Lee Steele scored to seal promotion for Orient. Wycombe started the season with a 21-game unbeaten run that saw five of their players named in the PFA League Two team of the year. Two tragic off-the-field events, however, saw them fall away in the second part of the season before losing to Cheltenham Town in the playoff semi-finals. Grimsby Town lost 1\u20130 to Cheltenham in the final at the Millennium Stadium."]}, {"page": "Bootle F.C.", "response": ["*Lee Steele"]}, {"page": "Michael Coulson (footballer)", "response": ["He joined Conference Premier club Northwich Victoria on a one-month loan on 31 August 2007 to provide cover for the injured Lee Steele.

His first goal for Northwich came with the team's only goal in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Histon, before being substituted in the 79th minute with calf strain.
