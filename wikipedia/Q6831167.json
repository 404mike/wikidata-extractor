In 1934 he won a scholarship to Charterhouse, where he remained until the onset of World War II in 1939. He spent the war as a captain with the Westminster Dragoons, and was mentioned in dispatches. From 1946\u201349 he was a student of classics at University College, Oxford. In 1947 he married Jasmine Holmes, the daughter of his Charterhouse house master. From 1949\u201352 he was an assistant master at Uppingham School teaching classics. From 1952\u201359 he was an assistant master at Shrewsbury School teaching classics. From 1960\u201364 he was Headmaster of St Edmund's School, Canterbury.\nFrom 1964\u201371, he was Headmaster of Bradfield College. In 1971 he was named Headmaster of Harrow. He headed Harrow at a difficult time for British public schools generally, due to the political environment and financial pressures. Despite sometimes public criticism, Hoban responded with cost-saving measures, whilst refurbishing houses. During his tenure at Harrow, numbers slipped below 700 only three times. He oversaw many important building projects, including the new Central Feeding block; the New Knoll boarding house; and new physics and maths schools. He retired in 1981.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury School", "response": ["*Michael Hoban, assistant master, classics teacher, later headmaster of Bradfield College, St Edmund's School, Canterbury and Harrow School"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Michael Hoban, teacher (died 2003)"]}, {"page": "Bradfield College", "response": ["* Michael Hoban, headmaster 1964\u20131971, subsequently headmaster of Harrow School"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Michael Hoban (1921\u20132003), headmaster of Harrow School"]}, {"page": "2003 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Michael Hoban, teacher (born 1921)"]}, {"page": "Anthony Chenevix-Trench", "response": ["In November 1952, Chenevix-Trench spoke with Michael Hoban in opposition to a motion at the school Debating Society, proposed by the old boys and then Oxford undergraduates Michael Heseltine and Julian Critchley, that \"This House Deplores the Public School System\". Both the proposers poked fun at Chenevix-Trench's proclivity towards corporal punishment, and he defended the practice by suggesting that the alternatives had their own problems. The motion was carried by 105 votes to 95, and the tabloid newspapers made a great story from the outcome. Chenevix-Trench did not change his approach, nor did he object to the continuation of the tradition of fagging, nor that of older boys having the right to use corporal punishment on younger boys. In addition to his added organisational responsibilities as housemaster, he also continued both his close academic tutoring and carefree informality with the boys of School House. On 15 August 1953 he married Elizabeth Spicer, a primary school teacher whose brother he had known at Oxford. She took over some of the organisational work in School House, resulting in reports from the boys of great improvements in the quality of the food. Elizabeth gave birth to twin daughters, Laura and Jo, in October 1955. The couple's two sons, Richard and Jonathan, were born after he left Shrewsbury."]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in education", "response": ["*Michael Hoban (University) Headmaster St Edmund's School, Canterbury 1960\u201364, Bradfield 1964\u201371, Harrow 1971\u201381"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of University College, Oxford", "response": ["* Michael Hoban, headmaster of Harrow School"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2003", "response": ["*Michael Hoban, 81, British headmaster."]}, {"page": "Hoban, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Hoban"]}]}}
