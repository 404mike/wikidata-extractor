Many native names (such as lerreget-perreget) are onomatopoeic. The name \"cotton teal\" was used by Europeans near Bombay who noted that the bird had a lot of white feathers. They produce a low quacky call which has been likened to quacky duck, quacky duck or fixed bayonets (in British India).

He collected specimens during his travels in the Borabhum and Dholbhum area while serving as a lieutenant in the 31st regiment of native infantry. He called it Hirundo coronatus and gave it the trivial name of Dhudka Swallow. He noted that it was not found throughout the year. The genus Hemiprocne was erected by Christian Ludwig Nitzsch in 1829 but the species has variously been incorrectly treated in the past in Dendrochelidon and Macropteryx. Jerdon, a quinarian, considered the species to be a link between the swifts and swallows on the basis of their silky plumage, uncharacteristic of the swifts. James L. Peters considered coronata as a subspecies of longipennis but it was reinstated as a full species based on plumage and structural differences (Prigogine's delta or distance between the fourth and fifth tail feather) and distributions of this and longipennis in the restricted sense. Dillon Ripley described a new subspecies dryas from a specimen obtained by Salim Ali from Rajpipla in southern Gujarat. He considered it to be paler grey on the upperparts than the known forms. This is however no longer considered a valid subspecies and represents variation within the widely distributed species.
