Captain Jake Bidwell joined arch-rivals Queens Park Rangers for an undisclosed fee on 1 July. However, on the same day, Brentford also brought in three new players: Daniel Bentley, John Egan, and Romaine Sawyers after their contracts at their respective clubs expired. On 8 July, defender Jack O'Connell joined Sheffield United for an undisclosed fee. Later that day, Brentford kicked off their first pre-season friendly against Boreham Wood. A late Lewis Macleod header could not prevent defeat for the Bees as they lost 2\u20131. On 9 July, Brentford travelled to Germany for a 7-day pre-season training camp. During their time there, Brentford played VfL Bochum and won 1\u20130 thanks to a first half Scott Hogan goal. On 19 July, goalkeeper David Button joined local rivals Fulham for an undisclosed fee. Brentford continued their pre-season with a trip to Wycombe Wanderers. New signing Egan scored his first goal for the club before the break but Dayle Southwell equalised with a header in the second half, leaving the final score as 1\u20131. The first home game of the season was against 1. FC Kaiserslautern on 23 July. On a very hot day, Brentford took the lead after Alexander Ring inadvertently headed the ball into his own net in the second half. However, minutes later, Brentford conceded an equaliser from R\u00f3bert Pich to make the score 1\u20131. Just three days later, Brentford welcomed Peterborough United to Griffin Park. Paul Taylor scored for the Posh early on after a Tom Field mistake, but despite dominating the rest of the game, Brentford could not beat the opposition goalkeeper. On 30 July, Brentford announced the season-long loan of Callum Elder from Leicester City as a replacement for Bidwell at left back. Elder made his first appearance for the club in a testimonial match against Millwall to honour former captain Tony Craig. The match finished 1\u20131 after Yoann Barbet's early free kick was cancelled out by Steve Morison's header. Brentford's pre-season concluded with only one win from six matches.", "| Lewis Macleod"]}]}}
