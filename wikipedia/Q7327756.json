He and his older brother, Danny, grew up in the village of Bailiff Bridge, Brighouse near Halifax. Danny is the band's lead singer.\nRichard and Danny McNamara attended Hipperholme Grammar School in nearby Hipperholme with their brother Jonathan.According to Danny, as a child Richard was nicknamed 'Firestarter' as he was fascinated with fire and was always playing with a box of matches.McNamara was initially the drummer for a thrash metal garage band called Gross Misconduct in his teens. It is believed that Embrace began when his brother barged into a session and started telling him and his bandmates what to do.Although McNamara has worked with his brother in writing many of the band's songs, he only single-handedly sings a few songs. Most notably \"One Big Family\" and \"Hooligan\" which were both issued as singles; also \"I Want The World\" on the band's d\u00e9but album.\nIn 2018, McNamara (alongside Embrace members, Steve Firth, Mike Heaton and Mickey Dale) collaborated with Preston-based songwriter, Mark Whiteside [Evil Blizzard] under Whiteside\u2019s pre-existing solo project, One Sided Horse. An album [\u201cBetween Light and Space\u201d] was recorded and produced by Mickey Dale and released on UK Independent Label, Butterfly Effect.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Achill Island", "response": ["* Richard McNamara, musician"]}, {"page": "Ashes (Embrace song)", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "Make It Last", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "Wonder (Embrace song)", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "A Glorious Day", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "The Good Will Out", "response": ["In 1993, vocalist Danny McNamara and his brother, guitarist Richard McNamara, formed Embrace in the English town of Huddersfield. At the time, Richard was playing drums for the thrash metal band Gross Misconduct.Buckley ed. 2003, p. 337 After placing an ad in a local publication, the pair drafted Mike Heaton to  play drums. Following a handful of live shows, one of which earned an unfavourable piece in Melody Maker, the band took a break from performing to focus on writing material. They rehearsed for a while, prior to Richard McNamara finding a recording of \"Retread\" in Danny's set of demos. Bassist Steve Firth joined the others in 1996. Around this time, the band sent demos to potential managers and eventually settled with Tony Perrin.", "Musically, the sound of The Good Will Out has been described as Britpop and post-Britpop. It was compared to the works of Oasis and the Verve, which McNamara felt worked as \"good promotion\" for the release, but clarified that \"90% of 'The Good Will Out' was already written when these bands weren't even successful\". Wil Malone served as the conductor for a string section of the album, and Mickey Dale added keyboards to the recordings. While the album's booklet credits Dale with helping to arrange the strings, Richard McNamara said Craig Armstrong (who worked with Massive Attack at the time) had helped in that regard. The album's title is based on the proverb the truth will out, referring to being positive. It opens with the 40-second \"Intro\", which consists of a forty-piece orchestra setting up their instruments, ending with drum hits that segue into \"All You Good Good People\" featuring the orchestra. Danny McNamara thought the orchestra warming up \"sound[ed] incredible\", and ran into the studio's control room to have it recorded as the intro piece. He asked the orchestra to repeat what they had been doing; they could not remember and just improvised. On the second occasion the band worked with an orchestra, they had the tape rolling; the conductor can be heard filling out Musicians' Union forms. Dale described the piece as capturing the \"feel\" and \"all the excitement and ALL the nerves in the room\". He said \"All You Good Good People\" was the first time he had worked with the band; they required a string arrangement and had asked him for one. The track began originally as \"Mikes Fast\", and went through multiple versions before ending up in its final form. Varying tape noises can be heard, the result of the tape with McNamara's vocals being fast-forwarded and rewound.", "A song by Michelle Gayle partially influenced \"My Weakness Is None of Your Business\". The band intended holding back \"Come Back to What You Know\" for their second album until publicist Scott Piering heard the song and pushed for its release. McNamara said an earlier version of \"One Big Family\" was \"a lot more chaotic\", influenced by \"Naked Cousin (1996) by PJ Harvey. It features Richard McNamara on lead vocals and tambourine; the group vocals consist of friends, partners, and people from the street, under the name the Bricklayers.Citations for \"One Big Family\":", "* Richard McNamara on lead vocals: ", "* People from the street:  \"Higher Sights\" is a power ballad in the vein of INXS, and was inspired by \"You Do\" (1995) by McAlmont & Butler. Danny McNamara said he wrote the song after someone told the band they \"weren't [B]ritpop enough\". Dale said the string players  had struggled with the song as the scores were written in the wrong key; the players had to transpose the score while recording it. \"Retread\", a ballad, details the end of a relationship. The guitar riff was played on every guitar the band had before they settled on the final tone. \"I Want the World\" features the use of wah-wah pedals and feedback, and was compared to the work of Oasis. In its original form, the song sounded closer to the Jesus and Mary Chain; Richard McNamara attempted emulating Tim Burgess of the Charlatans.", "\"You've Got to Say Yes\" was about Heaton's best friend Dean who had an \"incredibly tough life\", and was influenced by the work of Curtis Mayfield. Initially, the song was called \"Shallow Time\", had a saxophone, and a section in 6/8 time. For \"Fireworks\", Danny McNamara sang a soul-esque rendition, before they added their instruments. The intro to \"The Last Gas\" is a snippet from a radio show about orangutans; it includes shouting by the Bricklayers. The album's final three tracks are piano-led pieces: \"That's All Changed Forever\", \"Now You're Nobody\" and \"The Good Will Out\". \"That's All Changed Forever\" was influenced by McNamara falling in love, and the effects love has on a person's life. The chorus was inspired after the band saw Superstar, who had a song with a similar sound. The lyrics include a reference to a conversation McNamara and Dale had at Heaton's house in 1995. With \"Now You're Nobody\", Dale said the band took a \"very Pet Sounds approach\", like quieting the drum and bass parts, and adding a lot of reverb. Richard McNamara said they dismantled a music box to sample its notes for the song. \"The Good Will Out\" was the result of combining two separate songs, and is reminiscent of \"Hey Jude\" (1968) by the Beatles. It had a verse from a different song initially, which Jazz Summers said needed re-working. They re-wrote the verse and eventually had the song's final form. Discussing the closing \"la-la-la\" section, McNamara said it was the \"most emotional moment during the recording [...] Think about it, everyone understands La-la-la\".", "All songs written by Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara.", "* Richard McNamara \u2013 guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals (tracks 5 and 8)"]}, {"page": "Drawn from Memory", "response": ["Drawn from Memory is the second album by English rock band Embrace, released on 27 March 2000 by Mobetta, Hut, and Virgin Records. Following the release of their debut studio album The Good Will Out (1998), touring keyboardist Mickey Dale became an official member. Frontman Danny McNamara began suffering from writer's block, leaving guitarist Richard McNamara to handle the writing. Sessions were done at Batsford Park Manor in Gloucestershire, Olympic Studios in London, and Soundworks Studios in Leeds. Tristin Norwell and the band producer the entire album, bar \"You're Not Alone\", which was produced by Hugo Nicolson. Songs on the album centred around the arrangements and the interplay between instruments, instead of being melody-driven.", "Embrace released their debut studio album The Good Will Out in June 1998. It peaked at number one in the UK; all of its singles charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"Come Back to What You Know\" reaching the highest at number six. \"All You Good Good People\" attracted minor attention from college radio in the United States. Prior to embarking on a tour of Europe at the end of 1998, touring keyboardist Mickey Dale was made an official member. Vocalist Danny McNamara suffered from writer's block, and as such, his brother, and the band's guitarist, Richard McNamara handling the majority of the songwriting.", "Drawn from Memory has been compared to Urban Hymns (1997) by the Verve. During the recording, the band were influenced by Nick Cave, Simon & Garfunkel, and jazz albums from the label Blue Note Records. The songs were based on the musical arrangements and how instruments interact with one another, instead of being driven by the melody. The orchestration throughout the album is more subdued than on The Good Will Out. The album opens with the country-soul ballad \"The Love It Takes\". Danny McNamara wrote it on an acoustic guitar during the making of The Good Will Out, before showing it to the rest of the band, who added music in the style of Frank Zappa. It slowly builds and ends with a guitar solo crescendo. Dale said the band wanted to open the album with a \"bold departure\" to separate it from The Good Will Out. \"You\u2019re Not Alone\" is a ballad that is reminiscent of The Good Will Out track \"Fireworks\", and the work of the Boo Radleys. Richard McNamara showed the band the song during the mixing of The Good Will Out, and nearly put it on that album, until their label pushed to release the album as-is. McNamara said they added the song to Drawn from Memory last as the label told the band they \"needed an Embracey track\".", "\"New Adam New Eve\" is a psychedelic track with Eastern-esque guitarwork that the band saw as their attempt to emulate \"Song 2\" (1997) by Blur. \"Hooligan\" is sung by Richard McNamara, features a kazoo solo, and is done in the vein of Beck and the Beta Band. Bassist Steve Firth said the band did not want a guitar solo as they felt \"they sound really cheesy\", so they opted for a kazoo. McNamara said the song dealt with peer pressure, as well as the \"happiness comes from focusing on what you have rather than what you don\u2019t have\". \"Yeah You\" channels the sound of Nirvana, specifically their track \"Pennyroyal Tea\" (1993). It was initially known as \"Pavement\". Danny McNamara recorded his vocals for \"Liars Tears\", another ballad, at the end of the garden at Batsford. \"I Wouldn't Wanna Happen to You\" is a psychedelic pop song with horns during the bridge section. Richard McNamara said it had a \"Midnight Cowboy vibe... all major sevenths for that summery vibe\". Danny McNamara compared the album's closing track, \"I Had a Time\", to The Good Will Out cut \"Retread\". His vocals were lifted from the demo version of the song; it features a clarinet part from drummer Mike Heaton.", "\"Hooligan\" was released as a single 1 November 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with \"I've Been Running\" and \"I Can't Feel Bad Anymore\", while the second included \"Like a Believer\" and \"With the One Who Got Me Here\". The music video for \"Hooligan\" sees Richard McNamara exploring the Thamesmead housing estate in London. In the weeks leading up to its release, \"Hooligan\" and its B-sides were made available for streaming through the band's website. In January 2000, the band went on a short tour of the United Kingdom. A documentary on the making of the album was broadcast on the band's website around this time. On 26 January 2000, Drawn from Memory was announced for release in two months' time. The band did a BBC Radio 1 session where they played \"Hooligan\", \"Save Me\", \"The Love It Takes\", and \"Yeah You\". The music video for \"You're Not Alone\" was posted on Dotmusic in 28 February 2000; it was filmed in Australia and sees the band doing outdoor activities, such as walking on a rope.", "All songs written by Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara.", "* Richard McNamara \u2013 guitar, vocals, kazoo, decks, percussion, loops"]}, {"page": "If You've Never Been", "response": ["Musically, the sound of If You've Never Been has been described as soft rock. Danny McNamara wrote the majority of the lyrics as guitarist Richard McNamara took a break to spend time with his newly born child. If You've Never Been features a heavier use of strings and horns compared to Drawn from Memory; the strings were performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, who were conducted by Will Jackson. The album opens with the sombre \"Over\", which discusses the end of a relationship, the initial feelings that result from it, and the eventual acceptance. Danny McNamara said \"Many Will Learn\" gad a \"lost at sea feel\" to it, which he compared to \"Now You're Nobody\", a track from their debut studio album The Good Will Out (1998). \"It's Gonna Take Time\" is an upbeat song that recalled the band's earlier works. The mid-tempo \"Hey, What You Trying to Say\" features a melodica; Danny McNamara said they tried using an harmonica, though it gave the song \"unwelcome \u2018Roseanne\u2019 feel\". \"If You've Never Been in Love with Anything\" evokes the work of the Kinks.", "All songs written by Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara.", "* Richard McNamara \u2013 guitar, vocals, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Hipperholme Grammar School", "response": ["* Richard McNamara, guitarist"]}, {"page": "All You Good Good People", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "Come Back to What You Know", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "My Weakness Is None of Your Business", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara"]}, {"page": "One Big Family", "response": ["\"One Big Family\" is a song by English band Embrace from their debut album The Good Will Out.
