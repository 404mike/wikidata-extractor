She published her first book of poetry Time and Chance in 1926 with the Hogarth Press of Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf; Gilbert Murray, philologist, wrote the introduction. The London antique dealer Maggs Bros Ltd has a copy Edwards dedicated to Irish publisher and book collector Alan Clodd, who in 1967 published her works with his Enitharmon Press. Individual poems subsequently appeared in Thomas Moult's The Best Poems of 1930, Art, Prose and Poetry, The Contemporary Review and The Living Age. She also published poetry between 1962 and 1964 in Literary Criticism Teaching edited by Margaret Willy for the Oxford University Press. In 1968 she published A Truce with Time and in 1978 Before and After, with poems in memory of her late partner, Judith Ackland: these poems, according to May Sarton, \"express the long-standing affection and solidarity of these two remarkable women and give strength to make unbearable bearable\". The volume was published by Enitharmon Press, as did Years Between (1982) and A Further Harvest (1985) with unpublished poems from the period between 1932 and 1984.", "thumb|Mary Stella Edwards and Judith Ackland at Bucks Mills, 1924", "* The Boston Marriage of Judith Ackland and Mary Stella Edwards: watercolourists and diorama makers, 20th Annual Lesbian Lives Conference, 15\u201316 February 2013, Brighton"]}, {"page": "Bideford Art School", "response": ["Among the artists who trained at Bideford are Allin Braund, who later taught at Hornsey School of Art in the 1930s, and Judith Ackland and Sheila Hutchinson; their work is part of the nearby Burton at Bideford's permanent collection.
