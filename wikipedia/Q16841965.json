She says that her work does not need to be understood, and that she often does not understand it herself. She purposefully films people who are aware that they are being filmed and act accordingly. This allows for an element of personification in her work mimicking a self portrait. Her artistic interests consist of architecture, fashion, textiles, and colour. All of her work illustrates her motif as isolated. Sometimes her compositions seem as if they were posed, and some of her other works look like she was at a great distance observing and recording. Her work is entangled with the idea of repetitive movement and minimal materiality. Lloyd's video instillations are made to be continuous with the intention of the start and end of the work being conditional upon the viewer.  She takes an unpolished, hands-on approach to filmmaking with her favourite medium being a mobile phone. Lloyd does not consider herself to be a filmmaker, rather an artist who uses film as a tool to create art. Her work encapsulates the wider temporal experience of the viewer with physical space playing an important role. Typically Lloyd will create an immersive experience for the viewer through this use of space, often influencing their movement through her art. The equipment that has been used to display her images include: monitors, projectors, stands, and cabling. Lloyd prefers to use versatile technological equipment in her work for both aesthetic purposes and convenience. In 2020, Dr James Fox made a personal tour of \u201csome of the most profound artworks from Tate Britain\u2019s collection\u201d for BBC television and included Lloyd\u2019s video piece, One Minute of Water, 1999.
