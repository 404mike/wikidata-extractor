From 1966 to 1970, he had a relationship with Marianne Faithfull, the English singer-songwriter/actress with whom he wrote \"Sister Morphine,\" a song on the Rolling Stones' 1971 album Sticky Fingers. He pursued a relationship with Marsha Hunt from 1969 to 1970. Jagger met the American singer and, though Hunt was married, the pair began a relationship in 1969.Ann Kolson, \"Marsha Hunt's Life is Filled with 'Joy': The Irrepressible Performer has Mick Jagger in her past, old ties to Philadelphia, and a New Book\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 16 February 1991. The relationship ended in June 1970, when Hunt was pregnant with Jagger's first child, Karis Hunt Jagger, born on 4 November 1970. Hunt is the inspiration for the song \"Brown Sugar\", also from Sticky Fingers."]}, {"page": "Rod Stewart", "response": ["Stewart became attracted to beatnik attitudes and left-wing politics, living for a while in a beatnik houseboat at Shoreham-by-Sea. He was an active supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at this time, joining the annual Aldermaston Marches from 1961 to 1963 and being arrested on three occasions when he took part in sit-ins at Trafalgar Square and Whitehall for the cause. He also used the marches as a way to meet and bed girls.Nelson and Bangs, Rod Stewart, p. 57. In 1962 he had his first serious relationship, with London art student Suzannah Boffey (a friend of future model and actress Chrissie Shrimpton); he moved to a bed-sit in Muswell Hill to be near her.Ewbank and Hildred, Rod Stewart: The New Biography, pp. 17\u201319. She became pregnant, but neither Rod nor his family wanted him to enter marriage; the baby girl was given up for adoption and Rod and Suzannah's relationship ended."]}, {"page": "Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)", "response": ["Within the Stones, tensions were rife as Brian Jones continued to be viewed by fans and the press as the band's leader, a situation that Jagger and Oldham resented.; . The group dynamics were also affected by some of the band members' romantic entanglements. Jones' new relationship with the German model Anita Pallenberg, which had taken on sadomasochistic aspects, helped renew his confidence and encourage him to experiment musically, while her intelligence and sophistication both intimidated and elicited envy from the other Stones. Jagger came to view his girlfriend, Chrissie Shrimpton, as inadequate by comparison; while Jagger sought a more glamorous companion commensurate with his newfound wealth, the aura surrounding Jones and Pallenberg contributed to the end of his and Shrimpton's increasingly acrimonious relationship.; . Richards' relationship with Linda Keith also deteriorated as her drug use escalated to include Mandrax and heroin. The band's biographer Stephen Davis describes these entanglements as a \"revolution under way within the Stones\", adding that \"Anita Pallenberg restored the faltering Brian Jones to his place in the band and in the Rolling Stones mythos. Keith Richards fell in love with her too, and their romantic triad realigned the precarious political axis within the Stones.\""]}, {"page": "Jill Gibson", "response": ["Arriving in London, England, Gibson, Cass Elliot, John Phillips, Denny Doherty, and Lou Adler rented the top half of a large house in Berkeley Square to work in (the downstairs part was rented to Mick Jagger and model Chrissie Shrimpton). Over the next three weeks Gibson rehearsed with the group in London for the recording of the band's upcoming second album and for a few live shows. While in England, the band had a series of business meetings, but still made time to party with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, and Mick Jagger at Dolly's (the private London rock club that catered to the stars). Upon returning to the United States, the group, their manager Bobby Roberts, their attorney Abe Somer, and their label Dunhill Records officially fired Michelle Phillips on Tuesday, June 28, 1966. Jill Gibson was hired two weeks earlier, just before the band left for England."]}, {"page": "Moon Zero Two", "response": ["* Chrissie Shrimpton as Boutique Attendant"]}, {"page": "Yesterday's Papers", "response": ["The song is supposedly directed at Jagger's ex-girlfriend Chrissie Shrimpton, whose relationship with Jagger at the time turned sour. It is noted for suggesting a negative treatment of women, comparing \"yesterday's girl\" to \"yesterday's papers\", as something that can be just thrown out, in similar fashion to a track on their previous album Aftermath, \"Under My Thumb\"."]}, {"page": "34 Montagu Square, Marylebone", "response": ["Richard-Hanbury Gurney, a banker and M.P. for Norwich, lived at No.\u00a034 in 1830.
