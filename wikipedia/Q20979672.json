Midfielder Michael Woods was invited back for pre-season training after a non-contract spell at the end of last season, but did not return and Oxford City full-back James Clarke was also invited for a pre-season trial. The first day of pre-season saw the signing of versatile left sided player Nathan Ralph following his release from Peterborough United and former Northampton Town winger Lewis Young. These two new players were supplemented by trialists including Clarke, Canadian goalkeeper Lucas Birnstingl, former Kilmarnock midfielder Ross Lindsay and former Southampton trainee Aarran Racine. On 4 July 2012, despite being half way through his two-year contract defender Bondz N'Gala left the club for fellow League One side Stevenage.

On 7 August, Yeovil faced their only pre\u2013season match against higher league opposition in the shape of Premier League side Stoke City. Yeovil took the lead through a Reuben Reid penalty with Stoke equalising through a Kenwyne Jones header nine minutes later and the match finished 1\u20131. With national press coverage for the squad photo publicity stunt, on 10 August, the club announced a deal had been agreed with W+S Recycling to be the club's new shirt sponsor, and on the same day it was announced that local Italian restaurant chain Tamburino's had agreed a deal to have their logo on the rear of Yeovil's shirts.
