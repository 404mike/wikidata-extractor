There was a political truce between the parties of the wartime coalition government, and the seat was expected to be filled without a contest. However, the party nominated Edmund Broughton Barnard, chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board to oppose the government candidate, Edward Smallwood. A third candidate, A Baker, was supported by the right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing and the Vigilante Society. The party did poorly, Barnard finishing in a distant third place with 513 votes (10.8%). The party held its inaugural meeting two days later and the president, Lord Beresford, declared himself \"delighted\" with the result which \"would have the effect of putting more grit into those who were fighting\" for the party."]}, {"page": "Islington East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward Smallwood", "*Liberal: Edward Smallwood"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Edward Smallwood"]}, {"page": "Hall Cross Academy", "response": ["* Edward Smallwood, Liberal MP from 1917\u201318 of Islington East"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["| Edward Smallwood", "| Edward Smallwood (resigned 10 December 1917)"]}, {"page": "1913 London County Council election", "response": ["| Edward Smallwood(resigned 10 December 1917)"]}, {"page": "1917 Islington East by-election", "response": ["Three names were put to the Islington East Liberals for consideration as candidate; Sir J Benn who was leader of the Progressives on the London County Council and a former Liberal MP,Marc Brodie, Sir John Williams Benn; \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" online; 2004-12 D S Waterlow, who was Liberal MP for Islington North from 1906-December 1910 and Edward Smallwood a coal manufacturer who represented the area on the London County Council and who was the successful applicant.The Times, 12 October 1917 p4", "thumb|120px|Edward Smallwood"]}, {"page": "Islington East (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=2| Edward Smallwood"]}]}}
