In 1534, Kildare being in prison in England and his son Silken Thomas, being in revolt, Skeffington was again appointed Deputy, at approximately 70 years of age.  Due to his age and ill-health, he was most reluctant to resume the office. He was also on the worst possible terms with his future successor as Lord Deputy, Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane, and their quarrels are said to have shortened Skeffington's life.  After some delay, he landed at Dublin in October 1534, and marched at once to relieve Drogheda, but further progress in the work of crushing the rebellion was seriously delayed by his illness. However, in the spring of 1535, he was again in the field. He took Maynooth Castle, killing and executing the entire garrison.
