He made his professional debut for the \"Dale\" after coming on as a 70th-minute substitute for D'Arcy O'Connor in a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle at Spotland Stadium on 27 April 2013. This was his only appearance of the 2012\u201313 season and he did not feature in the 2013\u201314 campaign as Rochdale secured promotion out of League Two. He broke into the first team at the start of the 2014\u201315 season, and signed a two-year contract extension in October 2014. Speaking the following month, manager Keith Hill said that Tanser was good enough to win England youth caps but that \"politics in football, the bureaucracy and the propaganda\" prevented lower league players from receiving a call-up. Tanser scored his first goal in senior football on 17 January 2015, opening the scoring with a \"well-controlled, left-foot volley\" as Rochdale recorded a 4\u20131 home victory over Crawley Town; he was named on the Football League team of the week. He ended the season with 30 League One appearances to his name."]}, {"page": "Darcy O'Connor", "response": ["#REDIRECT D'Arcy O'Connor"]}]}}
