He played a key role in defusing the crisis caused by the 1797 naval mutiny at Spithead. Members of his family were long influential in Portsmouth politics.\nThe eldest son of Susanna Pike and John Carter, a successful and respected merchant, John was baptised in the High Street Presbyterian (Unitarian) Chapel in Portsmouth. His parents, rational dissenters, refused to belong to the Church of England and, like both his grandfathers, were members of this chapel. In 1763, at 22, John was elected an alderman of the (then) borough of Portsmouth and, at the same time, started to act as a magistrate. He was mayor for a few months in 1769, but, as he was a Whig, the Tories soon turned him out of office. He was knighted on 22 June 1773, whilst again occupying the office.\nHis son John (1788\u20131838), a barrister and Member of Parliament for Portsmouth, changed his name to John Bonham-Carter to inherit from a cousin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*John Carter, Mayor of Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "John Carter", "response": ["John Carter may refer to:", "* John Carter (businessman) (born 1961/62), British businessman, CEO of Travis Perkins", "* John Carter (insurance executive) (born 1937), chairman of Commercial Union (1994\u20131998)", "* John Carter (author) (1905\u20131975), English author, book-collector and bookseller", "* John Carter (actor) (1927\u20132015), American actor and director", "* John Carter (sound engineer) (1907\u20131982), American film audio engineer", "* John Carter (film editor) (1922\u20132018), American film editor", "* John Carter (film), a 2012 film about the Burroughs character on Mars", "* Princess of Mars, a 2009 direct-to-DVD film retitled in 2012 to John Carter of Mars", "* John Carter, Warlord of Mars, a Marvel Comics series created in 1977", "* John Carter, Warlord of Mars (role-playing game), 1978", "* Carter (artist) (John Carter, born 1970), contemporary American artist", "* John Carter (mouth artist) (1815\u20131850), disabled English artist", "*John Carter (jazz musician) (1928\u20131991), American jazz musician", "*John Carter (musician) (born 1942), English singer-songwriter", "* John Carter of Mars, a character from the classic science fiction series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs", "* John Carter (ER), a character from the television series ER played by Noah Wyle", "* John Carter (Little House)", "*John Carter (Royal Navy officer) (1785\u20131863), Royal Navy officer during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars", "*John Carter (South Carolina politician) (1792\u20131850), U.S. Representative from South Carolina", "*John Carter (Texas politician) (born 1941), U.S. Representative from Texas", "*John Carter, U.S. Air Force veteran and candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in North Carolina in 2010", "*John Carter (died 1408), MP for Scarborough", "*John Carter (died 1432), MP for Scarborough", "*John Carter (Roundhead) (died 1676), English Parliamentary soldier and politician", "*John Carter (Mayor of Portsmouth) (1741\u20131808), English merchant and mayor", "*John Carter (Australian politician) (1893\u20131971), Australian politician", "*John Carter (New Zealand politician) (born 1950), New Zealand politician and mayor of the Far North District", "*John Carter (ambassador) (1919\u20132005), Guyanese politician, lawyer and diplomat", "* John Carter (Christadelphian) (1899\u20131962), editor of The Christadelphian from 1937 to 1962", "* John Carter (evangelist), Seventh-day Adventist evangelist", "*John Carter (cricketer, born 1935), former English cricketer", "*John Carter (cricketer, born 1963), former English cricketer", "*John Carter (ice hockey) (born 1963), professional ice hockey player", "* John Carter (architect) (1748\u20131817), English draughtsman and architect", "* John Carter (smuggler) (1770\u20131807), \"King of Prussia\", smuggler operating out of Prussia Cove, Cornwall", "* Lynching of John Carter (d. 1927), African-American man murdered by a white mob", "* John Carter (police officer) (1882\u20131944), Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, 1938\u20131940", "* John Carter (endocrinologist) (born 1944), Australian medical academic and endocrinologist", "* John Carter (1942\u20132000), founder of Carters Steam Fair"]}, {"page": "Bonham Carter family", "response": ["The Bonham Carter family are descendants of John Bonham-Carter (1788\u20131838), a British Member of Parliament and barrister, and his wife Joanna Maria Smith.
