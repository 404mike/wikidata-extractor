However, the pair soon after decided that they could pursue a similar dream of becoming international football coaches instead, and got in touch with former Pohnpei coach Charles Musana, who had coincidentally just moved to London and initially thought the pair's query was part of a prank. Following two years of negotiations with Micronesian sports officials, Watson was eventually offered the coaching job, and took up his new post in August 2009; he stated that because he \"had played to a reasonable standard in England\", they were convinced he could perform adequately in his new role. This made him the world's youngest international football coach, beating out previous record-holder Paul Crosbie by two years. However, the position was unpaid."]}, {"page": "Crosbie, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Crosbie"]}, {"page": "Paul Crosby", "response": ["* Paul Crosbie, football player and manager"]}]}}
