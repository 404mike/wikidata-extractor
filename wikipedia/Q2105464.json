All of the songs were composed between 1954 and 1958.Vaughan Williams Collected Songs in Three Volumes: Vol. 1 Oxford University Press, Great Britain. 1993. The cycle is best suited for mezzo-soprano, although, the original program note from the cycle's 1959 premiere acknowledges that all of the songs may be sung by a baritone, except for \"Hands, Eyes, and Heart\", \"which is a woman's song.\"Adams, Byron and Robin Wells, eds. Vaughan Williams Essays Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2003. pp. 157\u2013171.

L. Macy (Accessed 12 February 2008), However, there is debate in the scholarly community about this proposed song cycle grouping. Ren\u00e9e Ch\u00e9rie Clark in her essay, \"A Critical Appraisal of Four Last Songs\" suggests, citing a letter from the composer to a friend at Cornell University, that Vaughan Williams actually intended for \"Menelaus\" and \"Hands, Eyes, and Heart\" to be grouped together. The composer's death in 1958 left both cycles unfinished, and in 1960, they were assembled by the composer's widow, Ursula Vaughan Williams, and published as set by Oxford University Press. The texts of all four songs are poems written by Vaughan Williams' wife Ursula who penned several books of poetry throughout her lifetime as well as a biography of her late husband. \"Procris\" and \"Menelaus\" deal with figures from ancient Greek and Roman mythology and epic poetry while \"Tired\" and \"Hands, Eyes, and Heart\" depict images of love between a husband and wife.", "Piero di Cosimo's painting A Satyr Mourning Over a Nymph or The Death of Procris stirred Ursula Vaughan Williams to write her poem \"Procris.\" In ancient mythology, Procris, suspecting her husband Cephalus of having a secret lover, sneaks up on him while he hunts in the woods. Startled by noises behind him, he turns and shoots Procris with his bow. The song is written in a duple meter () and contains many shifts in tonality. While written in the key of G Major, the two beginning eleven-note descending motifs are more reminiscent of a G minor scale.
