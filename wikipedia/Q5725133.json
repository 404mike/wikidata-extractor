He was acknowledged as the first great lobby correspondent. Lucy wrote articles for Punch, Strand Magazine, The Observer, The New York Times and many others. He also wrote books detailing the workings of the Houses of Parliament and two autobiographies. He was Knighted in 1909. Lucy was widely known in the United Kingdom and in North America. President Woodrow Wilson said his articles in The Gentleman's Magazine inspired his mind and propelled him into public life. Lucy was a serious commentator of parliamentary affairs, but also an accomplished humourist and a parliamentary sketch-writer. His friend, the explorer Ernest Shackleton, named a mountain in Antarctica after him.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
