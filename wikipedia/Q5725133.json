He wrote for Punch, Strand Magazine, The Observer, The New York Times and many other papers. He also wrote books, detailing the workings of the Houses of Parliament and two autobiographies. He was knighted in 1909. Lucy was widely known also in North America. President Woodrow Wilson said Lucy's articles in The Gentleman's Magazine inspired his mind and propelled him into public life. Lucy was a serious parliamentary commentator, but also an accomplished humorist and a parliamentary sketch-writer. His friend, the explorer Ernest Shackleton, named a mountain in Antarctica after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hythe, Kent", "response": ["*Sir Henry Lucy was a parliamentary journalist who built (1883) 'Lucy's' on what is now Lucy's Hill in Hythe"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Henry Lucy, journalist, humourist, and parliamentary sketchwriter."]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury Chronicle", "response": ["Henry Lucy, later known as a political journalist under pen-name \"Toby, M.P.\", was chief reporter at the Chronicle in 1864."]}, {"page": "Henry Doetsch", "response": ["Henry Lucy, Faces and Places.
