Gangs controlled the clubs and the prostitutes, and the police were bribed. In 1960 London's first sex cinema, the Compton Cinema Club (a members-only club to get around the law), opened at 56 Old Compton Street. It was owned by Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser who later produced two early Roman Polanski films, including Repulsion (1965). As post-war austerity relaxed into the \"swinging '60s\", clip joints also surfaced; these unlicensed establishments sold coloured water as champagne with the promise of sex to follow, thus fleecing tourists looking for a \"good time.\" Harrison Marks, a \"glamour photographer\" and girlie magazine publisher, had a photographic gallery on Gerrard Street and published several magazines in the 1950s and '60s. The model Pamela Green prompted him to take up nude photography, and she remained the creative force in their business."]}, {"page": "Spielplatz", "response": ["Spielplatz has featured in TV and films such as Naked as Nature Intended (1961) starring club member Pamela Green, Nudist Memories (1959)  and  Confetti (2006)."]}, {"page": "Peeping Tom (1960 film)", "response": ["A psychiatrist is called to the set to console Diane.

She had measurements of 38\u201323\u201337."]}, {"page": "Harrison Marks", "response": ["Born in Tottenham, Middlesex in 1926, Marks was 17 when he married his first wife, Diana Bugsgang. He worked as a stand-up comedian in variety halls towards the end of the music hall era, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in a duo called Harrison and Stuart. Marks left the act in 1951 to develop his photographic career, taking pictures of music-hall performers and showgirls. The model and actress Pamela Green was performing as a dancer in a 1952 revue called Paris to Piccadilly, a version of the Folies Berg\u00e8re in London. She became Marks' lover and began working with him as a model. Their relationship ended in 1961 and he married his second wife Vivienne Warren in 1964.", "In the 1950s Marks and Pamela Green opened a photographic studio at 4 Gerrard Street, Soho. Marks provided nude photographs for photographic magazines on a freelance basis as well as selling his own stills directly. With the profits from this work, they launched Kamera magazine in 1957. Kamera featured Marks' glamour photography of nude women taken in the small studios or Marks' kitchen. Marks' 1958 publicity materials contained one of the first uses of the word \"glamour\" as a euphemism for nude modelling/photography. The magazine was an immediate success and the business expanded to employ around seventeen staff by the early 1960s, selling a number of other magazine titles such as Solo, postcards and calendars, and distributing imported French books and glamour magazines. Photographic exhibitions were held at the Gerrard Street studio.", "In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films of his models undressing and posing topless, for the 8 mm film market. These were popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". His films were available over the counter at camera shops, and also supplied discreetly by mail order from the back pages of his Kamera magazine. One Marks 8mm glamour film was The Window Dresser (1961), in which Pamela Green starred as a cat burglar who hides from the law by posing as a display mannequin in a lingerie shop. Marks appears in the film as the shop's owner; Green performs a striptease in the store's display window. Clips from The Window Dresser were used in a 1964 piece on the glamour film scene in the Rediffusion programme This Week. These clips showed Pamela Green fully unclothed; the ensuing controversy resulted in Green having to defend the film on the BBC Light Programme's Woman's Hour.David McGillivray Doing Rude Things: The History of the British Sex Film 1957\u20131981, Sun Tavern Fields Books, 1992 After a judge threw out an obscenity charge against The Window Dresser, Marks continued to make 8\u00a0mm glamour films throughout the 1960s.", "One such film, Witches Brew (1960) features Pamela Green as a witch casting spells; Marks makes a brief appearance as her hunchback assistant. In another, Model Entry (1965), a cat burglar breaks into Marks' studio, strips and leaves him her address. In Danger Girl, a stripping secret agent is put into bondage by a Russian spy; the agent breaks free, ultimately throwing her captor onto a circular saw. Even more macabre is Marks' Perchance to Scream (1967) in which a model is transported to a medieval torture chamber. In this film, Stuart Samuels plays an evil inquisitor who sentences topless women to be whipped and beheaded by a masked executioner.", "Based at Marks' Farringdon studio, Maximus was run on a \"film club\" basis, meaning that clients would have to sign up for membership before purchasing the films, mirroring the way membership-only sex cinemas were run at the time. While his earlier 8mm films largely consisted of nothing more explicit than the models posing topless, late-sixties titles like Apartment 69 and The Amorous Masseur were generally softcore pornography. Marks had been eager to shoot soft porn material ever since the Window Dresser case, much to the disdain of Pamela Green, who dissolved their business partnership in 1967. \"He was fond of good living and a drink or two, and he wanted to go on to soft porn,\" Green told Tit-Bits magazine in 1995, adding \"there was this one film where he was dressed as a dirty old man and he's creeping round Piccadilly Circus, then you see him in bed with this girl\".David Flint \"Peeping at Pamela\", Tit-Bits, 1995 One Maximus short The Ecstasy of Oral Love adopts a pseudo-documentary format, showing a couple frantically licking each other, ending with some relatively graphic oral sex scenes which are inter-cut with ostensibly socially redeeming title cards issuing advice to \"young married couples\"."]}, {"page": "This Week (1956 TV programme)", "response": ["In September 1958, This Week filmed George Harrison Marks and Pamela Green at their photography studio in Gerrard Street.

The film sequence ended with a montage of their photographs, mostly of nudes. However, the night it was to be broadcast Pope Pius XII died and the programme was cut, and the interview never shown. In 1964, This Week returned to their studio. This time round they showed a clip of the infamous striptease comedy film The Window Dresser."]}, {"page": "Nudity in film", "response": ["Exploitation producer George Weiss also released films such as Nudist Life (1961), which comprised vintage nudist camp footage.

She undoes her top briefly exposing one of her breasts. The scene is regarded as the first female nude scene in a mainstream postwar English-language feature film, and notably the first such scene for a British film. The movie was panned by critics at the time and it reportedly destroyed Powell's directing career in the UK. The film is now seen as a cult classic; Martin Scorsese re-released it in 1979. Another 1960 release, the American horror film Macumba Love, featured a brief topless scene of June Wilkinson frolicking in the ocean.
