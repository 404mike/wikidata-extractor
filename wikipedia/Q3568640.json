It is not known how much Johnson contributed to Tom's character or his adventures. William Fulke referred to Tom in 1579 in Heskins Parleament Repealed, and Thomas Nashe referred to him in 1592 in his prose satire on the vices of the age Pierce Penniless, His Supplication to the Divell. Reginald Scot listed Tom in his Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584) as one of the creatures used by servant maids to frighten children, along with witches, dwarfs, elves, fairies, giants, and other supernatural folk."]}, {"page": "Douay\u2013Rheims Bible", "response": ["The purpose of the version, both the text and notes, was to uphold Catholic tradition in the face of the Protestant Reformation which up until the time of its publication had dominated Elizabethan religion and academic debate. As such it was an effort by English Catholics to support the Counter-Reformation. The New Testament was reprinted in 1600, 1621 and 1633. The Old Testament volumes were reprinted in 1635 but neither thereafter for another hundred years. In 1589, William Fulke collated the complete Rheims text and notes in parallel columns with those of the Bishops' Bible. This work sold widely in England, being re-issued in three further editions to 1633. It was predominantly through Fulke's editions that the Rheims New Testament came to exercise a significant influence on the development of 17th-century English.Reid, G. J. \"The Evolution of Our English Bible\", The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXX, 1905.", "thumb|Title Page of the Rheims New Testament alongside the first page of the Gospel According to Matthew from the Bishop's Bible, 1589, edited by William Fulke, who believed the Bishop's Bible New Testament was superior to the Rheims New Testament.", "In England the Protestant William Fulke unintentionally popularized the Rheims New Testament through his collation of the Rheims text and annotations in parallel columns alongside the 1572 Protestant Bishops' Bible. Fulke's original intention through his first combined edition of the Rheims New Testament with the so-called Bishop's Bible was to prove that the Catholic-inspired text was inferior to the Protestant-influenced Bishop's Bible, then the official Bible of the Church of England. Fulke's work was first published in 1589; and as a consequence the Rheims text and notes became easily available without fear of criminal sanctions. ", "The Old Testament \"Douay\" translation of the Latin Vulgate arrived too late on the scene to have played any part in influencing the King James Version.As noted in Pollard, Dr Alfred W. Records of the English Bible: The Documents Relating to the Translation and Publication of the Bible in English, 1525\u20131611, London, Oxford University Press, 1911. The Rheims New Testament had, however, been available for over twenty years. In the form of William Fulke's parallel version, it was readily accessible. Nevertheless, the official instructions to the King James Version translators omitted the Rheims version from the list of previous English translations that should be consulted, probably deliberately."]}, {"page": "Early Modern English Bible translations", "response": ["The version's English was not colloquial, but ecclesiastical and highly latinate. In Hebrews 13:17, the version reads, \"Obey your prelates and be subject unto them.\" In Luke 3:3, John came \"preaching the baptism of penance.\" In Psalm xxiii:5, where the King James Version reads, \"My cup runneth over,\" the Douai version, taking its cue from the Greek Septuagint, reads, \"My chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly it is.\" There is a retention of ecclesiastical terms, and an explanation of the passages on which Protestants tended to differ rather sharply from Roman Catholics, as in the matter of the taking of the cup by the people, and elsewhere.  In 1589, the Protestant scholar William Fulke issued a point by point refutation of the notes of the Rheims New Testament, in which he also printed the biblical text both of Rheims and of the Bishop's Bible in parallel columns. This work, which sold very widely, had the consequence of making the Rheims New Testament much more accessible than would otherwise have been the case."]}, {"page": "Sevenoaks School", "response": ["* Sevenoaks Schoolmaster William Painter introduced his translation of William Fulke's Antiprognosticon (1560) with a letter written from Sevenoaks."]}, {"page": "Fulk", "response": ["*William Fulke (1538\u20131589), English Puritan divine"]}, {"page": "William Painter (author)", "response": ["Painter had at least one contemporary namesake.
