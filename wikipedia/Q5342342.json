Plants produced from the still-surviving (then 180-year-old) tree by tissue culture in 1990 have proved to be much more compact and free-branching than the widely available commercial stock. The cloning work was done by scientists at the University of Nottingham, including Professor Edward Cocking, because the original tree was suffering from old age and was under attack by honey fungus. Twelve of the cloned trees now grow in the University grounds; one was also planted beside the old tree at Southwell, but was cut down when it was 10 years old.Science Daily website: \"Turning back the clock to save the Bramley apple\" (3 April 2009) accessed 17 January 2010"]}, {"page": "Cocking", "response": ["* Edward Cocking (born 1931), British plant scientist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1983", "response": ["#Edward Cocking"]}, {"page": "Edward Charles Daniel Cocking", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Cocking"]}]}}
