An unusual example of body doubling took place in the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. A scene requiring Linda Hamilton to appear as two Sarah Connors in the same scene was created by employing Hamilton's identical twin sister Leslie as her double. This has become less common with digital editing currently available which can splice together multiple takes, allowing for an actor to perform as each character in separate takes that are joined together to create the image of the characters in same setting, such as with Deep Roy, who portrayed the Oompa-Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."]}, {"page": "Mindwarp", "response": ["Deep Roy, who had previously played Mr. Sin in The Talons of Weng-Chiang, has an uncredited role as the Posicarian delegate.

The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.", "Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Rather than using computer-generated environments, Burton primarily used built sets and practical effects, which he claimed was inspired by the book's emphasis on texture. Wonka's Chocolate Room was constructed on the 007 Stage at Pinewood, complete with a faux chocolate waterfall and river. Squirrels were trained from birth for Veruca Salt's demise. Actor Deep Roy performed each Oompa-Loompa individually rather than one performance duplicated digitally.", "* Deep Roy as Oompa-Loompas (with vocal work by Danny Elfman)", "Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. \"Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots\u2014all they do is work, work, work,\" Roy commented. \"So when it comes time to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps.\" Roy, who played a total of 165 individual Oompa-Loompas in the film, experienced an especially laborious regimen during production. He was required to regularly practice Pilates with a personal trainer and follow a diet in order for his appearance to remain unchanged during filming. With no prior professional dancing experience, each musical number involving Roy took a month to rehearse and six months in total to film. In referencing his workload during production, Burton called Roy the \"hardest-working man in show biz.\"", "The first song composed was \"Augustus Gloop\", being done as a Bollywood spectacle per Deep Roy's suggestion. Elfman recounted, \"my original approach was to find a style of music and apply that to all the songs. Tim was like, 'No, no, no, no, no... we're going to completely mix it up!' I said, 'Great, let's go.'\" Per Burton's suggestion, the Oompa-Loompa songs would each reflect a different style of music: \"Violet Beauregarde\" is 1970s funk, \"Veruca Salt\" is 1960s bubblegum and psychedelic pop, and \"Mike Teavee\" is a tribute to late-1970s hard rock, particularly Queen, and early 1980s hair bands. All four songs utilize lyrics direct from Roald Dahl's book; as such, the lyrics are credited to Dahl. Rather than using the book's songs in their entirety, Elfman selected specific verses, as he believed using them unabridged would've made each song ten minutes long. \"Violet Beauregarde\" was the only song that required a partial rewrite, as the song in the book was about a girl who chewed gum rather than Violet Beauregarde herself. The only other song to require vocal performances was \"Wonka's Welcome Song\", a maddeningly cheerful theme park ditty, which was written in collaboration with the film's screenwriter John August.", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released on VHS and DVD on November 8, 2005. The single-disc version of the film included only two special features: an Oompa-Loompa dance tutorial and \"Becoming Oompa-Loompa\", which documented Deep Roy's experience on the production. A two-disc edition was also released which included six more behind the scenes featurettes: \"Chocolate Dreams\", exploring the writing and Tim Burton's vision for the film; \"Different Faces, Different Flavors\", exploring the characters; \"Designer Chocolate\", detailing the production design and costumes; \"Sweet Sounds\", how Danny Elfman created the Oompa-Loompa songs; \"Under the Wrapper\", detailing the film's practical and digital effects; and \"Attack of the Squirrels\", exploring how real squirrels were utilized for Veruca Salt's demise. The two-disc edition also contained several games and DVD-Rom features.", "A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave a positive review, writing \"in spite of relapses and imperfections, a few of them serious, Mr. Burton's movie succeeds in doing what far too few films aimed primarily at children even know how to attempt anymore, which is to feed\u2014even to glut\u2014the youthful appetite for aesthetic surprise.\" Scott also praised Alex McDowell's set design, comparing the look of the factory to something out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's \"best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor.\" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that \"Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack.\""]}, {"page": "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes", "response": ["* Emil Abossolo-Mbo and Deep Roy \u2013 additional ape performers"]}, {"page": "Corpse Bride", "response": ["* Deep Roy as General Bonesapart, a diminutive skeleton in a military uniform with a sword stuck in his chest.
