Andrew Plimer (1763\u20131837) was a pupil of Cosway, and both he and his brother Nathaniel Plimer produced some lovely portraits. The brightness of the eyes, wiriness of the hair, exuberance of colour, combined with forced chiaroscuro and often very inaccurate drawing, are characteristics of Andrew Plimer's work. John Smart (c. 1740 1811) was in some respects the greatest of the 18th-century miniaturists. His work was hailed by contemporaries for his excellence in refinement, power and delicacy; its silky texture and elaborate finish, and the artists love for a brown background. Other notable painters were Richard Crosse (1742\u20131810), Ozias Humphry (1742\u20131810), Samuel Shelley (c1750\u20131808), whose best pictures are groups of two or more persons, Henry Edridge (1769\u20131821), John Bogle, and Edward Dayes.", "thumb|Portrait of a Member of the Tayler Family in 1787, by John Smart. Smart painted similar miniatures for British Soldiers in India during the late 18th century. |alt=|163x163px", "The portrait miniature was also used as a tool for notoriety, respect, and promotion especially for the British in Colonial India. Young soldiers sent to India were often done so under the impression that their tour of duty would elevate their status in society, secure a promotion, and prepare them for marriage upon their return. The climate in British occupied India proved to be harsh on complexion and many in British society regarded the physical change harshly. Young men had their portrait commissioned upon arrival to India for mothers, sisters, and spouses to prove that their health and safety were of no concern. The portraits were commissioned by the soldiers to send back to families, many of the portrait miniatures were created by British artists temporarily in India. One such artist was John Smart. Smart spent 1785-1795 in Madras where he was highly sought after by British soldiers. Portrait miniatures commissioned in Colonial India made from ivory are very different from the ones created with canvas and oil; not only due to the cost of the commission themselves but also due to the fragility and risk of packing and shipment. Shipment of ivory portrait miniatures were often taxed more heavily because of the higher risk of damage or loss. Due to the importance placed on status and the cost of shipping, many scholars have concluded the portrait miniatures not only point to the new methods of artistry but also the cultural history of the portrait miniature in Colonial India."]}, {"page": "George Engleheart", "response": ["George Engleheart (1750\u20131829) was one of the greatest English painters of portrait miniatures, and a contemporary of Richard Cosway, John Smart, William Wood, and Richard Crosse."]}, {"page": "1740 in art", "response": ["** John Smart, English painter of portrait miniatures (died 1811)"]}, {"page": "Oriental Club", "response": ["The club possesses a fine collection of paintings, including many early portraits of Britons in India such as Warren Hastings.Tully, Mark, Why Queen Victoria\u2019s art reflects her true feelings about India, online at dawn.com (accessed 28 January 2008) The Bar is overlooked by a painting of Tippu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore (1750\u20131799).
