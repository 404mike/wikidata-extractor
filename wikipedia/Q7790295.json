Attending was Cyrus Avery, an AASHO committee leader representing the state of Oklahoma and a proponent of the Chicago to Los Angeles route. Avery disagreed with Fields' complaint and stated the US\u00a060 designation should remain on the Chicago Los Angeles route. Following the meeting, the Executive Committee decided to retain the US\u00a060 designation for the Chicago to Los Angeles route, taking the side of Avery. The Committee however, did attempt to rectify Kentucky's complaints by extending the eastern terminus of the proposed US\u00a062 from its endpoint in West Virginia near Ashland to Newport News, Virginia. US\u00a062 would also be extended from Ozark to Springfield, Missouri. Fields was not pleased with the US\u00a062 extension and continued to campaign for US\u00a060 to be routed through Kentucky. Fields later returned to AASHO with support from Kentucky's Congressional delegation and presented his argument to AASHO's chairman Thomas H. MacDonald on January 25, 1926. MacDonald agreed with Fields' argument and AASHO subsequently exchanged the number of the Los Angeles to Chicago route with the Newport News to Springfield route."]}, {"page": "List of British films before 1920", "response": ["| In the Hands of London Crooks || Alexander Butler || Thomas H.
