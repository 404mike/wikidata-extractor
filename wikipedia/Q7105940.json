According to V. Klima, K. F. Ruzicka, and P. Zima, \"His range of ideas is rather limited. He repeatedly praises his native country's march towards freedom, but presents his ideas in variegated, fantastic images.\" Senghor wrote that Bolamba's poetry was more focused on articulating imagery than espousing ideas. He considered Bolamba to be a N\u00e9gritude poet. Klima, Ruzicka, and Zima disagreed, writing \"the philosophy and pathos of the Dakar intellectuals are rather remote from Bolamba's way of thinking. He has chosen his own, independent path and only the ideology of post-World War II African nationalism can be said to link him to the N\u00e9gritude writers.\" Franco-Senegalese poet David Diop believed Esanzo contained nonpolitical poetry and suggested that Bolamba, though aware of the N\u00e9gritude movement, avoided engaging the highly politicised style out of \"prudence\". Guyanese critic Oscar Dathorne praised the lyricism of Esanzo and noted the theme of protest against injustice in the work Chant du soir (Evening Song), but concluded that Bolamba was only \"a minor African poet who utilised some of the techniques of the N\u00e9gritude poets.\" Africanist scholar Willfried Feuser said, \"Bolamba's Chant du soir is quite charming, but...his imagery lacks the power and density of his fellow-Congolese from the Brazzaville side of the river, Felix Gerard Tchicaya U Tam'si.\" Donald E. Herdeck wrote, \"Bolamba's poetry is often slack and full of trite expressions. Though intensely patriotic, his work generally is not impressive, for it offers neither genuine passion nor visions of a convincing reality.\""]}, {"page": "O. R.
