Yisrael Baal Shem Tov began his activity as a traditional Baal Shem, before founding Hasidism. While the association of the Maharal of Prague (1520\u20131609) with the creation of a golem only emerged in later times, contemporary tradition records Elijah Baal Shem as creating a golem. The Sabbatean mystical heresies of Sabbatai Zevi (1626\u20131676) and Jacob Frank (1726\u20131791) led to the 1750s accusation of Jonathan Eybeschutz by Jacob Emden of being a secret Sabbatean. It was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden saw Sabbatean allusions. The leader of Mitnagdic Lithuanian Judaism, the Kabbalist Vilna Gaon (1720\u20131797), related that in his youth he had attempted to make a golem, but stopped when he perceived a spirit of impurity involved.The Vilna Gaon: The Life and Teachings of Rabbi Eliyahu the Gaon of Vilna, ArtScroll History publications, Betzalel Landau and Yonason Rosenblum"]}, {"page": "Baal Shem Tov", "response": ["==Confusion with Baal Shem of London==", "A portrait by John Singleton Copley is often mistaken to be that of Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, also known as the Baal Shem Tov.
