He came to the fore in 1896 with 85 wickets, took 120 in 1897 and then 101 in 1898. But in 1899, he fell away, with only 65 wickets and the following year, after seven matches in which he took only five wickets, he took a job in Blackburn, Lancashire and left the first-class game. He resigned from his assistant secretary role with the club in 1901.There was one brief comeback. In 1905, five years after his final game for Essex, Bull played for Scotland against the Australian touring team. He took eight wickets in the match, with five for 58 runs in the Australians' second innings. Bull would appear in the amateur Lancashire league in 1907 for East Lancashire.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1897 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Frederick Bull, Willis Cuttell, Frank Druce, Gilbert Jessop, Jack Mason"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Frederick Bull"]}, {"page": "1897 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden \u2013 Frederick Bull, Willis Cuttell, Frank Druce, Gilbert Jessop, Jack Mason  ", "|Frederick Bull || Essex || 16 || 4365 || 109 || 20.38"]}, {"page": "Sam Kilburn", "response": ["Born in Dalton Fold, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, Kilburn was a right-handed batsman, who scored 8 in his only innings before being bowled by Walter Mead, and did not bowl or take a catch.
