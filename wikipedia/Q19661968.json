After riding for the Matrix Fitness Pro Cycling team for four seasons, she joined the RST Racing Team in May 2015. However, in June 2015 she joined Servetto Footon for the remainder of the 2015 season. In October 2016 she announced that she would take a break from racing in the 2017 season after her time with Servetto Footon, which she described as \"frustrating\" and \"demoralising\" due to a lack of support from the team, stating that she had not been paid by them, and had depended on financial support from the Dave Rayner Fund. After splitting from Servetto Footon, she joined Team WNT as soigneur for 2017, before moving on to studying art and design at the end of the season.She is the daughter of racing cyclist Chris Walker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walker (surname)", "response": ["*Jessie Walker (born 1994), English cyclist"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Jessie Walker"]}, {"page": "List of professional sports families", "response": ["| Jessie Walker"]}, {"page": "Chris Walker (cyclist)", "response": ["He retired in 2000 at the age of 35 and is now a product designer for RST Clothing.Chris Walker: British Legend 29-Jan-2013 He is the father of racing cyclist Jessie Walker."]}, {"page": "Matrix Fitness Pro Cycling", "response": ["For the 2015 season the team signed track World Champions, Elinor Barker and Laura Trott from rival British team .
