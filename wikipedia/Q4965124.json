However, in the next two seasons he struggled for consistency. Against Glamorgan in 1964 he suffered the miserable experience of a king pair (falling to the first ball of each innings) in one day, to Ossie Wheatley each time.Scorecard: Glamorgan v Northamptonshire in 1964 CricketArchive.

Watts asked to be released in 1966; but he was fit enough to set a new Northants County League record two years later, claiming 10\u201310 for Rushden against Kettering. Twice he took on the captaincy in very difficult circumstances, and twice he left the side in an immeasurably better state than he found it. In the autumn of 1970, Northamptonshire faced the future without the services of Roger Prideaux, Brian Reynolds and Albert Lightfoot, and with Mushtaq Mohammad expected to miss a good part of the following summer on tour with Pakistan. Watts, only back at Wantage Road for a season after three years out of the county game, was the committee's choice to take charge. The 1971 season was the first as captain and marked it with 1,311 runs, and the following August led Northamptonshire to a hugely satisfying seven-wicket victory over Ian Chappell's Australians.  'The better side won'  observed secretary Ken Turner. It was, for Watts,  'the greatest moment since I became captain.'  Northamptonshire finished fourth, third and third again in the Championship before Watts handed over the baton to concentrate on his teaching career. Another highlight before he resigned was the 59-run John Player League triumph over one-day specialists Lancashire in 1974, it was Watts' benefit match and he marked the occasion with 61 runs."]}, {"page": "Brian Reynolds", "response": ["Brian Reynolds may refer to:", "* Brian Reynolds (game designer) (born 1967), American strategy game designer", "* Brian Reynolds (cricketer) (1932\u20132015), English professional cricketer", "* Brian Reynolds (RAF officer) (1902\u20131965), British air marshal", "* Brian Reynolds Myers (born 1963), professor of international studies in South Korea"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Brian Reynolds, 82, cricketer (Northamptonshire)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2015", "response": ["*Brian Reynolds, 82, English cricketer (Northamptonshire).Cricket: Northamptonshire legend Brian Reynolds passes away aged 82"]}]}}
