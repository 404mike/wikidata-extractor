The sub-committee concluded that parliamentary opinion would not favour this suggestion. Likewise, in December 1938 the Commons rejected a motion from the Prime Minister for a Select Committee to re-examine the idea. The sub-committee, chaired by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, reported in April 1939 that no change should be made; permitting opposition to a sitting speaker would be \"a serious infringement of democratic principles\" and that \"to alter the status of the speaker, so that he ceased to be returned to the House of Commons by the same electoral methods as other members or as a representative of a Parliamentary constituency, would be equally repugnant to the custom and tradition of the House\".\"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Elections (Mr. Speaker's Seat)\", House of Commons Paper 98, 1938\u201339 Session, HM Stationery Office 1939."]}, {"page": "Duke of Grafton", "response": ["*Charles Alfred Euston FitzRoy, 10th Duke of Grafton (1892\u20131970), eldest son of the Rev.
