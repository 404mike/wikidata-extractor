Along with Diana Beauclerk (1734\u20131808) and Elizabeth Templetown (1747\u20131823), she contributed designs in \"Romantic style\" to Josiah Wedgwood for reproduction in his studio in Rome. She was the daughter of John Crewe, 1st Baron Crewe and his wife Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe.\nCrewe was criticised in Richard Polwhele's The Unsex'd Females, for having painted the Frontispiece to Erasmus Darwin's The Loves of the Plants: \"There is a charming delicacy in most of the pictures of Miss Emma Crewe; though I think, in her \"Flora at play with Cupid,\" \u2026 she has rather overstepped the modesty of nature, by giving the portrait an air of voluptuousness too luxuriously melting.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
