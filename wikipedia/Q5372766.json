Along with Diana Beauclerk (1734\u20131808) and Elizabeth Templetown (1747\u20131823), she contributed designs in \"Romantic style\" to Josiah Wedgwood for reproduction in his studio in Rome. She was the daughter of John Crewe, 1st Baron Crewe and his wife Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe.\nCrewe was criticised in Richard Polwhele's The Unsex'd Females, for having painted the Frontispiece to Erasmus Darwin's The Loves of the Plants: \"There is a charming delicacy in most of the pictures of Miss Emma Crewe; though I think, in her \"Flora at play with Cupid,\" \u2026 she has rather overstepped the modesty of nature, by giving the portrait an air of voluptuousness too luxuriously melting.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wedgwood", "response": ["*Aristocratic ladies who produced designs, many in a softer \"Romantic\" version of Neoclassical style, were Lady Elizabeth Templetown, Emma Crewe and Lady Diana Beauclerk; these were also mostly for jasperware reliefs.Young, 32, 41, 55  "]}, {"page": "The Unsex'd Females", "response": ["The poem betrays a particular animus for Mary Wollstonecraft and, by extension, others Polwhele considered to be of her radical, pro-French camp: writers Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Mary Robinson, Charlotte Turner Smith, Helen Maria Williams, Ann Yearsley, Mary Hays and Ann Jebb, and artists Angelica Kauffman and Emma Crewe. Strangely, perhaps, only Hays, Jebb and Smith shared political sympathies with Wollstonecraft, and Smith, by 1798, had turned her back on her previous ideas. The others, though, in different ways, all fell afoul of restrictive ideas of female (and class) decorum. Yearsley, for example, a labouring-class poet who had a dispute with her patron, Hannah More, is accused of longing \"to rustle, like her sex, in silk\" (l.102). According to one editor, \"one can only conclude that Polwhele attacks these women not for what they are, but for what they are not: they are unsexed, unfeminine, either because they are immodest, or unsentimental, or insubordinate. Women must do more than simply avoid setting a bad example: they must provide a positive model of chaste, sentimental, subordinate femininity.\"Introduction , The Unsex'd Females, Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library. See also William Stafford, English Feminists and Their Opponents in the 1790s: unsex'd and proper females (Manchester University Press, 2002) for the argument that Polwhele and other Anti-Jacobin critics were inconsistent, approving the public speech of their female allies while deploring the same activities in their opponents. Of this transgressive group, Polwhele invites the reader:", "In The Unsex'd Females, Polwhele initially seems to divide women writers according to their sexual reputations, but a closer examination reveals that he positions them largely symbolically. Why, for example, would Emma Crewe be in Wollstonecraft's group while Diana Beauclerk is in More's, particularly as the two knew each other and worked together? Beauclerk, in fact, had her own scandalous history: divorced by her husband for adultery, revealed to have had a child by her lover while still married, she was hardly a \"proper lady.\" She was, however, a well-connected, well-established member of the aristocracy who painted charming, decorative pieces. Hannah More herself, while hardly a revolutionary, held a number of ideas uncannily similar to those of Wollstonecraft, ideas about the importance of female education, for example.Literary scholar Mitzi Myer has argued that the political binaries of \"conservative\" and \"progressive,\" \"left\" and \"right,\" do not always apply in the 18th century. Mitzi Myers, \"Reform or Ruin: 'A Revolution in Female Manners,'\" Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture 11 (1982): 199\u2013216. Polwhele's polemical structure is not concerned with these nuances, however, and he positions these writers strictly according to his overarching scheme."]}, {"page": "Lady Diana Beauclerk", "response": ["She illustrated a number of literary productions, including Horace Walpole's tragedy The Mysterious Mother, the English translation of Gottfried August B\u00fcrger's Leonora (1796) and The Fables of John Dryden (1797). After 1785 she was one of a circle of women, along with Emma Crewe and Elizabeth Templetown (1746/7-1823), whose designs for Josiah Wedgwood were made into bas-reliefs on jasper ornaments."]}, {"page": "John Crewe, 1st Baron Crewe", "response": ["* Emma Crewe, who married Foster Cunliffe-Offley."]}, {"page": "Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe", "response": ["In 1766, Frances married John Crewe, who became Baron Crewe.
