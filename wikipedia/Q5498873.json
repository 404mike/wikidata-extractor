The land was flat and unpromising as a garden site, but the layout was planned with great skill, utilizing an old gravel pit to construct a lake with a high mound running into it. Trees and shrubs were planted according to their botanical sequence, a range of glasshouses was built in the 1860s, and a rock garden, one of the earliest of its kind in the country, was constructed about the same time. The Garden has also long been known for its many fine specimens of rare trees. By the 1870s the main features of the Garden had been developed and, it was ready to play its part in the great expansion of botanical teaching and research that was about to take place at Cambridge. During the early years of the 20th century much of the pioneer work of William Bateson, Charles Chamberlain Hurst, and Edith Rebecca Saunders on plant genetics was carried out at the Garden, and it was later used for researches on plant physiology by Frederick Blackman and George Edward Briggs, and on plant pathology by Frederick Tom Brooks and others."]}, {"page": "Sexey's School", "response": ["*Frederick Tom Brooks FRS, botanist, Professor of Botany, Cambridge University, attended 1895\u20131898"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Frederick Tom Brooks||15/05/1930||17 December 1882 \u2013 11 March 1952"]}, {"page": "Frederick Brooks (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Frederick Tom Brooks (1882\u20131952), English botanist"]}, {"page": "F.T.Brooks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Tom Brooks"]}, {"page": "Frederick Thom Brooks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Tom Brooks"]}, {"page": "Frederick Thomas Brooks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Tom Brooks"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1930", "response": ["*Frederick Tom Brooks"]}, {"page": "F.

In 1949 Brooks asked Robertson to return to Cambridge to be a Lecturer in Mycology. At Cambridge, Robertson worked with John Rishbeth who was interested in the world of soil and Denis Garrett who was interested in cereal and tree root diseases. With a succession of outstanding students, Robertson did some of his best research. His initial studies were of the Hartig net in ectomycorrhiza associated with trees (Pinus sylvestris). In conjunction with Eric Buxton he later undertook pioneering work, unravelling of a deep understanding of the parasexual recombination and variation of Fusarium oxysporum."]}, {"page": "1947 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Frederick Tom Brooks, , Professor of Botany, Cambridge University."]}, {"page": "Wardomyces", "response": ["Wardomyces is a genus of seven species of mould fungi in the family Microascaceae. The genus was circumscribed in 1923 by Frederick Tom Brooks and Clifford Gerald Hansford. The generic name honours Harry Marshall Ward, Professor of Botany at Cambridge University. The type species, Wardomyces anomalus, was originally found as a mould growing on rabbit meat kept in cold storage. The most recent addition to the genus is W.\u00a0moseri, described by Walter Gams in 1995. Found in Colombia, it was discovered growing on a dead petiole of moriche palm (Mauritia flexuosa)."]}]}}
