He played his first match on 15 March 1939 in a 3\u20131 victory over Ireland and his last match on 21 May 1939 in a 2\u20131 defeat to France. His form attracted the attention of Liverpool and he joined the club on 28 June 1939 for a fee of around \u00a34,000. However, the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of World War II and he never played for the side."]}]}}
