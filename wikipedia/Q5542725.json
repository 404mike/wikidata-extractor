The entrance is at the east end and is formed by a semi-circular arch with stepped windows above that light the stairwell. There are similar windows on the east elevation. There is a high parapet on the fa\u00e7ade with the coat of arms of Professors George Murray Humphry and John Willis Clark.  Lettering and a motto on the fa\u00e7ade were cut by Eric Gill.

The first floor contained a barrel vaulted double height library and the Humphry Memorial Museum (in memory of the first Professor of Surgery, Sir George Murray Humphry).

Moore's interest in natural history was influenced by his acquaintances with Alfred Newton, Richard Owen, and Charles Darwin. The recipient of an eight-year residential scholarship at St Catharine's, Moore was invited by university's anatomy professor George Murray Humphry, to assist in the establishment of the school of science at Cambridge. Moore however ran foul of St Catharine's master, the Reverend Charles Kirkby Robinson, during a minor scuffle in hall. Robinson rusticated Moore, leading to Moore's friend Elwin waging a pamphlet war on his behalf. Though Moore was allowed to sit his exams, he lost his scholarship, and in 1869 he enrolled at St Bartholomew's, London, to study comparative anatomy."]}, {"page": "Frederick Akbar Mahomed", "response": ["In 1880 Mahomed made a first foray into public health. He wrote to the British Medical Journal to advocate undertaking the comprehensive systematic documentation of disease in Britain; he termed this idea, Collective Investigation. Mahomed\u2019s proposals were warmly supported by Sir George Murray Humphry, the President of the British Medical Association, and a Collective Investigation Committee was formed in 1881 with Mahomed as secretary.  Around this time Mahomed became acquainted with the British polymath, Francis Galton, who shared an interest in factors predisposing to disease. Mahomed and Galton collaborated to produce composite photographs  of over 400 patients with phthisis (Tuberculosis), which they compared with composite photographs based on 200 individuals without evidence of phthisis to test whether, as was widely believed, appearance or looks indicated a predisposition to disease. They found no evidence of a characteristic facial appearance associated with tuberculosis beyond some evidence of emaciation."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| George Murray Humphry||09/06/1859||18 July 1820 \u2013 24 September 1896 Surgeon, Cambridge University"]}, {"page": "Hunterian Oration", "response": ["*1879 Sir George Murray Humphry"]}, {"page": "Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge", "response": ["* George Murray Humphry (1820\u20131896), surgeon."]}, {"page": "William Gilson Humphry", "response": ["Humphry was born at Sudbury, Suffolk, on 30 January 1815, son of William Wood Humphry, barrister-at-law, and brother of George Murray Humphry.
