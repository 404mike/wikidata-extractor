In 1895, Pook was selected to represent Wales in the country's second game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, against Scotland. Under the captaincy of Wales rugby legend Arthur Gould, Pook was one of three Welsh players to make their d\u00e9but in the match. The other's being Pontypridd's Ernie George and Llanelli's Evan Lloyd. Wales initially threatened to pull out of the game, due to the team's belief that the Raeburn Place pitch was frozen, but agreed to compete when the playing field was shortneded by 20 yards to avoid a dangerous section of the field.Godwin (1984) pg 43.

The Welsh team contained five new caps, but the England team they faced fielded ten international debuts. Although vastly more inexperienced, the English team were victorious, and in the away game to Scotland Thomas was replaced by Evan Lloyd. Thomas' final game was his third home match, all of which had been played at different Welsh grounds, Rodney Parade, St. Helen's and now, against Ireland, the Cardiff Arms Park.
