He taught in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK. where he is Reader in Philosophy. He has been Honorary Treasurer of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science.\nHe was educated at Woodbridge School and Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1964 he began to study Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics. Soon afterwards he became one of Karl Popper's research assistants. In a series of papers in the 1970s, Miller and others uncovered defects in Popper's formal definition of verisimilitude, previously a mostly ignored aspect of Popper's theory. A substantial literature developed in the two decades following, including papers by Miller, to assess the remediability of Popper's approach.\nMiller's Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence is an attempt to expound, defend, and extend an approach to scientific knowledge identified with Popper. A central, \"not quite original\", thesis is that rationality does not depend on good reasons. Rather, it is better off without them, especially as they are unobtainable and unusable.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Falsifiability", "response": ["For Popper, induction is actually never needed in science. Instead, in Popper's view, laws are conjectured in a non-logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions. This has led David Miller, a student and collaborator of Popper, to write \"the mission is to classify truths, not to certify them\". In contrast, the logical empiricism movement, which included such philosophers as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath and A.J. Ayer wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that \"where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned\" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science."]}, {"page": "Friedrich Hayek", "response": [" The book in its published form may actually have been written entirely by its editor W.

The historian Lord Acton put the case for \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, places country above moral principles and creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism. Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.Motyl 1:298"]}, {"page": "Probability interpretations", "response": ["A number of other philosophers, including David Miller and Donald A.

Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.Thomas Bullemore, \"Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction\", Academia.edu"]}, {"page": "Critical rationalism", "response": ["Non-justificationism is also accepted by David Miller and Karl Popper.David Miller, \"Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defense, Open Court Publishing, 1994,  However, not all proponents of critical rationalism oppose justificationism; it is supported most prominently by John W. N. Watkins. In justificationism, criticism consists of trying to show that a claim cannot be reduced to the authority or criteria that it appeals to. That is, it regards the justification of a claim as primary, while the claim itself is secondary. By contrast, non-justificational criticism works towards attacking claims themselves.", "2.

Related to the point above, David Miller,In his Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence, Chapter 3 \"A Critique of Good Reasons\" attacks the use of \"good reasons\" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is ampliative and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more \"supported\" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* David Miller (philosopher)", "* David Miller (political theorist)"]}, {"page": "Pancritical rationalism", "response": ["* David Miller: Comprehensively Critical Rationalism: An Assessment.

Popper himself stated: \"I accepted the criticism of my definition within minutes of its presentation, wondering why I had not seen the mistake before.\" This result gave rise to a search for an account of verisimilitude that did not deem progress towards the truth an impossibility.", "Some of the new theories (e.g. those proposed by David Miller and by Theo Kuipers) build on Popper's approach, guided by the notion that truthlikeness is a function of a truth factor and a content factor. Others (e.g. those advanced by  in collaboration with , by Mortensen, and by Ken Gemes) are also inspired by Popper's approach but locate what they believe to be the error of Popper's proposal in his overly generous notion of content, or consequence, proposing instead that the consequences that contribute to closeness to truth must be, in a technical sense, \"relevant\". A different approach (already proposed by Tich\u00fd and  and developed especially by Ilkka Niiniluoto and Graham Oddie) takes the \"likeness\" in truthlikeness literally, holding that a proposition's likeness to the truth is a function of the overall likeness to the actual world of the possible worlds in which the proposition would be true. An attempt to use the notion of point-free metric space is proposed by Giangiacomo Gerla. There is currently a debate about whether or to what extent these different approaches to the concept are compatible."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* David Miller, philosopher"]}, {"page": "David Miller", "response": ["David Miller may refer to:", "* David Miller (engineer), aerospace engineer at MIT and NASA", "* David Miller (entomologist) (1890\u20131973), New Zealand entomologist, university lecturer and scientific administrator", "* David Miller (philosopher) (born 1942), British philosopher", "* David Miller (political theorist) (born 1946), professor at Oxford", "* David Miller (physician), pioneer in the home birth movement in Australia", "* David Miller (sociologist) (born 1964), British sociologist", "* David Miller (architect) (born 1944), Seattle architect", "* David Miller (director) (1909\u20131992), American film director", "* David Miller (American musician) (1883\u20131953), American country musician", "* David Miller (Australian musician) (born 1952), Australian pianist", "* David Miller (painter) (born c.1950), Australian artist", "* David Miller (tenor) (born 1973), operatic tenor and member of the band Il Divo", "* David Miller (editor), British writer and journalist", "* David Miller (poet) (born 1950), writer, poet, literary critic, and editor", "* David Miller (Canadian politician) (born 1958), former mayor of Toronto and later president of WWF-Canada", "* David Miller (Iowa politician) (born 1946), American politician", "* David Miller (public servant) (1857\u20131934), senior Australian public servant", "* David Miller (Wyoming politician) (born 1953), American politician", "* David Miller (baseball) (born 1973), American college baseball coach", "* David Miller (Australian cricketer) (1870\u20131943), Australian cricketer", "* David Miller (English cricketer) (born 1974), former English cricketer", "* David Miller (South African cricketer) (born 1989), South African cricketer", "* David Miller (American football) (born 1984), defensive end", "* David Miller (Australian footballer) (born 1957), VFL footballer for Richmond", "* David Miller (darts player), American professional darts player", "* David Miller (harness racing) (born 1964), American harness racing driver and trainer", "* David Miller (ice hockey) (1924\u20131996), Canadian ice hockey player", "* David Miller (judoka) (born 1961), Canadian judoka", "* David Miller (sailor) (born 1943), Canadian sailor", "* David Miller (gangster), also known as Davy \"Yiddles\" Miller, a member of the Chicago gang Ragen's Colts", "* David Miller (moderator), Scottish minister"]}, {"page": "David Miller (Philosopher)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Miller (philosopher) "]}, {"page": "Global justice", "response": ["Per the American political scientist Iris Marion Young \"A widely accepted philosophical view continues to hold that the scope of obligations of justice is defined by membership in a common political community.

Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995. We may have humanitarian duties to aid the particularly badly off worldwide, but these are much less stringent and pressing than our duties to our fellow-citizens.  Nationalism has traditionally included this assumption of differing moral obligations to those within and those outside the nation, reflected for example in the fact that the benefits of the welfare state are not available to citizens of other countries. So, moral universalism is too simple, because the ethical standards that apply between compatriots differ from those that apply between strangers (although some nationalists argue for the universal ethical standard that nations should have their own states).  Distributive justice is an issue within nations but not necessarily between them.
