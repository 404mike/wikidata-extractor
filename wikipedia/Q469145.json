In Chain of Command, Predaking finds a Predacon fossil that enables him to regain some of his memories when he has a vision of another Predacon. At the end of Plus One, it is shown that his intelligence is evolving; demonstrating it by accessing the Decepticon communication network to learn more about his Predacon brethren on Earth. In Evolution, Predaking demonstrates his ability to transform and gains the power of speech. This causes Megatron to fear Predaking betraying and leading the newly created Predacon army against him, so he tricks the Autobots into destroying the Predacon cloning laboratory. In Synthesis, Predaking finds out the truth and tries to kill Megatron, but is thrown out of the ship. In Deadlock, Predaking is seen clinging to the Nemesis, but retreats to live on Cybertron when the planet is restored.
