He played for Essex between 1904 and 1910. His son, Hopper Read, also played for Essex and made one Test appearance for England, in 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hopper Read", "response": ["Originally from Winchester College, Read never went up to either Oxford or Cambridge University but his reputation as a fast bowler in club cricket was such that Surrey gave him a trial against those two Universities in 1933 even though he never claimed qualification to represent Surrey in County Championship matches. Although he took 4 for 26 in the second innings against Cambridge, Surrey did not think it worth having Read properly qualify for them and they raised no objections when Essex asked if he might be available. Read was obviously qualified for Essex: not only was he born there but his father, Arnold Read, had played 22 games for their first eleven between 1904 and 1910."]}, {"page": "Ralph Kimbell", "response": ["Kimbell played his only first-class match for Northamptonshire in the 1908 County Championship against Essex.  In this match, he was dismissed for a duck by Johnny Douglas in Northamptonshire's first-innings.  In their second-innings he was dismissed for 4 runs by Bill Reeves.  With the ball, he took 2 wickets, those of Arnold Read and Walter Mead in the Essex first-innings."]}, {"page": "Arnold Reid", "response": ["#REDIRECTArnold Read"]}]}}
