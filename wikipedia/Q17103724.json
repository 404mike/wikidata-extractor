Their attendance at the Bangor seminar, together with Harrison and Lennon's promotional activities, resulted in Transcendental Meditation becoming a worldwide phenomenon. In his book American Veda, author Philip Goldberg likens the Maharishi's Hilton lecture to Swami Vivekananda's visit to the West in 1893, in terms of its importance for Indian religion. As a result of the coverage given to the Beatles' interest, words such as \"mantra\" and \"guru\" became commonly used in the West for the first time. While the band's new, anti-LSD message was met with approval, their championing of the Maharishi and his TM technique was often the subject of confusion and ridicule in the mainstream press, particularly in Britain. At a court event in October, Queen Elizabeth II remarked to Sir Joseph Lockwood, the chairman of EMI: \"The Beatles are turning awfully funny, aren't they?\" Now publicised as \"The Beatles' Guru\", the Maharishi went on his eighth world tour, giving lectures in Britain, Scandinavia, West Germany, Italy, Canada and California."]}, {"page": "Lockwood, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Lockwood"]}]}}
