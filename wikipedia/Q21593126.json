He was described by James Campbell as \"one of the most distinguished and provocative of Anglo-Saxonists\". D. H. Farmer described his studies of the English Benedictine Reform, mainly in pages 154-264 of Orbis Britanniae, as \"both stimulating and provocative; even those who cannot assent to all his conclusions recognise that he has brought a new dimension to the study of the reform\".His books included:\n\nThe king and the monks in the tenth-century Reformation.

In Abels' view \u00c6thelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an \"avid attention\" in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that \"\u00c6thelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings\", and the mid-20th-century historian Eric John observes that \"a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as when he was on his knees\". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred P. Smyth, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that \u00c6thelwulf freed a tenth part of land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it \"is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a partial remission of royal dues\". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid", "response": ["Wilfrid delayed his return from Gaul, only to find on his arrival back in Northumbria that Ceadda had been installed as bishop in his place. The reason for Wilfrid's delay has never been clear, although the historians Eric John and Richard Abels theorise that it was caused by Alhfrith's unsuccessful revolt against Oswiu. They suggest that the rebellion happened shortly after Whitby, perhaps while Wilfrid was in Gaul for his consecration. Because Oswiu knew that Alhfrith had been a supporter of Wilfrid's, Oswiu prevented Wilfrid's return, suspecting Wilfrid of supporting his rivals.Abels \"Council of Whitby\" Journal of British Studies pp. 18\u201319 That Ceadda was supported by Oswiu, and Wilfrid had been a supporter of Oswiu's son, lends further credence to the theory that Alhfrith's rebellion took place while Wilfrid was in Gaul.Farmer \"Introduction\" Age of Bede p. 23 Stephen of Ripon reported that Wilfrid was expelled by \"Quartodecimans\", or those who supported the celebration of Easter on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan, whether or not this was a Sunday. However, as the Irish church had never been Quartodecimans, Stephen in this instance was constructing a narrative to put Wilfrid in the best light.Rollason \"Hagiography and Politics\" Holy Men and Holy Women p. 100", "In 677Stenton Anglo Saxon England p. 136 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was expelled from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of \u00c6thelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. \u00c6thelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues that they had been part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover.Higham Kingdom of Northumbria pp. 135\u2013136 The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.", "One commentator has said that Wilfrid \"came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age\".Quoted in Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 62 Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that \"Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility\". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that \"Wilfrid's character was such that he seems to have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure\". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop.Brown Rise of Western Christendom Second Edition pp. 363\u2013364 The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England pp. 35\u201337"]}, {"page": "Stigand", "response": ["Although monastic chroniclers after the Norman Conquest accused him of crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any evidence of those crimes.Smith \"Archbishop Stigand\" Anglo-Norman Studies 16 p. 217Stafford Queen Emma and Queen Edith p. 151 Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king.Rumble \"From Winchester to Canterbury\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 180 Modern historians views tend to see him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his \"whole career shows that he was essentially a politician\".Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 466 Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that \"Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power.\"Higham Death of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 219\u2013220 Another historian, Eric John, said that \"Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom\".John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England p. 174 However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that \"he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held\". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was \"unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms\".Rumble \"From Winchester to Canterbury\"  Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 179"]}, {"page": "Herbert McCabe", "response": ["Herbert McCabe was born in Middlesbrough in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under \u00c6thelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards.Mayr-Harting \"Augustine\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England pp. 28\u201330"]}, {"page": "Seinfeld: A XXX Parody", "response": ["Seinfeld: A XXX Parody is a 2009 pornographic film that parodies the series Seinfeld which ran from 1989 until 1998.
