Their financing enabled Artscribe to become a colour glossy. Collings continued his policy of internationalism, bringing in articles and reviews from the United States and continental Europe to mix with coverage of British art. He also set up a group of contributing editors based abroad, and persuaded high-profile artists to make unique cover-images and 'artist's pages' for the magazine.  These included glamorous figures of the moment such as George Condo, Julian Schnabel, Markus L\u00fcpertz, Albert Oehlen, , Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Fischl and Nancy Spero, but also worthy Brits, such as Art & Language, Hannah Collins, Ian McKeever and Gerard Hemsworth. In 1987 Collings received a commendation for his transformation of Artscribe from the Turner Prize jury (other art-world figures singled out for commendation that year were Nicholas Serota, soon to be director of the Tate). Collings was fired as editor by the owners later that year after an argument with one of the office staff. (He went on to write and present popular TV programmes on art and now combines TV work with painting.)"]}, {"page": "Bill Meyer (artist)", "response": ["Meyer established a fine art editioning studio in London during the 1970s at 10 Martello Street, Hackney. By 1973 he was collaborating with Avital Geva, Moshe Gershuni, Matthew Greenberg and Michael Druks exhibiting at the Romi Goldmuntz Centre, Antwerp. He printed for many artists including Ian McKeever and Genesis P'Orridge with Cosey Fanni Tutti making posters for the infamous Prostitution show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1976, as well as conceiving and creating photo-events with Genesis and Cosey as performers and models. He has since continued to use photography, film and music in his work. He has worked with a large number of Australian artists at Port Jackson Press publishing in Melbourne. During the eighties, while he was a committee member, and later when he was president of the Print Council of Australia, Meyer curated travelling exhibitions including the controversial Print as Object. He also created Gapscape, an exhibition of his prints and drawings which toured twenty-four regional Australian galleries. In 1995 he participated in The Wandering Jew. Myth and Metaphor, curated and toured for the Jewish Museum of Australia, an organisation with which he has collaborated in numerous other curated and solo projects. Recent work includes the 105 metre charcoal on paper installation, A Special Place - HaMakom, and experiments with Lamda photographic digital prints."]}, {"page": "McKeever", "response": ["*Ian McKeever (artist) (born 1946), British artist", "*Ian McKeever (mountaineer) (1970-2013), Irish mountaineer"]}, {"page": "Foksal Gallery", "response": ["*Ian McKeever"]}, {"page": "Pori Art Museum", "response": ["The collections have works by many notable international artists, including names like Jos\u00e9 Bedia Vald\u00e9s, Ian McKeever, Leonhard Lapin, Yan Pei Ming, Georges Rousse, Yoko Ono and Dennis Oppenheim."]}, {"page": "Ian McKeever", "response": ["Ian McKeever may refer to:", "*Ian McKeever (artist)  (born 1946), British artist", "*Ian McKeever (mountaineer)  (1970\u20132013), Irish mountaineer"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Ian McKeever   ||align=\"center\" |  2003  || "]}, {"page": "The Minories, Colchester", "response": ["The acquisition and subsequent sale of Robert Bevan\u2019s The Cab Yard in the 1970s paved the way for the purchase of the adjacent property as a new exhibiting space, which became known as The Girling Room.
