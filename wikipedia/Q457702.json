Although the series performed well in the ratings, a second series was not commissioned. In between the pilot and the series of The Old Campaigner, in April 1968, Terry-Thomas appeared on the British ITV network in a one-off variety special, The Big Show, which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues. Robert Ross commented that Terry-Thomas \"seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in movies\u00a0... the top raconteur was back where he belonged\". In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director Ken Annakin for a joint Italian, French and British production Monte Carlo or Bust!. The film was \"the only copper-bottomed sequel to\u00a0... Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\", according to Richard Ross. Terry-Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the \"thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware-Armitage\", his role in Those Magnificent Men. Terry-Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year, including Arthur? Arthur! (which he joked had \"never been shown anywhere\u2014as far as I know!\"), as well as on television in the UK, US and Australia.", "He continued to work as much as possible, although\u2014as the film historian Geoff Mayer pointed out\u2014the situation \"reduced his film career to supporting roles and cameos\". The lucrative voice-over role of Sir Hiss in the 1973 Walt Disney film Robin Hood was one notable part, while others were less well-known, such as The Vault of Horror, a film described by Richard Ross as a \"cornball terror\", in which he starred with Curd J\u00fcrgens, Tom Baker and Denholm Elliott. He also continued to appear on television shows in the US and UK; and in advertisements, including appearing with June Whitfield for Birds Eye fish fingers, a series of vermouth advertisements filmed in Italy, and an award-winning series for Benson & Hedges with Eric Sykes.", "Terry-Thomas's screen characters were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that \"although there would be variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life\". Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, said it was \"always the same character and always funny\". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him \"the definitive postwar cad or rotter\". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that \"T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain\u00a0... bounder\u00a0... aristocratic rogue\u00a0... upper-class English twit\u00a0... genuine English eccentric\u00a0... one of the last real gentlemen\u00a0... wet, genteel Englishman\u00a0... high-bred idiot\u00a0... cheeky blighter\u00a0... camel-haired cad\u00a0... amiable buffoon\u00a0... pompous Englishman\u00a0... twentieth-century dandy\u00a0... stinker\u00a0... king of the cads\u00a0... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas\"."]}, {"page": "Great Smog of London", "response": ["An episode of The Goon Show entitled 'Forog', broadcast on the BBC Home Service 21 December 1954 was a thinly veiled satire on the killer fog crisis.
