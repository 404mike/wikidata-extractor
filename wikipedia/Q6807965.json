Ezra Pound's 'Envoi' to his longer poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) begins \"Go, dumb-born book\", and thus explicitly gives the 'Envoi' title to the long-standing genre of writing a farewell poem addressed to the book of poems itself, previously used for example by Edmund Spenser in The Shepheardes Calender (1579) or Anne Bradstreet in 'The Author to Her Book' (1650s). Later writers such as William Meredith and Meg Bateman have also written envois of this kind.
