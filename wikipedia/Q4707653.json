From 1934 he served the Anglican Church in Mauritius, firstly as a missionary priest then as Archdeacon of Mauritius. Returning to England he became Vicar of Twickenham followed by a spell as Rural Dean of Hampstead before appointment to the episcopate as Bishop of Mauritius in 1959. Translated to become Bishop of Fulham (a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of London with delegated responsibility from the Bishop of London for northern and central Europe) in 1966, his final appointment was a sideways move to become Bishop of Edmonton (another suffragan bishop of that Diocese, but actually ministering there) four years later. That See was erected on 29 May 1970 in order to supervise a new district of the diocese created by the experimental area scheme that year.In retirement he continued to serve the church as an honorary assistant bishop (in the Diocese of Peterborough and then the Kensington area of the London diocese) for a further quarter of a century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bishop of Fulham", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 1966 ||align=\"center\"| 1970 || Alan Rogers ||"]}, {"page": "Bishop of London", "response": ["*1985\u20131991 (res.), in Kensington area: Alan Rogers, retired Bishop of Edmonton"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Peterborough", "response": ["*1975\u20131984 (res.): Alan Rogers, retired Bishop of Fulham and of Edmonton"]}, {"page": "St. Andrew's School (Mauritius)", "response": ["St. Andrew's School is a private, Anglican secondary school in Rose-Hill, Mauritius.
