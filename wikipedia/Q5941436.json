All of these were in England,\nwith the majority for Worcestershire and Oxford University.\nVery much a specialist bowler, his Wisden obituary commented that \"His qualities as a batsman [could] be gauged from the fact that in his five innings against Cambridge he scored one run.\"\nHe was nicknamed Barmy Gilbert.Gilbert was born in Malabar Hill, Bombay (now Mumbai), but was educated in England, at Charterhouse, before going on to Christ Church, Oxford.He made his first-class debut for Oxford against Lancashire at the Christ Church ground in May 1907, taking the single wicket of Harry Dean.\nA little later in the summer, he took what was to remain a career-best innings haul of 8\u201348 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at The University Parks.\nGilbert maintained his place in the Oxford side throughout that and the following two seasons, winning his Blue in each year and topping Oxford's bowling averages in 1908 and 1909.\nHe twice took six wickets in an innings in the University Match against Cambridge at Lord's: in 1907 he took 6\u201336, while two years later he claimed 6\u201352.While still at Oxford, he also made the first of his four appearances in the Gentlemen v Players match, and in this game \u2013 at The Oval in July 1908 \u2013 he took 3\u201343 and 6\u2013112 to help the Gentlemen to a six-wicket victory.\nAlso, in May 1909, he claimed innings figures of 8\u201371 for his university against the touring Australians,\nand as a result was put on standby for the first Test at Edgbaston, although he was not in the end called upon to play.After coming down from Oxford at the end of 1909, Gilbert concentrated on his career as a barrister\nand played only a handful of matches each season up until the First World War. These games came for the likes of MCC, Free Foresters and Gentlemen of England, though he also made a single (and unsuccessful) appearance for Minor Counties against the South Africans in 1912. On the resumption of first-class cricket in 1919, Gilbert played a few more games for such teams, but he made no appearances at all the following season.In 1921, Gilbert made his county cricket debut with Worcestershire, and played a considerable number of games for the county in that and the following summer. Apart from one game for MCC against Oxford in 1921, and one for Free Foresters against Cambridge in 1922, all his matches during this period were for Worcestershire.\nHe enjoyed considerable success, taking 84 first-class wickets at 24.54 and 85 first-class wickets at 28.55 in the respective years,\nwith a best bowling performance of 7\u201360 for Worcestershire against Nottinghamshire at Worcester in August 1921.\nGilbert captained the county against Derbyshire at the same venue a year later.He played a few further games for Worcestershire in 1923 and turned out just once in 1924, after which he was entirely absent from first-class cricket for four years.\nHe returned in 1928, continuing with Worcestershire, and played a large proportion of the 1929 season, but he was not a particular success and only twice took more than three wickets in an innings.\nHe made one last first-class appearance in the spring of 1930, when he endured a grim farewell against the Australians: Worcestershire were crushed by an innings and 165 runs as Bradman hit 236 \u2013 his first century in England \u2013 while Gilbert bowled only four overs, which disappeared for 30. With the bat he was bowled for nought in his first innings and was absent hurt in the second.Gilbert died in Bishopstone, Herefordshire at the age of 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Humphrey Gilbert (1886\u20131960), Indian-born English cricketer who played in 118 first-class matchesObituary.
