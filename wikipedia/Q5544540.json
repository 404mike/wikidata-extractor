He played football for the Unity Gas Depot works team before joining Small Heath in 1887. In Small Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, Short scored four goals in 13 appearances playing as a winger, but later he became most comfortable at full back. This meant a lengthy spell in the reserve team, because first-choice defenders Tom Bayley and Fred Speller missed only two games between them in the next two seasons. Short returned to the first team for the club's first season in the Football League in 1892\u201393, contributing to their winning the inaugural Second Division championship. He helped the club to runners-up spot in the Second Division the following season, which this time brought promotion to the First Division via the test match system, but never played in the top flight. He joined Oldbury Town of the Birmingham & District League in 1895.Short's younger brother Charlie also played professionally for Small Heath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892\u201393 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["All the regular first-team members during the previous season \u2013 goalkeepers Chris Charsley and George Hollis, backs Tom Bayley and Fred Speller, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Harry Morris, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon \u2013 remained with the club. Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 124, 141. and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon after the start of the season, also from Singer's. They played in the same kit as in the previous season: royal blue shirts and stockings with white knickerbockers.", "Small Heath forced several early corners, but then conceded on the break when Alf Farman scored from a Tommy Fitzsimmons pass. Towards half-time, they had chances from a scramble in front of the Newton Heath goal, and pressed hard after the interval, the persistence of Wheldon eventually securing an equaliser \"after brilliant work by all of the Small Heath forwards\". \"Capital defensive play\" by both teams prevailed thereafter, and the match was drawn. The Manchester Guardian noted the contrast in attacking style, as \"the Small Heath players were playing a most scientific game, but the rushes of Newton Heath were often very dangerous\", and the Gazette's reporter felt that half-backs George Short and, particularly, Jenkyns had been \"inclined to take matters a little too easily\" in the first half."]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71.

Charles Partridge, making his Football League debut after Hollis was taken ill, played behind an experimental defensive pairing of half-back Ted Devey and reserve-team player George Short. Despite the scoreline, the Nottinghamshire Guardian described them as \"a very useful pair of backs\", although not up to the home team's standard, and the Daily Post rated Devey as \"easily the best left-back the club have played this season\". Two of Notts' goals were fortunate: an attempted clearance by Devey ricocheted off Jenkyns' head for their second goal, and for their third, the ball appeared to be heading safely over the crossbar until caught by a gust of wind.", "Handicapped early on by George Short suffering concussion and being unable to continue, Small Heath lost the replayed Charity Cup semi-final to Wolverhampton Wanderers 2\u20130. Fred Wheldon was the only Second Division player selected in the Football League representative team to play the Scottish League at Goodison Park, Liverpool.

In more recent times, John Gayle scored the winning goal as Birmingham beat Tranmere Rovers in the 1991 Football League Trophy Final. The 18-year-old Darren Carter converted the decisive penalty in the 2002 play-off final shootout by which Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time; goalkeeper Nico Vaesen saved one of the opponents' spot-kicks. The Birmingham team that won the 2011 League Cup featured five men listed here, including Ben Foster, who won the man of the match award.
