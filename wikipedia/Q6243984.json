During the Second World War, he served as a pilot, first in the Battle of Britain and later with the Fleet Air Arm.\nDuring his political career, his positions included serving on the Parliamentary Science Committee, the Estimates Committee, the Expenditure Committee and the Select Committee on Defence. During Churchill's later years, he was entrusted by the Tory Whips to look after the grand old man himself. He was knighted in 1962.\nHe was married four times, firstly to Elisabeth Neustadtl in 1943.  The couple were divorced in 1951, and she married Major Robert Rivers-Bulkeley. In 1953, he married Flora Innes Stuart, daughter of Ian St Clair Stuart, but the marriage was dissolved in 1969, after which he married Maxine Veale in 1971.
