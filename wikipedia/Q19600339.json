He has written for the British newspapers The Guardian and The Times and is the Features Editor for the industry magazine Building Design. He trained and worked as an architect before becoming a journalistOliver Wainwright studied architecture at the University of Cambridge, graduating with a double first, before the Royal College of Art.As well as being a writer and journalist, Wainwright has collaborated on design projects with the Architecture Foundation and the National Building Museum, and has lectured at several British architecture schools. He is the son of former Guardian journalist Martin Wainwright.\nWainwright has praised the work of architect firm Stanton Williams and defended the company's design of the Sainsbury Laboratory after it won the 2012 RIBA Stirling Prize, despite its superficially prefabricated style. He has criticised the design of the Liverpool Museum, highlighting problems of being over budget and in his opinion too close to the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, at the time a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He described the restaurant in the Walkie Talkie tower at 20 Fenchurch Street as \"like being in an airport terminal\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Poundbury", "response": ["Nonetheless, the project has also received praise.

A review in Germany's Der Tagesspiegel noted that the book coincided with the international controversy over Istanbul's Hagia Sophia, a former church and museum that had been reconverted into a mosque. Contrary to Wainwright's headline, Darke instead argues that culture is interconnected and architecture does not belong to a single culture. In the book, she mentions how the Muslims themselves adapted some elements from the Greek and Roman remains in the Middle East.
