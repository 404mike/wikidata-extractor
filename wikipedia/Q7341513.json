One example is \"The Miser's Man (dating from between 1863-85). At the start of the 19th century, the theme had figured as an episode in Robert Anderson's \"Croglin Watty\". A simple-minded countryman down from the fells, Watty was hired by the real-life Carlisle miser Margery Jackson (1722\u20131812) and served her for a quarter.

Known as 'the Cumbrian Minstrel', he too wrote in Scots and these poems appeared in the new editions of his poems published from Wigton in 1807 and 1808. What seems to have lifted use of Cumbrian dialect from a passing curiosity to a demonstration of regional pride in the hands of labouring class poets was the vogue of Robert Burns, among whose disciples the calico worker Robert Anderson counted himself. His Ballads in the Cumberland Dialect were published from Carlisle in 1805 and were reprinted in several different formats over the following decades. Some of these publications also incorporated the work of his precursors and a few other contemporaries, such as Ewan Clark and Mark Lonsdale. One such collection was Ballads in the Cumberland dialect, chiefly by R. Anderson (1808, second edition 1815, Wigton),Google Books and a third from Carlisle in 1823."]}, {"page": "1833 in poetry", "response": ["* September 26 \u2013 Robert Anderson (born 1770), English Cumbrian dialect poet"]}, {"page": "1805 in poetry", "response": ["* Robert Anderson, Ballads in the Cumberland DialectCox, Michael, editor, The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2004, "]}, {"page": "1770 in poetry", "response": ["* February 1 \u2013 Robert Anderson (died 1833), English Cumbrian dialect poet"]}, {"page": "Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings", "response": ["|167||Impatient Lassie \u2013 (The)||Robert Anderson \u2013 probably||Low down in the broom||||||", "|167||a mention of||Robert Anderson||||Cumberland Ballads||\u00b3||", "|167||Short bio||Robert Anderson||||||||"]}, {"page": "List of Geordie songwriters", "response": ["|Robert Anderson"]}, {"page": "Joseph Cooper Walker", "response": ["Walker's Memoirs of Alessandro Tassoni were published posthumously in 1815, with a preface by his brother, Samuel Walker.
