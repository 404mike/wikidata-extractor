His research comprises many themes in computational and applied mathematics: ordinary and partial differential equations, approximation theory, geometric numerical integration, orthogonal polynomials, functional equations, computational dynamics and the computation of highly oscillatory phenomena.\nHe has written a textbook, A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed. 2009).Arieh Iserles is the Managing Editor of Acta Numerica, Editor-in-Chief of IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis and an editor of several other mathematical journals. From 1997 to 2000 he was the chair of the Society for the Foundations of Computational Mathematics.From 2010 to 2015 he was a Director of the Cambridge Centre for Analysis (CCA), an EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in mathematical analysis.\nIn 1999, he was awarded the Onsager Medal, by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in 2012 he received the David Crighton medal, presented by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications and London Mathematical Society \"for services to mathematics and the mathematics community\"  and in 2014 he was awarded by Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics the SIAM Prize for Distinguished Service to the Profession.

That meeting hosted a number of sub-conferences on the frontier of Mathematics and Computation, focusing on many topics from numerical analysis and on the importance of a foundational theory of real number computation. The main thrust was on creating a shared intellectual space for activity bringing together computation and mathematics. During the final week at Michael Shub's behest an informal lunch was arranged where Felipe Cucker, Arieh Iserles, Narendra Karmarkar, James Renegar, Michael Shub and Stephen Smale decided to go ahead and create a permanent entity that would organize periodic conferences covering subjects in the interplay between these two areas.
