Art Nouveau released a track called \"The Fear Machine\", which sold a few hundred copies and enjoyed airtime on John Peel's show. In spite of the song's success, the band failed to secure a record deal during this period.", "As success came, tensions began to rise in the band. These tensions culminated in Limahl being fired by the other band members in mid-1983 and Nick Beggs then taking over as lead singer. In response to his ousting, Limahl accused the others of being envious of him and said \"I've been betrayed!\" and \"I was sacked for making them a success.\" The other band members countered Limahl's assertions, insisting that he had become egomaniacal and increasingly difficult to work with. Soon after the departure, Beggs commented, \"It was a business decision and not one we took lightly. He wanted the band to go in a different direction to the rest of us. Eventually, we realised we were on a different planet to Limahl.\" Beggs also stated that the band harboured no ill-will towards Limahl, and blamed the press for sensationalising the matter. Guitarist Steve Askew commented \"At first ... we did everything possible to make Limahl feel like part of the furniture but, you know, his lifestyle is so different from ours. We're very normal people whereas Limahl likes the bright lights.\"", "In 2007, Nick Beggs, Steve Askew, and Stuart Neale decided to continue as Kajagoogoo, releasing the single \"Rocket Boy\" on 24 June 2007. The single received airplay on Steve Wright's BBC Radio 2 show in the UK, and a new album, Gone to the Moon, was scheduled for release on the Spectra Records label later on that year. However, the album was postponed, and in February 2008, the three Kajagoogoo members announced plans to reunite with original members singer Limahl and drummer Jez Strode. This was due in part to Bradley Snelling, the organiser of the Retrofest event and the band's new manager. Snelling had succeeded in reuniting the band, arranging their first photo shoot together in 25 years.", "* Steve Askew \u2013 guitars, programming, backing vocals (1978\u20131985, 2003\u20132004, 2007\u20132011)"]}, {"page": "Limahl", "response": ["Limahl later said: \"I was in utter disbelief but the overwhelming emotion was anger, mainly towards the manager at first, but later, as I mulled over the 'betrayal', I was especially angry at my four professional colleagues, who I had viewed not only as friends but almost as family.\" The band stated Limahl had become difficult to work with as they didn't share his vision for the band's future.
