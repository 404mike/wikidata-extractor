In 1971, Roy Palmer recorded George Dunn of Quarry Bank, Staffordshire singing a version close to the famous one, which had a familiar version of the chorus, but used the song \"Christmas is Coming\" as the verses; this recording can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. Amy Ford of Low Ham, Somerset sang a version called \"The Singers Make Bold\" to Bob and Jacqueline Patten in 1973 which again used a similar chorus to the famous version and can be heard via the British Library Sound Archive.

Also, poaching was carried out in rural settings rather than the urban environment inhabited by apprentices gone to the bad. Roy Palmer argues that this song was written to chronicle the first cases, soon after 1828, when \"it was enacted that if three or more men were found in a wood after dark and one of them carried a gun or a bludgeon, all were liable for transportation for fourteen years\".Palmer, Roy, (ed); English Country Songbook; London; 1979"]}, {"page": "Roy Palmer", "response": ["Roy Palmer may refer to:", "* Roy Palmer (musician) (1892\u20131963), American jazz trombonist", "* Roy Palmer (cricketer) (born 1942), English cricketer and umpire", "* Roy Palmer (folklorist) (1932\u20132015), singer, teacher, folklorist, author and historian"]}, {"page": "Walter Pardon", "response": ["Many folk song collectors interviewed and recorded him, including Bill Leader, Mike Yates, Rod Stradling, and Roy Palmer.", "There are a number of field recordings of Walter Pardon singing songs and ballads, and playing, as well as interviews and other material available online at the British Library Sound Archive in the Reg Hall and Roy Palmer collections.

The text of one song, The Long Whip, seems to have been lost completely as a result. Vaughan Williams knew that the texts of many of the songs he was preserving had been printed as broadsides and he sometimes used broadside texts to fill out his songs for publication. He did not bowdlerise the material he collected for publication, as some other collectors did, but was as much as they were forced to recognise the constraints of the time when it came to publishing \"unsuitable\" material. Sometimes too he failed to note singers' names or occupations."]}]}}
