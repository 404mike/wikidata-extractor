According to Adolf Zukor, Edwin S. Porter reached a new high with his camera work. One long scene showed Thomas Holding as David Rossi, pleading with Fuller Mellish as the pope during a walk in the Vatican gardens. Unfortunately Holding clutched Mellish\u2019s arm. After the company returned they learned that no one was allowed to touch the pope in such a manner. It was possible that Catholics might take offence. Hall Caine had been an adversary of the Catholic Church which complicated the matter further. The film was in trouble. A ban by the Catholic church risked putting Famous Players out of business. As much as possible of the offending scene was cut but some had to stay. There only other option was to postpone the release and send the company back to Rome. By this time, extensive distribution plans had been made. Zukor called on Bishop, later Cardinal Hayes and explained their innocent mistake. Hayes was sympathetic, and the film was released. Afterwards Zukor and Hayes became good friends, often discussing the moral and religious implications of the film."]}, {"page": "The Lady of Red Butte", "response": ["The Lady of Red Butte is a 1919 American silent Western film written by C.

The village was two blocks long with buildings on both sides of the street. It was built at Inceville on a high elevation far from all other buildings so the flames would not spread to other property. The Santa Monica Fire Department and one chemical wagon from Los Angeles Fire Department were on hand to prevent the flames spreading to the shrubbery and timber on the mountains. When Thomas H. Ince gave the word, the fire was ignited, and the flames were \"fanned into a fury by three huge wind machines.\" Between the walls of roaring flames, Dorothy Dalton, Thomas Holding and the two hundred players acted several dramatic scenes, as seven cameras shot the action under the direction of Victor L.

The scene of the story is London with a panorama of coloring, ranging from the magnificence of Buckingham Palace to the mysterious depths of the shadowy Limehouse district. The author personally arranged the scenario for Mr. Read, the producer. Much of the action takes place in Soho, the French quarter of London, where Sonia (Louise Glaum) who knows nothing of her parentage or past, is the attraction for the curious slumming parties. The plot centers about Sonia's captivity in the house of a celebrated crook, her discovery of mysterious maneuverings to poison all London, and the intense climax which follows directly after her recognition of her father, \"The Lone Wolf\", who has been working, unknown to her or by her, in the same household.
