In late 19th-century France, the insinuation that the French government was in the power of the Jews was a commonplace claim in nationalist discourse."]}, {"page": "Francis Parker Yockey", "response": ["Without notes, Yockey wrote his first book, Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics, in Brittas Bay, Ireland over the winter and early spring of 1948. It is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century materialism and rationalism. It is dedicated to 'The hero of the twentieth century, he intended that description to apply to Adolf Hitler.Theodore J. O'Keefe of the Journal of Historical Review makes this assertion in his review of Kevin Coggan's 1999 study of Yockey. According to the late Doris Foster Lessard, an historian for many years in Ludington, Michigan, this information about Imperium was apparently known to Ludington residents of Yockey's parents' social circle. In a rebuttal to the accusations of Arnold Leese, Yockey stated that the \"hero\" of which he spoke was indeed Hitler. The views expressed in Imperium were endorsed by far-Right thinkers around the world including former German General Otto Remer; Professor of Classics at the University of Illinois, Revilo P. Oliver; and Italian esotericist Julius Evola.Coogan 1999 Yockey became embittered with Sir Oswald Mosley after the latter refused to publish or review Imperium upon its completion, after having promised to do so. Guy Chesham, one of the leaders of Mosley's movement, actually resigned from it, in part because of Mosley's treatment of Yockey. Imperium subscribes to Spengler's suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the 'Roman' role in Western Civilization by uniting all its constituent states into one large empire."]}, {"page": "John Tyndall (far-right activist)", "response": ["By 2000, Tyndall was beginning to agitate against Griffin's leadership, criticising the establishment of the party's Ethnic Liaison Committee \u2014 which had one half-Turkish member (Lawrence Rustem) \u2014 as a move towards admitting non-whites into the party. He was also critical of Griffin's abandonment of the party's compulsory removal of migrants and non-whites from the country, believing that if they stayed in a segregated system then Britain would resemble apartheid-era South Africa, which he did not think was preferable. His main criticisms were focused not on the party's changing direction, but on Griffin's character itself, portraying him as unscrupulous and self-centred. Tyndall was determined to retake control of the party, and in this was supported by a group of party hardliners. During a proposed leadership challenge, Tyndall put forward his name, although withdrew it following the 2001 general election when Griffin led the BNP to a clear growth in electoral support. Tyndall nevertheless believed that the BNP's electoral success had less to do with Griffin's reforms and more to do with external factors such as the 2001 Oldham riots. In turn, Griffin criticised Tyndall in the pages of Identity, claiming that the latter was committed to \"the sub-Mosleyite wackiness of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League and the Big Government mania of the 1930s\". Griffin expelled Tyndall from the party in August 2003, but had to allow his return following an out-of-court settlement shortly after.", "The political scientist Nigel Copsey believed that Chesterton had been the \"seminal influence\" on Tyndall's thought. Thurlow disagreed, arguing that Tyndall had been influenced less by Chesterton and Mosley and more by a third figure in Britain's \"fascist tradition\", Arnold Leese. Thurlow noted that Tyndall adopted Leese's \"political intransigence\u00a0... his refusal to compromise with political reality and his willingness to martyr himself for his beliefs\". According to Trilling, the \"two guiding stars in\u00a0... Tyndall's political universe\" were Hitler and the British Empire. In contrast to many of his contemporaries in the British far-right, Tyndall was \"thoroughly indifferent\" to the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite, a French extreme-right movement which had emerged in the 1960s. Whereas the Nouvelle Droite sought to move away from the approach adopted by the fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s, Tyndall remained wedded to white racial nationalism, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and nostalgia for the British Empire, all approaches generally repudiated by the Nouvelle Droite."]}, {"page": "Dromedary", "response": ["The dromedary shares the genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) and the wild Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) was the first to describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type\u00a0\u2013 slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.

Jordan had wanted a ban on Jews and non-white members enshrined in the League but this had been rejected by League chief A. K. Chesterton, due to the group's links to the Conservative Party. Jordan further called for the building of a mass party but this too was rejected due to the Tory links. At the time Jordan was also close to the Britons Publishing Society and both groups ran out of Arnold Leese House, the name given to 74 Princedale Road, the Notting Hill home of the late Imperial Fascist League leader which Leese's widow Mary allowed Jordan to use as his base of operations. Mary Leese also provided most of the group's funding.Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p. 162 Because of this shared space with the Britons the WDL was able to publish its own magazine, Black and White News, as soon the group was founded, and it reached a circulation of around 800 with a focus on anti-immigration rhetoric. A further WDL paper, The Nationalist, appeared in 1959, focusing more on anti-Semitism and the desire for racial purity.", "In 1969 the WDL began to co-operate with the National Labour Party, a group led by another former LEL dissident John Bean which was also active in Notting Hill. The WDL helped Bean's group with their election campaigns and the two groups held a joint rally called Stop the Coloured Invasion in Trafalgar Square in May 1969 with banners that read Keep Britain White. Some marchers wore armbands containing the WDL logo \u2014 a white sun wheel within a red circle on a dark blue background. Jordan, who had developed a network of international contacts through The Nationalist, impressed both Bean and Andrew Fountaine and in February 1960 the two groups fused to form the British National Party, which was also to be based at Arnold Leese House."]}, {"page": "Arnold Spencer-Leese", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold Leese"]}]}}
