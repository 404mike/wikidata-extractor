Lloyd was brought in on the wing, opposite Tom Pearson, as a temporary replacement for William Llewellyn Thomas. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales played a good game on a pitch shortened by 20 yards due to a large area of the pitch being frozen. The game finished 5-4 to Scotland, with Wales having a late try disallowed when Frank Mills' score was deemed to have been passed the taped off area. The next game, Thomas returned to the wing position and Lloyd was not selected to represent Wales again."]}]}}
