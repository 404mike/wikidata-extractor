Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes good bows, as used by Native Americans. John Bradbury, a Scottish botanist who had traveled the interior United States extensively in the early 19th century, reported that a bow made of Osage timber could be traded for a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, which can be used as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes. At present, florists use the fruits of M. pomifera for decorative purposes."]}, {"page": "American frontier", "response": ["In 1811, naturalists Thomas Nuttall (1786\u20131859) and John Bradbury (1768\u20131823) traveled up the Missouri River documenting and drawing plant and animal life.Phillip Drennen Thomas, \"The United States Army as the Early Patron of Naturalists in the Trans-Mississippi West, 1803\u20131820\", Chronicles of Oklahoma, (1978) 56#2 pp.\u00a0171\u2013193 Artist George Catlin (1796\u20131872) painted accurate paintings of Native American culture.

In the end Hunt was able to secure Dorion, on the condition that Marie and his two children be brought along as well. Once finalized, he took British naturalists John Bradbury and Thomas Nuttall with him to the Nodaway camp, as previously agreed upon. The party left St. Louis on 12 March and reached Fort Osage on the 8th of April. Early into the travel Dorion physically abused his wife and caused her to flee for a day. At the station Ramsay Crooks was waiting for them and the group recuperated for two days. The group left Fort Osage on the 10th of April and during the day Dorion \"severely beat his squaw\" as Marie desired to stay with newly made Osage acquaintances rather than continue with the expedition.
