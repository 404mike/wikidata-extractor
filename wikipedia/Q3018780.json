In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono.

Reynolds claims it is physically impossible that the Boeing planes of Flights 11 and 175 could have penetrated the steel frames of the Towers, and that digital compositing was used to depict the plane crashes in both news reports and subsequent amateur video. \"There were no planes, there were no hijackers\", Reynolds insists. \"I know, I know, I'm out of the mainstream, but that's the way it is\". According to David Shayler, \"the only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes\", he says, which would be well beyond the capabilities of contemporaneous hologram technology. \"Watch footage frame by frame and you will see a cigar-shaped missile hitting the World Trade Center\". Most no-planes adherents, including Thierry Meyssan and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact.Weekend Live, Fox News, September 10, 2006The Great Derangement, Matt Taibbi, New York, 2009 Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims.
