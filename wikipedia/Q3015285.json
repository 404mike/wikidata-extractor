Series producer Kate Oates spoke at an Emmerdale conference saying: \"Chrissie [Robert's fianc\u00e9e] doesn't know about the relationship with Robert and Aaron, and that's obviously going to be a long-burner. She doesn't know that her husband-to-be has this tendency that he also fancies men, so that might be a big surprise to her!\" In an interview with Digital Spy she also said: \"Robert is very different from his brother in that Andy can live in the terraced house in the village with the girl that he's always loved and be happy. He works as a farmhand on the farm where he grew up, he doesn't need any more and he's a really happy guy like that. Robert always wants more \u2013 there's never enough. He's in a position now where he's with Chrissie and he's in the big house on the hill. He's also got Lawrence in his back pocket now, but it's still not enough. Robert is still taking risks and seeking adrenaline. He just wants more all the time. I think Aaron is going to be a victim of that to a certain extent, but the attraction between them is genuine.\"", "Praising Danny Miller and Ryan Hawley, Oates continued: \"What I really like is that the lads have done a great job of creating that chemistry. In the scenes where they're together, you absolutely believe it and I think that they've done brilliantly with that. It's genuine to a point, but Robert will always be out for himself!\"", "In an interview in December 2015, Danny Miller commented that the \"power of Twitter\" would keep the \"Robron\" storyline going.

I say too much about him, actually \u2013 I think people think I fancy him! But he's great \u2013 he's really good, and I think they know that. They've shelved the storyline for now, but I think they're quite keen to see it again.\"", "Following Robert and Aaron's engagement in October 2016, producer Iain MacLeod was asked at a press conference if the wedding would be a \"big event\", he responded: \"In keeping with their characters, I don't think anybody is expecting dancing girls and show tunes. It's quite raw and honest, and it has got a healthy dose of Dingle craziness at the heart of it that threatens to derail things. It is huge emotional territory, but it's not dancing girls and 'Dancing Queen'. It is kind of more Robert and Aaron than that, which I hope people will like. It's happening next year.\" Danny Miller, who plays Aaron, was also present at the press conference \u2013 so this was all news to him, as he hasn't read the wedding script at the time. Danny said: \"I was just listening in! I haven't read anything myself yet. Like Iain said, it's next year. We only really get scripts about two or three weeks before we record them, so I've not read anything yet. I think Iain's right that it would be against the characters if it was too big, or a stereotypical big pink wedding.

Victoria was thrilled, thinking she and Daz were a couple now but Daz told her that he wasn't going to dump Scarlett. He felt guilty about cheating on Scarlett and told Victoria that it was a mistake and they should forget about it. Victoria hoped Daz would change his mind but when he didn't, Victoria told him that she was pregnant, just as he and Scarlett were going away for a weekend. The weekend was a disaster as he kept thinking of Victoria and on his return, Daz took Victoria for a drive. He told Victoria that she'd have to see a doctor and that people would think he was a pervert if they announced that she was expecting his baby, so Victoria admitted she'd lied. Furious, Daz moved back into Dale View with Jake. Knowing Daz would be annoyed, Victoria reconciled with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). In May, Aaron and Victoria slept together and, thinking Daz and Jake would be at work, she \"borrowed\" Jake's keys and took Aaron to Dale View.
