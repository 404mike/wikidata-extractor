Desmond's name is a tribute to David Hume, the famous empiricist philosopher. Desmond was not a passenger of Flight 815. He had been stranded on the island three years prior to the crash as the result of a shipwreck. Desmond eventually leaves the Island with the Oceanic 6 and is reunited with his love Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger).\nIt appears that Desmond was the \"package\" that Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) was talking about on Hydra Island. It was later revealed by Charles Widmore that Desmond was Jacob's \"fail-safe\", meaning that in case the Man in Black killed all of Jacob's candidates, Desmond would then be used to destroy the island.\nDesmond was one of the show's most popular characters. In 2006 Cusick's portrayal was nominated for an Emmy. In 2007 a two-week-long tournament-style competition for Lost's best character, with over 6,000 voters, hosted by The Washington Post voted Desmond the winner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hume", "response": ["* Desmond Hume, a fictional character on the television series Lost"]}, {"page": "Our Mutual Friend", "response": ["* 2004\u20142010.

He cannot leave the island as long as Jacob or one of his successors is still on the island and we are told that if he does leave the island, everyone on earth will die. He first appears as a cloud of black smoke, but can apparently take on the appearance of anyone who is dead. In his Locke avatar, which we are told he cannot now change, he takes offense when Ben calls him a Monster.  He claims that he is not evil, and just wants to escape the island. Thus, he begins to recruit allies to escape with him such as Sawyer, Claire, Sayid, and Kate. According to Rousseau and Ben, the Man in Black (in his Monster form) serves as a security system and judge to the Island.  He has limitations. He cannot penetrate the DHARMA sonar fence, go through the ash that surrounds Jacob's cabin, or enter the temple while a guardian is alive. He cannot personally kill Jacob or any of the candidates chosen by Jacob to succeed him. He manipulates Ben, by impersonating Locke and Ben's daughter, and eventually convinces Ben to kill Jacob.

When a man named \"Henry Gale\" (Michael Emerson) arrives in the jungle (captured in a trap set by Danielle Rousseau), Locke holds him prisoner in the empty armory.

Locke and the other survivors soon find out that Henry was lying about his identity and he is a member of The Others, but he refuses to speak to anyone but Locke.
