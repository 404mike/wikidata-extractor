The pair were 'convening' for the purpose of thinking of solutions to problems stemming from the fact that they had lost control of the Artful Dodger name, including the issue that those who had established themselves in their stead were answering interview questions as though they were responsible for the creation of the Artful Dodger music, which was making it difficult for them to get bookings. As a consequence of the unexpected positive response to the possibility of a reunion of the original duo, in 2017, Mark Hill and Pete Devereux formally announced the reestablishment of their creative partnership, reuniting as Original Dodger.Jaguar,  Leading the charge was the 2017 single, \"Millionaire\".John Twells,  News indicated that an '11 track release' was due to emerge, titled Soundtrack, and a tracklist was published.Jaguar,  Soundtrack was to take the form of a 'mixtape', and was to serve as the precursor to an album release.
