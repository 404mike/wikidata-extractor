He was predominantly selected by Nottinghamshire as a right-handed batsman and a not-very-successful fast bowler and, with one exception, his career was unspectacular. Over the 179 innings of his career, he passed 50 runs only 14 times, and converted just one of those 50s to a century.\nAlletson secured his place in cricket history with one record-breaking innings played against Sussex County Cricket Club in May 1911. The innings rescued the game for Nottinghamshire and became known as Alletson's Innings. He never repeated this success. His career ended three years later, when he was 30, when cricket was suspended at the onset of World War I. He died in 1963, aged 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garfield Sobers", "response": ["On 31 August 1968, Sobers became the first batsman ever to hit six sixes in a single over of six consecutive balls in first-class cricket. Sobers hit the first four balls cleanly out of the ground but was caught on his fifth attempt by Roger Davis on the boundary at long-off. However, while doing so, Davis fell on his back and landed on the line. Umpire Eddie Phillipson ruled that Davis had carried the ball over the boundary and signalled six. Sobers then smashed the next ball - the sixth ball of the over - clean over the East Terrace of the St. Helen's Cricket Ground. As commentator Wilf Wooller put it: \"And he\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it! And my goodness, it\u2019s gone ... way down to Swansea!\" Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea; the unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash. This tally of 36 runs in an over broke a 57-year-old record of 34 runs, held by Ted Alletson. The ball was collected from a garden by 11-year-old Richard Lewis; he later gave the ball to Sobers. In 1984\u201385, Indian batsman Ravi Shastri equalled the record by scoring six sixes in an over while playing for Bombay versus Baroda."]}, {"page": "Alletson's Innings", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Alletson"]}, {"page": "Alletson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Alletson"]}, {"page": "Edwin Alletson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Alletson"]}, {"page": "Edwin alletson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Alletson"]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 34 || 4\u00a06\u00a06\u00a00\u00a04\u00a04\u00a04\u00a06(2 no-balls) || Ted Alletson (Nottinghamshire) || Ernest Killick (Sussex) || Sussex v NottinghamshireNottinghamshire won the toss and batted first, scoring 238 (Ernest Killick took five for 14).
