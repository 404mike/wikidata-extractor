He lives and works in London.\nThe constant characteristics of Charlton's work, such as the use of grey and the definition of the geometry of forms, are summarised in the statement: \"I am an artist who makes a grey painting\". Speaking of his work in an interview, the artist explains: \"Paintings are always made in the same way. The size is 4.5 cm, the canvas is always the same type of cotton and the color is always gray. With these elements, which always remain unchanged, I try to create different works\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Foksal Gallery", "response": ["*Alan Charlton"]}, {"page": "Art & Project", "response": ["The following artists were involved with the gallery (and the bulletin): Barry Flanagan, Douglas Huebler, Lawrence Weiner, Sol LeWitt, Robert Barry, Carl Andre, Alan Charlton (artist), Joseph Kosuth, Richard Long, Andrew Lord, Stanley Brouwn, Gilbert & George, Alighiero Boetti, Francesco Clemente, Allen Ruppersberg, Marcel Broodthaers, John Baldessari, Hamish Fulton, Jan Dibbets, Ian Wilson, Bas Jan Ader, Han Schuil and Daniel Buren."]}, {"page": "Alan Charlton", "response": ["Alan Charlton  (born 21 June 1952) is a British former diplomat who was ambassador to Brazil 2008\u20132013.
