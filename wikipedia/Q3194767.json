He played for Scotland forty four times between 1978 and 1989. He played at both wing and centre, the latter twenty times out of his forty four caps.Richard Bath writes of him that:\n\nKeith Robertson never possessed the acceleration which usually marks out the great wings. Yet what he lacked in out-and-out pace he more than made up for in guile and sheer footballing ability. An accomplished Sevens player, the willowy Melrose wing - he was a shade under 11 stone - was also a prolific try scorer at every level except international. During his Scotland career which spanned eleven years, Robertson only managed to score eight tries.\"\nKeith Robertson was a major part of Scotland's Grand Slam in 1984.He was never selected for the British Lions.After retiring he became involved in Borders rugby, and was one of the major Scottish advocates of professionalism in rugby union.He occasionally appears on STV's rugby programme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Robertson", "response": ["Keith Robertson may refer to:", "* Keith Robertson (writer) (1914\u20131991), American writer of children's books and murder mysteries", "* Keith Robertson (rugby union, born 1954), former Scottish rugby union player", "* Keith Robertson (Australian footballer) (born 1938), former Australian rules footballer", "* Keith Robertson (rugby union coach), rugby player"]}, {"page": "1983 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Keith Robertson"]}, {"page": "1980 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Keith Robertson"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Scottish Inter-District Championship", "response": ["South: Peter Dods (Gala), Roger Baird (Kelso), Keith Murray (Hawick), Keith Robertson (Melrose), Iwan Tukalo (Selkirk), John Rutherford (Selkirk), Roy Laidlaw (Jedforest), K.
