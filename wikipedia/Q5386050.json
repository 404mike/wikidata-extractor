Over the span of his career he came to be known as one of the best centres in the modern game and formed a devastating partnership with Billy Boston somewhat because of this combination he went on to represent the Great Britain national side making his d\u00e9but in 1957. After his retirement from playing rugby league in 1969, Ashton went on to coach Wigan as well as Leeds, St. Helens, England and Great Britain; he also had a brief stint as chairman of St Helens in 1996. He was a member of the St Helens board for fifteen years.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 24", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Eric Ashton, English rugby player and coach (d. 2008)"]}, {"page": "1960 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["*  Eric Ashton"]}, {"page": "Great Britain national rugby league team", "response": ["In 1960, the World Cup was played on home soil. The tournament is decided on a league system but with both Great Britain and Australia undefeated, the last match became a virtual World Cup Final.

The British Lions won the opening two Tests 31\u201312 and then 17\u201310, the first time in 34 years that they had won the first two matches on Australian soil. The first Test was played before more than 70,000 spectators. The third Test was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 14 July 1962. A controversial last-minute Australian try and the subsequent touchline conversion resulted in a 17\u201318 defeat; but for this, the 62 Lions would have been the first team to achieve a whitewash of the Australians.", "The tour of Australasia in 1979 was a disastrous one in many ways. A number of players withdrew because of injury, and coach Eric Ashton was unable to fly out with his squad because his daughter had been involved in a car crash. Injuries during the tour caused three influential players to return home early, whilst attendance figures at tour matches were disappointing due to the lacklustre performances of the tourists, and led to a financial loss of over \u00a3300,000 on the trip. The Australian's, coached by Frank Stanton and captained by George Peponis, won the series 3\u20130. Australian centre Michael Cronin scored a total of 54 points for the series with two tries and 24 goals. Incredibly he outscored the Lions who only scored 18 points for the entire series, losing the first test 35\u20130 in Brisbane, and the second and third tests 24\u201316 and 28\u20132 in Sydney. Total attendance for the series was just 66,752 compared to the 133,791 who saw the three tests on the 1974 Lions tour. Critics from both Britain and Australia called the team the weakest and least committed touring side ever to tour Australia and that poor results had been the cause of such a dramatic drop in attendances."]}, {"page": "England national rugby league team", "response": ["* Eric Ashton"]}, {"page": "Leeds Rhinos", "response": ["Eric Ashton (former Wigan and Great Britain centre) coached Leeds for the 1973\u201374 season before leaving to coach St. Helens."]}, {"page": "Wigan Warriors", "response": ["In 1953 Wigan signed Billy Boston for \u00a3150. 8,000 fans saw Billy Boston d\u00e9but for Wigan in the 'A' team.

Jim Challinor took over from Cliff Evans in 1970, and in his first season, he won the Championship, and reached two finals, the Lancashire Cup and Floodlit Trophy, losing both. In this season, a European Championship\u2014not dissimilar to today's World Club Challenge\u2014was contested between St Helens and French champions St Gaudens. Over a two\u2014legged game, St Helens won 92\u201311 on aggregate. In their first Challenge Cup Final of the 1970s, they defeated Leeds in 1972 16\u201313, in addition to winning their first Floodlit Trophy, after losing out in the final three times before, with an 8\u20132 win over Rochdale. The club reached the Championship final in that season, but were beaten. No success was achieved in seasons 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374, with St Helens finishing third and second in the respective years. This could be a possible reason for Jim Challinor's replacement with Eric Ashton as head coach. In Ashton's first season in charge, St Helens won the Championship, and contested the inaugural Premiership Final, losing 26\u201311 to Leeds. They repeated their first Challenge Cup success of the 1970s three years after the first against Widnes in 1976 where they were victorious by 20\u20135 in the famous 'Dads Army' final. They also won the Premiership against Salford, and the Floodlit Trophy against Dewsbury in a successful season. In the same year, St Helens lost to Eastern Suburbs in an unofficial World Club Challenge Final by 25 points to 2. The club won the Premiership in 1977, but, on 13 December 1977, Saints lost 26\u201311 to Hull Kingston Rovers in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. In 1978 Leeds avenged their 1972 loss against St Helens, emerging winners by 14\u201312. St Helens lost the Floodlit Trophy in the 1978\u201379 season, going down to Widnes.

They are usually positioned just inside the wingers and are typically the second-closest players to the touch-line on each side of the field. In attack their primary role is to provide an attacking threat out wide and as such they often need to be some of the fastest players on the pitch, often providing the pass for their winger to finish off a move. In defence, they are expected to mark their opposite centre. Centres that feature in their countries' halls of fame are France's Max Rousi\u00e9, England's Eric Ashton, Harold Wagstaff and Neil Fox, Wales' Gus Risman and Australia's Reg Gasnier, H \"Dally\" Messenger, Dave Brown, Jim Craig, Bob Fulton and Mal Meninga."]}, {"page": "Uncle Joe's Mint Balls", "response": ["British singer/songwriter and humorist Mike Harding has a song called \"Uncle Joe's Mint Balls\" on his 1975 album Mrs. 'Ardin's Kid.

Along with Eric Ashton the best centre I\u2019ve ever seen. He was very fast and very deceptive. You never knew what he would do next. He'd be running straight and then veer left or right.\" Upon Gasnier's retirement then ARL chairman Bill Buckley said, \"[In] his day, he was the greatest rugby league player I have ever seen. Gasnier had an amazing change of pace and great anticipation. He was also particularly unselfish. He was without peer.\""]}]}}
