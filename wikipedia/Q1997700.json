He was one of the members of the English Madrigal School, but also composed sacred music.\nLittle is known of the details of his life, though some of his contacts can be inferred.  He worked at Rushbrooke Hall near Bury St Edmunds, evidently as a tutor to the daughters of Sir Robert Jermyn.  In 1598 he married Anne Saxye, afterwards moving to Bury St Edmunds.  Around this time he probably made the acquaintance of John Wilbye, a much more famous madrigalist, who lived and worked only a few miles away, and whose style he sometimes approaches.  In 1626 his wife died, and he is known to have been a churchwarden at St Mary's Church, Bury St Edmunds during the next several years until his death.\n\nKirbye's most significant musical contributions were the psalm settings he wrote for East's psalter, The Whole Book of Psalmes (1592), the madrigals he wrote for the Triumphs of Oriana (1601), the famous collection dedicated to Elizabeth I, and an independent set of madrigals published in 1597. Kirbye was employed by East to arrange tunes featured in his psalter, and it is his arrangement, with the melody in the tenor, of Tye's melody to accompany Psalm 84 \"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place\" which is today sung to While Shepherds watched their flocks by night.Stylistically, his madrigals have more in common with the Italian models provided by Marenzio than do many of the others by his countrymen: they tend to be serious, in a minor mode, and show a careful attention to text setting; unlike Marenzio, however, he is restrained in his specific imagery.\nKirbye avoided the light style of Morley, which was hugely popular, and brought into the madrigal serious style of pre-madrigal English music.  He is not as often sung as Morley, Weelkes or Wilbye, but neither was he as prolific; still, some of his madrigals appear in modern collections, such as the Oxford Book of English Madrigals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1565", "response": ["** George Kirbye, English composer (d. 1634)"]}, {"page": "1597 in music", "response": ["*George Kirbye \u2013 The first set Of English Madrigalls, to 4. 5. & 6. voyces (London: Thomas Este)"]}, {"page": "English Madrigal School", "response": ["* George Kirbye (c 1565\u20131634)"]}, {"page": "The Triumphs of Oriana", "response": ["| George Kirbye"]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* George Kirbye (1565\u20131634)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*George Kirbye (c. 1565 \u2013 1634)"]}, {"page": "1634 in music", "response": ["*October \u2013 George Kirbye, composer (born c.1565)"]}, {"page": "The Oxford Book of English Madrigals", "response": ["| George Kirbye || See what a maze of error"]}, {"page": "While shepherds watched their flocks", "response": ["George Kirbye, an East Anglian madrigalist about whom little is known, was employed by Este to arrange tunes featured in his The Whole Book of Psalmes and it is his arrangement of Tye's work that appears in the psalter to accompany Psalm 84 \"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place\" with the melody in the tenor.

The tunes were harmonised by ten eminent composers. They are Richard Allison, E. Blancks, Michael Cavendish, William Cobbold, John Douland, John Farmer, Giles Farnaby, Edmund Hooper, Edward Johnson, and George Kirbye. The title of the first edition runs:", "From this it is plain that the psalter is an early example of what musicians now call \"score\" as distinguished from the \"part-books\", each of which contained a separate part, so that a whole set of books was always necessary before a madrigal or other composition contained in them could be sung. The book affords also an early instance of the practice of calling tunes by various names: \"Glassenburie Tune\", \"Kentish Tune\", and \"Chesshire Tune\" are thus distinguished. The psalter is dedicated to Sir John Puckering, who was lord keeper of the great seal, and a dedication and preface are written by East. The second edition, the earliest known to Burney and Hawkins, is dated 1594, and a third appeared in 1604. In 1593 Thomas Morley's Canzonets, or Little Short Songs to three Voyces, was issued, and in 1594 the same composer's Madrigalls to foure Voyces. The year after this the five-part ballets and the two-part canzonets of the same composer were published. On 22 January 1596 Byrd's patent expired, and East for the next two years did business on his own account exclusively. On 22 Sep of that year A brief introduction to the skill of songe concerning the practise sett forth by William Bath, gent., was transferred to East from Abel Jeffes, by whom it had been printed in 1584, and on 24 Nov he issued George Kirbye's madrigals."]}, {"page": "List of compositions by Imogen Holst", "response": ["|Choral ||align=center|1966 ||George Kirbye: \"O Jesu, Look\"||SSATB voices||"]}, {"page": "Kirbye, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Kirbye"]}, {"page": "George Kirby (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George Kirbye (c. 1565\u20131634), English composer"]}]}}
