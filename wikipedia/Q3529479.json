Though scarcely comparable in method to the giants of the past because of the changed type of most bowlers met in these days, Keeton developed the highest art in defence and run-getting. Possessed of all the strokes, he was especially strong in such attractive features in a batsman's make-up as cutting and off-driving... Keeton, if slow to mature, found himself at the age of 28 in his third full season with the County, mentioned with William Gunn, George Gunn and Arthur Shrewsbury.\" He scored more than 1000 runs in August 1933 alone, with six centuries in the month, including four in five innings.
