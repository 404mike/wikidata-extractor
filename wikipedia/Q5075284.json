B. Cochran, was an English theatrical manager and impresario.  He produced some of the most successful musical revues, musicals and plays of the 1920s and 1930s, becoming associated with No\u00ebl Coward and his works.\nAfter beginning his career as an actor in America about 1890, Cochran became a manager and press agent for vaudeville, legitimate theatre and other entertainments.  He returned to England by 1902 producing theatre, variety shows and revues.  By the end of the First World War, he was producing shows at the Oxford Music Hall, including the surprise hit The Better 'Ole.  In addition to producing several No\u00ebl Coward works, Cochran introduced or promoted such stars as Beatrice Lillie, Gertrude Lawrence, Coward, Jessie Matthews, Yvonne Printemps, Lizbeth Webb and Effie Atherton.  He also produced the Ballets Russes and, for 12 years, managed the Royal Albert Hall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cavalcade (play)", "response": ["The play was premiered in London in 1931 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, directed by the author. The spectacular production presented by the impresario Charles B. Cochran, involved a huge cast and massive sets. The play was very successful and ran for almost a year. It took advantage of the large stage of the Drury Lane Theatre with its hydraulics and moving components to dramatise the events.  "]}, {"page": "George Balanchine", "response": ["After Diaghilev's death, the Ballets Russes went bankrupt. To earn money, Balanchine began to stage dances for Charles B. Cochran's revues and Sir Oswald Stoll's variety shows in London. He was retained by the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen as a guest ballet master. Among his new works for the company were Danses Concertantes, a pure dance piece to music by Stravinsky, and Night Shadow, revived under the title La Sonnambula, the haunting tale of a poet who falls in love with a mysterious and alluring sleepwalker."]}, {"page": "Jessie Matthews", "response": ["Matthews' fame reached its initial height with her lead role in Charles B. Cochran's 1930 stage production of Ever Green, which premiered at the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow. The musical, by Rodgers and Hart, was partly inspired by the life of music hall star Marie Lloyd and her daughter's tribute act resurrection of her mother's acclaimed Edwardian stage show as Marie Lloyd Junior. At its time, Ever Green, which included the first major revolving stage in Britain,\"Alhambra Glasgow\" by Graeme Smith  was the most expensive musical ever mounted on a British stage."]}, {"page": "A. P. Herbert", "response": ["From July 1945 to 1946, Herbert worked on the libretto for Charles B. Cochran's new musical, Big Ben. It opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, Montgomery, Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran himself was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high and so there was no fortune in it for Cochran or for Herbert.Pound, pp. 199\u2013201. Its run was over at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.Pound, p. 207. Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, Bless the Bride, which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two-and-a-quarter years, was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert, and was being Cochran's most successful musical.Pound, p. 211. It includes the hit song 'Ma Belle Marguerite'."]}, {"page": "George Hackenschmidt", "response": ["In 1925, Charles B. Cochran recounted that he once invited Hackenschmidt to dine at his flat in Piccadilly.Cochran, Charles Blake. (1925). The Secrets of a Showman. W. Heinemann. p. 117 Cochran noted that Hackenschmidt ate \"eight or nine eggs, a porterhouse-steak, and a whole Camembert cheese\". Journalist Maurice Richardson commented that Hackenschmidt was a considerable meat eater during the height of his wrestling career and would eat steak and half a dozen eggs as a snack but did not eat tinned foods.Richardson, Maurice. (1979). Fits & Starts: Collected Pieces. Michael Joseph. p. 120.  \"A natural born ascetic, Hackenschmidt has lived almost the whole of his life in training. He is a teetotaller and a non-smoker. The only cigarette he ever smoked put him flat on his back after a few puffs. At the height of his wrestling career he was a considerable meat eater, his idea of a light snack before dinner was a steak and half a dozen eggs. But he always eschewed tinned foods. For many years now he has been a strict vegetarian\". In opposition to this, sportswriter Lew Freedman has written that Hackenschmidt rarely ate meat and did not like cooked food.Freedman, Lew. (2018). Pro Wrestling: A Comprehensive Reference Guide. ABC-Clio. p. 108.  \"He followed a vegetarian diet of fruits, nuts and raw vegetables and drank 11 pints of milk per day.

The cast included Jeanne Aubert as Reno Sweeney (the name changed to Reno La Grange, to suit Aubert's French background), Jack Whiting as Billy Crocker, and Sydney Howard as Moonface Martin. P. G.

Cochran. Cochran took Hackenschmidt under his wing and booked him into a match in which Hackenschmidt defeated another top British wrestler, Tom Cannon, for the European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship. This win gave Hackenschmidt a credible claim to the world title, cemented in 1905 with a win over American Heavyweight Champion Tom Jenkins in the United States. Hackenschmidt took a series of bookings in Manchester for a then impressive \u00a3150 a week. Noting Hackenschmidt's legitimately dominant style of wrestling threatened to kill crowd interest, Cochran persuaded Hackenschmidt to learn showmanship from Cannon and wrestle many of his matches for entertainment rather than sport; this displayed the future elements of \"sports entertainment\"."]}, {"page": "Jack Buchanan", "response": ["Buchanan's American stage appearances included: Andr\u00e9 Charlot's Revues, Charles B.
