If decentralized socialism cannot work, central authorities must plan production. However, central planners face the local knowledge problem in forming a comprehensive plan for production. Mises and Hayek saw centralization as inevitable in socialism. Opponents argued that in principle an economy can be seen as a set of equations. Thus, there should be no need for prices. Using information about available resources and the preferences of people, it should be possible to calculate an optimal solution for resource allocation. Friedrich von Hayek responded that the system of equations required too much information that would not be easily available and the ensuing calculations would be too difficult. This is partly because individuals possess useful knowledge but do not realise its importance, may have no incentive to transmit the information, or may have incentive to transmit false information about their preferences. He contended that the only rational solution is to utilize all the dispersed knowledge in the market place through the use of price signals. The early debates were made before the much greater calculating powers of modern computers became available but also before research on chaos theory. In the 1980s, Alexander Nove argued that the calculations would take millions of years even with the best computers. It may be impossible to make long-term predictions for a highly complex system such as an economy.Bergstra, Jan. \"Economic Logic: A Survey and Variations on the Theme\".  Utrecht University, Department of Philosophy, section Theoretical Philosophy, group of Applied Logic. Retrieved 4 January 2015.", "Some academics and economists argue that the claim a free market is efficient, or even the most efficient, method of resource allocation is incorrect. Alexander Nove argued that Mises \"tends to spoil his case by the implicit assumption that capitalism and optimum resource allocation go together\" in Mises' \"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\". Joan Robinson argued that many prices in modern capitalism are effectively \"administered prices\" created by \"quasi monopolies\", thus challenging the connection between capital markets and rational resource allocation. Robin Hahnel argued that free markets are in fact systematically inefficient because externalities are pervasive and because real-world markets are rarely truly competitive or in equilibrium.Hahnel, Robin (2007). \"The Case Against Markets\". Journal of Economic Issues. 41 (4): 1139\u20131159. Socialist market abolitionists argue that whilst advocates of capitalism and the Austrian School in particular recognize equilibrium prices do not exist, they nonetheless claim that these prices can be used as a rational basis when this is not the case, hence markets are not efficient."]}, {"page": "Mixed economy", "response": ["Mixed economies understood as a mixture of socially owned and private enterprise have been predicted and advocated by various socialists as a necessary transitional form between capitalism and socialism. Additionally, a number of proposals for socialist systems call for a mixture of different forms of enterprise ownership including a role for private enterprise. For example, Alexander Nove's conception of feasible socialism outlines an economic system based on a combination of state-enterprises for large industries, worker and consumer cooperatives, private enterprises for small-scale operations and individually owned enterprises.Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan \u2013 Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html"]}, {"page": "Soviet and Communist studies", "response": ["As summarized by David R.

Hence, its supporters called themselves the Conservative Party while its opponents called themselves the National Liberal Party and the Socialist Workers' Party. Historian Alexander Nove argued that social ownership through government can only occur if the government is socially controlled which was not the case where an emperor rules by the will of God as in Germany since the Emperor was not the public.

In \"Why I Am Not a Conservative\", Friedrich Hayek explained that \"[t]here are, however, two economic and philosophical estimates of society with which State Socialism may be brought into broad contrast\", namely liberalism and socialism.Hayek, Friedrich; Hamowy, Ronald, ed. (2011) [1960]. \"Why I am Not a Conservative\". The Constitution of Liberty: The Definitive Edition. Chicago: Chicago University Press. pp. 1\u20132. . According to journalist William Harbutt Dawson, an acknowledged expert on German politics and society, \"[t]he great disagreement between Socialism and State Socialism is that the former would entirely subvert the State, while the latter accepts its political form as it is. Socialism would abolish the existing order altogether, while State Socialism would use the State for the accomplishment of great economic and social purposes, especially restoring to it the function, which Frederick the Great held to be the principal business of the State, of 'holding the balance [...] between classes and parties\"."]}, {"page": "List of Jewish historians", "response": ["*Alexander Nove, economic historian (Jewish Year Book 1990 p.\u00a0202)"]}, {"page": "List of Jews born in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union", "response": ["* Alexander Nove, economistJewish Year Book, 1990, p.\u00a0202"]}, {"page": "Criticism of communist party rule", "response": ["The authors of The Black Book of Communism, Norman Davies, Rummel and others have attempted to give estimates of the total number of deaths for which communist rule of a particular state in a particular period was responsible, or the total for all states under communist rule.
