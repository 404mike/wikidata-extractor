Born on 29 September 1964, he studied for his PhD under Christine Carpenter, researching politics and the English constitution during the reign of King Henry VI, which was awarded in early 1991. He had joined Merton College, Oxford, the previous year as a junior research fellow, and from there became a lecturer at the University of Aberystwyth. He returned to Oxford in 1997, joining Corpus Christi College as a fellow and tutor in medieval history. He has described the context of his interests \u2013 Henry VI \u2013 as \"a famously useless king, who came to the throne as a baby and ruled with astonishing inertness for a further thirty-nine years\".

An arbitration took place; or, at least, a decision was imposed upon them, even if an \"unworkable\" one, according to the historian John Watts. Bonville was by now fifty years old and had not been abroad for nearly 20 years, but in 1443 the council\u2014probably hoping another stint in France would \"divert his ample energies from the West Country\"\u2014appointed him seneschal of Gascony. He was not the government's only option for the post: his own retainer Sir Philip Chetwynd had been governing Guyenne since the previous November. The council intended that Courtenay should also help relieve Avranches, although in the event he did not do so. Accompanied by Sir John Popham\u2014a \"reliable and experienced\" soldier\u2014Bonville sailed in March the following year. He had indentured to provide 20 men-at-arms and 600 archers as an advance-guard to a larger expeditionary force. King Henry presented him with a personal gift of \u00a3100 towards his campaign expenses. Yet it is almost certain that their fleet did not leave Plymouth for many more months. Griffiths has suggested that by now, \"the time had passed when a modest-sized army like Bonville's would do\". Its size had been limited by the fact that the vast majority of the men raised by the Crown were despatched to Normandy, which was considered more important. At least one ship and men (possibly amounting to a third of his army) and materiel was lost en route. Bonville focussed on assaulting the harbour, fleet and town of La Rochelle itself (French chroniclers referred to Bonville as a corsair). His campaign achieved little, and Bonville himself was seriously injured in a skirmish.", "The House of Lords eventually appointed the Duke of York as protector of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury chancellor. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate; indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the south-west coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered."]}, {"page": "Thomas de la More", "response": ["King Henry VI was six-months old when his father, Henry V, died in 1422.

Of this, de la More availed himself."]}, {"page": "John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont", "response": ["Born at Folkingham Castle, the eldest son of Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont, and orphaned by the age of four,Cockayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage II, ed. H.E. Doubleday (London, 1912), 62. Beaumont became Henry V's ward, who quickly put him in the custody of Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester. On 24 July 1425 his marriage rights were granted by the council to Sir John Radcliffe as part-payment for debts owed him by the crown.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981) He was first summoned to parliament as Lord Beaumont in 1431, and at some point between 1425 and 1436 he married Elizabeth Phelip. She was the daughter and heiress of Sir William Phelip, a knight of the Garter who was recognised as sixth Lord Bardolf. On his death in 1441, his large East Anglian estates went to his daughter, and so to Viscount Beaumont. This made him a leading figure in the region. Combined with his own inheritance in Leicestershire, he was a figure worthy of the association of William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (died 1450) and from there entered the household of King Henry VI.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), 190.  In 1429 Beaumont was knighted by the seven-year-old king on the eve of his coronationGrummitt, D., Henry VI (Oxford, 2013), 75. and was in France with Henry the following year.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 279 Dr. John Watts has suggested that, as a royal ward, he may have been brought up in the king's household as a young man, and that his later generous treatment was a consequence of this. Watts  noted that a council act of 1425 brought wards of his status 'permanently about the king.'", "By 1440 he was firmly in the king's favour, being made in succession the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440),Goodwin, page 65 possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to himGriffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 356 and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, appointed a Knight of the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts.Hicks, M.A., English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century (London, 2002), p. 55 These consistent promotions and favouritism have been the subject of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king,Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 118 and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Queen Margaret in 1448.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 271 n. 135"]}, {"page": "Titles of distinction awarded by the University of Oxford", "response": ["* John Watts, Professor of Later Medieval History"]}, {"page": "Loveday, 1458", "response": ["Wolffe has argued that Henry's decision was no more than \"a formal accord on the limited issue of atonement and compensation\". Changing the attitudes of individuals towards their enemies was considered more important than the question of compensation, important though that was. Furthermore, York and Warwick's payments to the families of their enemies were not in cash; rather, they were to renounce debts owed them by the crown which amounted to similar sums. To fulfil their obligations, York and the Nevilles merely had to return government-issued tallies which entitled them to receive the required sum. The Yorkists, for their part, were declared to be the King's \"true lieges\", although any reassurance they took from this, comments the medievalist John Watts, may have been tempered by the knowledge that so also had been the three dead lords of St Albans."]}]}}
