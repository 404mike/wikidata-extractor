Bennet was first selected to represent his adopted country as part of the 1891 Home Nations Championship, brought into the pack to face England in the opening game of the tournament. Bennett was one of three newly capped forwards, joining Edward Pegge and Harry Packer in their first international. In a close game, Wales lost 3-7, but the selectors kept faith with Bennett and he was reselected for the next game away to Scotland. Wales lost this game heavily, in a year that saw Scotland eventually win the championship and take the Triple Crown. The selectors reacted to the defeat by switching out half of the pack, replacing them with new caps; Bennett was one of the players to lose his position. Although not picked for the opening match of the 1892 Championship, Bennett was back in favour for the last two matches of the series, replacing Rowley Thomas. Despite the quality in the Welsh team, including their returning captain Arthur Gould, the Welsh were again beaten. The final game of the tournament, was a Wooden Spoon decider away to Ireland. Bennett was joined in this game by fellow Harlequins team-mate Frederick Nicholls, who played on the wing. The game ended in a loss, the first time Wales had lost all three Championship matches, and Bennett's international career ended in a poor, played four, lost four record."]}]}}
