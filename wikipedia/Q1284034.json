He was educated at the Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells and St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was Keeper of Coins and Medals at Fitzwilliam Museum from 1991 to 2011, Reader in Numismatics and Monetary History at the University of Cambridge from 2004 to 2011, and a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 2005.

However, in 1998, the same year that their discussion was published, another Cross-and-Lozenge penny struck in Ceolwulf's name came to light, which appears to be contemporary with Alfred's earliest coinage.Mark Blackburn revisits the issue in his \"Alfred's coinage reforms in context.\" In Alfred the Great.

Unfortunately, because very few coins bear any form of legend and there was extensive imitation and copying, it is extremely difficult to assign dates and minting-places to many of the types and series identified by modern scholars. These are arranged into lettered series according to the scheme of Stuart Rigold, devised in the 1960s and 70s, and sometimes by the numbers applied to types in the British Museum catalogues of the 1880s and expanded thereafter to around 150 different varieties. The current chronology, basically laid down by Mark Blackburn in the mid-1980s, rests on the large Cimiez hoard from southern Gaul, which contained sceattas of several secondary types alongside local issues of named rulers that allowed the hoard to be dated c. 715/20."]}, {"page": "Burghal Hidage", "response": ["in Archaeology and History 13. p. 130. Bath was technically in Mercia at the time [but] defended the South and South Western part of Hwicce. The view that the Burghal Hidage is of early 10th century date is based on the inclusion of Buckingham and Oxford, two settlements that were sited in Mercia not Wessex, and according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Buckingham was created as a burh by Edward the Elder in 918.Tait. Medieval English Borough. p 16Anglo Saxon Chronicle. 918. .....in the same year, before Martinmas, went King Edward to Buckingham with his army, and sat there four weeks, during which he built the two forts... The Chronicle also reports that Edward the Elder took possession of London and Oxford in 910; Buckingham being situated between the two would have also been included.Anglo Saxon Chronicle. 910. It is possible that the Burghal Hideage was created as a blue-print for the way that burhs were connected with hidation, originally worked out in Wessex, and applied to the situation in Mercia at that time.

He remained an almost daily visitor to the coin room, adding new specimens to his collection and meeting visitors, until very shortly before his death.
