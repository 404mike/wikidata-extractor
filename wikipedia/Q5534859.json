According to Regan, the lopsided Japanese victory at Tsushima:...created a legend that was to haunt Japan's leaders for forty years. A British admiral once said, 'It takes three years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition.' Japan thought that the victory had completed this task in a matter of a few years ... It had all been too easy. Looking at T\u014dg\u014d's victory over one of the world's great powers convinced some Japanese military men that with more ships, and bigger and better ones, similar victories could be won throughout the Pacific. Perhaps no power could resist the Japanese navy, not even Britain and the United States."]}, {"page": "Phoney War", "response": ["When Leopold Amery suggested to Kingsley Wood that the Black Forest be bombed with incendiaries to burn its ammunition dumps, Wood\u2014the Secretary of State for Air\u2014amazed the member of parliament by responding that the forest was \"private property\" and could not be bombed; neither could weapons factories, as the Germans might do the same.

The centre lines saw the heaviest fighting. As Thucydides reports, the Boeotian left wing was surrounded and close to defeat, and only the Thespian contingent stood its ground. The victorious Athenian line got into confusion as it circled round the Thespian contingent and surrounded it. Some of the Athenian hoplites fought and killed one another when they met at the other end, mistaking their countrymen for the enemy. That was history's first documented incident of \"friendly fire\" (Geoffrey Regan, Back Fire, Robson Books Ltd., London, 1995). It is thought the incident occurred in part because no \"state\" shield devices were in use, which did not seem to have become general until the Second Battle of Mantinea, fought in 362 BC between the Thebans and the Spartans (and each side's allies) . In any case, Pagondas sent his cavalry to support the Boeotian left wing and the Athenians were defeated in turn. Meanwhile, the Boeotian right wing was also victorious, and the Athenians fighting there fled. When the Athenian centre saw that its two wings had been defeated, it also fled. About 500 Boeotians and 1,000 Athenians had been killed, including Hippocrates."]}, {"page": "Battle of San Pasqual", "response": ["The battle is unique, as it was one of the few military battles in the United States that involved elements of the Army, Navy, Marines, and civilian volunteers, all in the same skirmish. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians debated which force won or lost the battle. Clearly, Kearny retained the battle area, the ability to operate and maneuver, and also the initiative, though his losses were significantly higher; however, he did not implement his battle plan, his ammunition was compromised, and he outran his artillery and supply line.

An intensely ambitious man, he was constantly writing letters to friends, relatives and anyone who might be able to help him achieve promotion, saying that he desperately needed one and asking them to \"pull some strings\" to help him. Townshend's biographer, the British historian A. J. Barker noted, \"Anybody who could further his career was invariably called up to help, often in the most pleading of terms\". Sean McKnight, the Deputy Head of War Studies at Sandhurst, called him \"just about the most dramatically ambitious senior officer I think I've ever come across. He's never content, he's always looking for the second or third job down the line, and one of the most irritating facets of him is, even when he's got something he should be very happy with, he's not content\". Townshend's endlessly ambitious streak, together with his tendency to view whatever position he held as insufficient for him, and a penchant for writing letters attacking whomever was his commanding officer as incompetent to their commanding officer, made him very unpopular with other officers, who viewed him variously as a treacherous intriguer forever scheming for promotion, a pathetic whiner who was never happy with what he had, and a dangerous megalomaniac whose vainglorious quest for yet another promotion led him to take gratuitous risks.Perry, James Arrogant Armies, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, page 246. The British historian Geoffrey Regan described him as an officer whose high intelligence and abilities were marred by his egomania.Regan, Geoffrey Great Military Blunders, Oxford: PastTimes, 2000, page 98.", "In late 1914, by occupying the Ottoman vilayet (province) of Basra (now in southern Iraq), the British had achieved their strategic purpose of preventing the Ottomans from launching any offensive into the Khuzestan Province where all of the British-owned Persian oil fields were located.Galbraith, John \"No Man's Child: The Campaign in Mesopotamia, 1914\u20131916\" pages 358\u2013385 from The International History Review, Volume 6, Issue # 3, August 984 page 371. There was hence no real strategic need for the British to advance up the Tigris to take Baghdad, but both Nixon and Townshend were all for it for reasons of prestige. Townshend, especially, hoped that such a glorious achievement would lead to his being removed from the backwater of Mesopotamia and given command of a corps on the Western Front.Regan, Geoffrey Great Military Blunders, Oxford: PastTimes, 2000 pages 97\u201398. Historian Geoffrey Regan notes that \"mythical\" Western conceptions made the city attractive as a target.Regan, Geoffrey Great Military Blunders, Oxford: PastTimes, 2000, page 96 Contemporary \"Orientalist\" literature, most notably One Thousand and One Nights, depicted Baghdad as a center of exoticism and romance, building on folk memories of its term as capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Baghdad of Townshend's time was actually a run-down, impoverished provincial city in the Ottoman Empire.Regan, Geoffrey Great Military Blunders, Oxford: PastTimes, 2000, page 96."]}, {"page": "Fight or Flight", "response": ["* Fight or Flight, a 1996 book documenting battles from the soldier's perspective by military historian Geoffrey Regan"]}]}}
