He moved to London in 1932 and joined the Morning Post, transferring to The Observer in 1937. He served as drama critic on the paper for more than 60 years.

Paul Scofield (1956) was an illustrated study of the actor's work, as was John Neville (1961) of his work.\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1981 for services to theatre.He married Wendy Monk (1915\u20132000), also a critic, in 1938. The couple had two sons, Mark Antony Trewin and Ion Trewin (who eventually became the administrator of the Man Booker Prize from 2006).\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the John And Wendy Trewin Award For Best Shakespearian Performance was given by The Critics' Circle in memory of Trewin and his wife.
