After four months in charge Reeves knew he had a lot of work to do as Stoke finished next to bottom of the First Division in 1891\u201392. But after a lot of hard work and a lot of effort on Reeves' part, the players responded and at the end of the next campaign Stoke claimed a welcome mid-table position. Reeves' gambled blending local born stars like Bill Rowley, Tommy Clare and Alf Underwood with Scottish imports Davy Brodie, Davy Christie and Billy Dickson a combination that initially worked well. After an 11th-place finish in 1893\u201394 Stoke had a tough 1894\u201395 season which saw them enter the end of season test match to remain in the top-flight, they beat Newton Heath 3\u20130 to see them safe.

Stoke failed to gain re-election and the end of the season and their place was taken by Sunderland. Stoke joined the Football Alliance for the 1890\u201391 season. A 7\u20131 victory over Accrington where Bob Ramsay scored the \"Potters\" first hat-trick was a rare highlight in what was an awful season. At the end of the season manager Harry Lockett left the club to concentrate on his job as secretary of the Football League and Joseph Bradshaw took over."]}]}}
