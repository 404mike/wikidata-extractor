He added to his medal collection with another Scottish Cup in 1892  alongside former Renton teammate Neil McCallum, becoming the first players to win the competition with two different clubs. Kelly also won the Scottish Football League title in 1892\u201393, 1893\u201394 and 1895\u201396 (and reached three other cup finals, albeit losing them all), playing a major role in the establishment of Celtic as one of the leading clubs in the country.He was capped nine times by Scotland and scored twice. He also appeared seven times for the Scottish League XI. After retiring as a player, Kelly became a director of Celtic, serving as chairman between 1909 and 1914.His descendants Bob Kelly, Michael Kelly and Kevin Kelly also became Celtic directors; a son, Frank also briefly played for the club prior to his death in World War I, and in 1934 another Celtic player Willie Hughes married James Kelly's daughter Bridie, two years after he died.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["Celtic were formed in 1887, and in 1897 the club became a Private Limited Company with a nominal share capital of 5000 shares at \u00a31 each. The following year a further share issue of 5000 \u00a31 shares was created to raise more capital. The largest number of shares held were by businessmen from the East End of Glasgow, notably James Grant, an Irish publican and engineer, James Kelly, one of the club's original players turned publican, and John Glass, a builder and driving force in the early years of the club. His shares, upon his death in 1906, passed on to Thomas White. The Grant, Kelly and White families' shareholdings dominated ownership of the club throughout the 20th century.", "The late 1940s saw Robert Kelly, son of James Kelly, become chairman of the club after having been a director since 1931. Desmond White also joined the board around this time, upon the death of his father Thomas White. By the 1950s, a significant number of shares in the club had passed to Neil and Felicia Grant, who lived in Toomebridge, County Antrim. These shares accounted for more than a sixth of the club's total issue. Club chairman Robert Kelly's own family share-holding was of a similar size, and he used his close relationship with the Toomebridge Grants to ensure his power base at Celtic was unchallengeable. When Neil Grant died in the early 1960s, his shareholding passed to his sister Felicia, leaving her as the largest share-holder in Celtic. This gave rise to the myth among Celtic supporters of the \"old lady in Ireland\" who supposedly had the ultimate say in the running of the club.", "| James Kelly || 1888\u20131897"]}, {"page": "James Kelly", "response": ["* James Kelly (pirate) (died 1701), English pirate", "* James Kelly (crimper), 19th-century American criminal", "* James Kelly (Irish Army officer) (1929\u20132003), cleared of attempting to import arms for the IRA in 1970", "* James Kelly (murderer) (1860\u20131929), English murderer and Jack the Ripper suspect", "* James Kelly (abstract expressionist artist) (1913\u20132003), American painter", "* James Kelly, member of Irish metal group Altar of Plagues", "* James Kelly (fiddler), Irish fiddler, member of folk group Patrick Street", "*James Kelly (U.S. representative) (1760\u20131819), for the Federalist Party, Pennsylvania, 1805\u20131809", "*James Kelly (Fianna F\u00e1il politician), Irish Fianna F\u00e1il politician", "*James Kelly (Repeal Association politician) (1808\u20131875), Irish Repeal Association politician", "*James Kelly (Scottish politician) (born 1963), member of the Scottish Parliament", "*James Kelly, MP for the Irish constituency of Limerick City, 1844\u20131847", "*James Kelly (Australian explorer) (1791\u20131859),", "*James Kelly (footballer, born 1865) (1865\u20131932), Scottish football player (Renton FC, Celtic FC, national team) and administrator", "*James Kelly (Lincoln City footballer) (fl. 1892\u201393), Scottish footballer (Lincoln City FC)", "*James Kelly (soccer) (c. 1920s), U.S. soccer player", "*James Kelly (Australian footballer) (born 1983), Australian rules footballer", "*James Kelly (basketball) (born 1993), American basketball player", "* James Kelly (Australian explorer) (1791\u20131859), Australian mariner and explorer", "* James Kelly (journalist) (1809\u20131895), founder of Chicago Tribune", "* James Kelly (bishop) (1832\u20131907), Anglican bishop of Newfoundland and Scotland", "* James Kelly (priest) (1877\u20131939), New Zealand Catholic priest and editor", "* James Kelly (historian) (born 1959), professor of Irish history"]}, {"page": "Renton, West Dunbartonshire", "response": ["MP and Lord Provost Duncan McLaren was born in Renton, as was MP in, and speaker of, the Canadian House of Commons, James Allison Glen and author Jane Duncan.
