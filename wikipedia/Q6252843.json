And the laugh track, (Si) was right. It was necessary, as much as we were always looking to have a real laugh track, a real audience. In comedies, if you don't have them (laugh track), you're in big trouble, because if you don't hear a laugh track, it's not funny.

She added, however, that it does help in creating \"the atmosphere for the reaction.\" Philpott added that, unlike their UK counterparts, US viewing audiences at the time had become accustomed to hearing laughter, saying, \"I think you find yourself genuinely laughing more if you are prompted to laugh along with the canned laughter.\"", "* Courage (John Philpott) \u2013 a ladybug who plays the drums and sings backup vocals.", "The complete Bugaloos series was released on DVD in May 2006 by Rhino Entertainment.
