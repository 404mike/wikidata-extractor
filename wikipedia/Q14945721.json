Immediately after the unconditional surrender was made, the Japanese authority had to continue to maintain the order of Hong Kong as the Allies were still on the way to take over. However, all the prohibitions and regulations set by the Japanese were entirely lifted and abolished instantly. On the other hand, on the eve of the surrender of Japan, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Horace Seymour, had already tried to make contact with Gimson from Chongqing, urging him to exercise the sovereignty on behalf of the British government. Although Seymour's order arrived late on 23 August, Gimson had declared himself \"acting governor\" and had started to prepare for a \"provisional government\" on 16 August after knowing Japanese had surrendered. Receiving Seymour's order on 23 August, Gimson and other internees left the camp and took over the authority from Japan. Gimson was sworn as acting governor by Chief Justice Atholl MacGregor.  He and other former colonial officials set up the headquarters of the provisional government in the Former French Mission Building. On 27 August, Gimson made a further announcement through radio, stating the provisional government had been established. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the provisional rule, the government had to rely on the Japanese troops to maintain the order of Hong Kong since the power of the administration was limited."]}, {"page": "Atholl (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Atholl MacGregor (1883\u20131945), Scottish lawyer and judge"]}, {"page": "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong", "response": ["|Sir Atholl MacGregor||1934\u20131945"]}, {"page": "Stanley Internment Camp", "response": ["*Sir Atholl MacGregor \u2013 Chief Justice of Hong Kong"]}, {"page": "Fujiya Hotel", "response": ["Allan Mossop and Atholl MacGregor in Japan 1935.jpg|Atholl MacGregor, Chief Justice of Hong Kong and Allan Mossop, Judge of the British Supreme Court for China, at the Fujiya Hotel in 1935"]}, {"page": "List of people buried at sea", "response": ["* Atholl MacGregor (1883\u20131945), Chief Justice of Hong Kong, buried in the Indian Ocean after dying aboard British hospital ship after Japanese internment"]}, {"page": "Attorney General of Kenya", "response": ["* Sir Alisdair Duncan Atholl MacGregor (1929\u20131934)"]}, {"page": "1945 in Scotland", "response": ["* 30 October \u2013 Atholl MacGregor, colonial judge (born 1883)"]}, {"page": "Henry Blackall", "response": ["At the end of World War II, in 1946, he was appointed Chief Justice of Hong Kong replacing Sir Atholl MacGregor.
