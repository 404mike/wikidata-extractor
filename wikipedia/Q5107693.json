They played original compositions and traditional music in a Celtic/British folk style, with influences from reggae, country, pop, jazz and world music. Successive regroupings of the band released nine albums over seventeen years, touring in United Kingdom, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, before finally disbanding in 2001.", "On returning to the UK, Chris Parkinson and Ged Foley formed a new group with John Skelton and Brian Brooks, later billing themselves as The New House Band. In 1987, they recorded a second album, Pacific, for Topic Records.", "During this period, the band also toured in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, with a stay in Zanzibar for a few days. The name for the band's next album, Stonetown, was inspired by the name of the old part of Zanzibar City, the capital of the island of Zanzibar. Immediately after a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, the whole album was recorded in eight days in 1991, for Harbourtown Records. The photo for the sleeve of Stonetown was taken in Whitby, where Chris Parkinson was living at the time and is, coincidentally, the same street where Simply Red had filmed part of the video for their song \"Holding Back the Years\". The album won a Music Retailers Association Annual Award for Excellence (in the 'Folk and Country Music' category) in 1992."]}, {"page": "Chris parkinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Parkinson "]}, {"page": "Christopher Parkinson", "response": ["* Chris Parkinson"]}, {"page": "Pete Morton", "response": ["In 2015, again with Fellside, Morton produced The Land of Time.
