Although he served in several celebrated naval actions of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars his most important achievements were made while serving as a Lord of the Admiralty, pioneering the science and instruction of rapid and accurate gunnery in the Royal Navy through training facilities and manuals.\nIn addition to his work at the Admiralty, Pechell served in the House of Commons for two constituencies and was on good terms with King William IV, who supported his efforts to improve standards of gunnery and returned him to the Admiralty in 1839 after a five-year absence caused by his support for the Whig government. In 1826 he inherited the Pechell Baronetcy from his father, but died childless and the title passed to his brother George.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Controller of the Navy (Royal Navy)", "response": ["* Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Pechell 1832\u20131834", "* Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Pechell 1841"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Sir Samuel Pechell, Third Naval Lord"]}, {"page": "Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Sir Samuel Pechell, Bt"]}, {"page": "Fourth Sea Lord", "response": ["*Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Pechell 1839-1841"]}, {"page": "Arthur Bingham", "response": ["By November 1810 Bingham was given the command of the 20-gun sixth-rate sloop Little Belt, and sailed to Halifax, and later to the Caribbean.

In the ensuing engagement, the British ships outnumbered and overwhelmed their opponent, capturing the ship and her cargo, despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage. The British ships were drawn from a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique, which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks.", "With Cayenne under British control, Topaze made all speed for Guadeloupe, Lahalle intending to land his food supplies and reinforcements on French held territory before attempting the return journey to Europe. For nine days Topaze crossed the Caribbean without encountering any British warships, but at 07:00 on 22 January she was spotted approaching Guadeloupe from the southwest by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron, which was part of a squadron detached from Cochrane's invasion fleet on Barbados to watch the French islands. Although his lookouts had also sighted a French schooner close inshore, Cameron gave orders for his brig to close with the much larger French frigate instead. Within two hours, Hazard was joined by the frigates HMS Cleopatra under Captain Samuel Pechell and HMS Jason under Captain William Maude. Although both ships were smaller than Topaze, together they held a considerable advantage over the overladen French ship.Gardiner, p. 78"]}, {"page": "Sir Samuel John Brooke Pechell, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Sir Samuel Pechell, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Samuel John Pechel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Samuel John Brooke Pechell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Sir Samuel John Brooke-Pechell, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Sir Samuel Brooke-Pechell, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Samuel John Pechell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Samuel Brooke-Pechell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "Samuel John Broke Pechell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Pechell"]}, {"page": "HMS Cleopatra (1779)", "response": ["From August 1808, Cleopatra was under Captain Samuel Pechell.
