She was born in Silloth, Cumberland, England, the daughter of a local physician and one of three sisters who excelled at the game of golf.

A self-taught golfer, she won four British Ladies amateurs between 1914 and 1926. In total she won 12 national titles, 5 French Amateur Ladies and one Canadian Women's Amateur before retiring in 1927. During her playing career, she was one of the leading ladies in the sport and transformed the way that the game was played by women."]}, {"page": "Leitch", "response": ["*Cecil Leitch, English golfer"]}, {"page": "The Womens Amateur Championship", "response": ["The first tournament was played at the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, England and was won by Lady Margaret Scott, who also won the following two years; her feat of three straight titles remains the record, matched by Cecil Leitch and Enid Wilson. In 1927, Simone de la Chaume of France, who had won the 1924 British Girls Amateur Golf Championship, became the first golfer from outside the British Isles to win the Ladies Championship. The first competitor from the United States to win the title was Babe Zaharias in 1947.", "In 1913 the final at Lytham & St Annes was extended to 36-holes. The final was played on a Friday with the quarter and semi-finals played on the previous day. Canadian Violet Pooley was one of the semi-finalists. Muriel Dodd beat Evelyn Chubb in the final. Dodd won five holes in a row from the 4th to the 8th holes of the morning round and eventually won 8&6. Dodd was beaten in the semi-finals of the 1914 championship at Hunstanton. The final was between Cecil Leitch and Gladys Ravenscroft. Ravenscroft had beaten Leitch in the semi-finals in 1912, but on this occasion Leitch won a close match 2&1, the morning round having finished all-square.", "A championship was planned for October 1919 at Burnham & Berrow but was cancelled because of a railway strike. The first post World War I championship was played at Royal County Down in May 1920. Cecil Leitch, the defending champion from 1914, met Molly Griffiths in the final. Leitch was 6 holes up after the morning round and won 7&6. Joyce Wethered made her first appearance at Turnberry in 1921 and she and Leitch would dominate the event in the 1920s, the two meeting in the final in 1921, 1922 and 1925. They had met in the final of the 1920 English Women's Amateur Championship, with Wethered winning, but in the 1921 Womens Amateur Championship, the result was reversed. Leitch was 8 up with 9 holes to play and, although Wethered then won four holes in a row, Leitch won the match 4&3. When the pair met again in 1922 at Royal St George's, the morning round was close, with Wethered a hole ahead. However she then dominated in the afternoon, eventually winning 9&7. In 1923 Leitch was injured and Wethered was surprisingly beaten in the semi-finals, leaving a final between Doris Chambers and Muriel Macbeth. In the final Macbeth was 3 up after the morning round but Chambers won the match at the 36th hole. In 1924, at Royal Portrush, Wethered and Leitch met in quarter-finals. Wethered won 6&4 and went on to win her second title. At Troon in 1925, Wethered and Leitch met in the final for the third time. The match was level after 18 holes and still level after 27. Wethered then took a two-hole lead before Leitch won the last holes to level the match. The match ended at the 37th hole with Wethered winning her third championship.", "The 1926 championship was due to be played in Harlech in May but was postponed because of the general strike. The event as rearranged to June, although the Women's Home Internationals, that generally preceded the championship, were cancelled. Joyce Wethered did not enter and Cecil Leitch won, the first woman to win the event four times. A large number of the original entrants scratched and the final was played a day earlier than usual, on a Thursday. Simone de la Chaume won the championship in 1927, the first French woman to do so. She had been a semi-finalist in 1926 and was also the first French winner of the Girls Amateur Championship, in 1924. There was another French winner in 1928 when Manette le Blan won the title. The 1929 championship was played on the Old Course at St Andrews. Wethered came out of retirement to play and met the American, Glenna Collett, in the final. Collett had already won the U.S. Women's Amateur three times. The final created great public interest. After 9 holes Collett led by 5 but her lead was reduced to 2 after the morning round. Wethered then won 7 of the first 9 holes in the afternoon to be 4 up and eventually won 3&1, her fourth win in the championship. Collett reached the final again at Formby in 1930 and met Diana Fishwick in the final. Fishwick was competing in the event for the first time although she had won the Girls Amateur Championship in 1927 and 1928. Fishwick led by 5 after the first round and eventually won 4&3.", "|1926 || Royal St David's ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|8 & 7 ||  Marjorie Ross Garon ||  Simone de la Chaume,  Winifred McNair || ", "|1925 || Troon ||  Joyce Wethered ||align=\"center\"|37 holes ||  Cecil Leitch ||  Beryl Brown,  Gladys Dobell || ", "|1922 || Royal St George's ||  Joyce Wethered ||align=\"center\"|9 & 7 ||  Cecil Leitch ||  Gladys Bastin,  Joan Stocker || ", "|1921 || Turnberry ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|4 & 3 ||  Joyce Wethered ||  Janet Jackson,  Lena Scroggie || ", "|1920 || Royal County Down ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|7 & 6 ||  Molly Griffiths ||  Doris Fraser,  Janet Jackson || ", "|1914 || Hunstanton ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|2 & 1 ||  Gladys Ravenscroft ||  Muriel Dodd,  Elsie Grant Suttie || ", "|1912 || Turnberry ||  Gladys Ravenscroft ||align=\"center\"|3 & 2 ||  Stella Temple ||  Gladys Heming-Johnson,  Cecil Leitch || ", "|1908 || St Andrews Links ||  Maud Titterton ||align=\"center\"|19 holes ||  Dorothy Campbell ||  Cecil Leitch,  Hilda Mather || ", "* 4 wins: Cecil Leitch, Joyce Wethered"]}, {"page": "Royal County Down Golf Club", "response": ["*British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship: 1899 (winner: May Hezlet), 1907 (winner: May Hezlet), 1920 (winner: Cecil Leitch), 1927 (winner: Simone de la Chaume), 1935 (winner: Wanda Morgan), 1950 (winner: Vicomtesse de St Sauveur), 1963 (winner: Brigitte Varangot) and 2006 (winner: Bel\u00e9n Mozo)."]}, {"page": "List of female golfers", "response": ["| Cecil Leitch||1891\u20131977"]}, {"page": "Canadian Women's Amateur", "response": ["*1921 Cecil Leitch"]}, {"page": "Hunstanton Golf Club", "response": ["| 1 || 1914||Cecil Leitch||||align=\"center\"|2 & 1|| Gladys Ravenscroft"]}, {"page": "Thomas Renouf", "response": ["By the age of 17, and barely speaking any English, he had turned professional and traveled to the north of England taking a job at the Roundhay Golf Club in Leeds.
