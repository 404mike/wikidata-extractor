In November 1943, the regiment became the Armoured Reconnaissance regiment of the 7th Armoured Division. On 9 June 1944, they were aboard a convoy leaving Bumper Quay in Gosport at 11am, bound for the Normandy beaches. Having been delayed several days by bad weather, they landed at Le Hamel on Gold Beach and leaguered up at Sommervieu near Bayeux. Going into action almost immediately they began taking casualties at Granville Crossroads, Livry in the fighting around Villers-Bocage. From 11\u201330 June, the 8th were involved in the advance through the Bocage with the 22nd Armoured Brigade. They were involved in action against the 2nd Panzer Division, with the 8th leading their division out of the bridgehead. On 30 June, they handed over their positions to tanks from the US 2nd Armored Division and withdrew for a rest and a refit of the tanks. They also fought heavily around Briquessard and took a full part in Operation Goodwood and a number of other smaller engagements. The 8th pushed German forces further and further back, taking part in the actions to close the Falaise pocket suffering more casualties of men and tanks. Reinforced by a squadron from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, they pushed back through France, the break-out into the low countries, crossing the border into Belgium on 11 September 1944 and into the Netherlands on 23 September, taking up positions at Sint Oedenrode and finally to the Rhine, fighting hard on the way at St Pol, the Nederrijn and the Maas. After wintering in the Maas and spending some time employed as infantry in support of the Rifle Brigade during the latter half of 1944, the regiment painted its vehicles white (including the recently acquired Sherman Firefly versions with their effective 17 pdr guns and the Chaffee recce tanks) and prepared to support the counterattack against the German offensive in the Ardennes. In the event, this did not occur and the Irish Hussars continued their advance across the Netherlands dealing with resistance when they came across it. Colonel Gouldburn moved on at this juncture and was replaced by Lt Col Desmond Fitzpatrick of the Royal Dragoons with Major Wingate Charlton DSC (formerly with \"Glubb\" Pasha in the Arab Legion)as second in command. In April 1945, the 8th crossed Weser River liberating the POW camp at FallingbostelFallingbostel Military Museum before ending the war close to Hamburg. The regiment then went to Berlin on 7 July 1945 to take part in the Victory celebrations \u2013 the 2nd senior British Army regiment on parade. The regiment stayed in Itzehoe, Germany, for a year, before moving to the Dutch border to help with internal security and occupation duties."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Richard Desmond Fitzpatrick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Desmond Fitzpatrick"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir Desmond Fitzpatrick"]}, {"page": "1971 New Year Honours", "response": ["* General Sir Desmond Fitzpatrick, , (53670) late Royal Armoured Corps, Deputy Colonel The Blues and Royals."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Desmond Fitzpatrick, general, was born in Aldershot"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2002", "response": ["*Sir Desmond Fitzpatrick, 89, British general."]}, {"page": "List of governors of dependent territories in the 20th century", "response": ["::*Desmond Fitzpatrick, Lieutenant governor (1974\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "Vice Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir Desmond Fitzpatrick 1966\u20131968"]}]}}
