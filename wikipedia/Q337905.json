His father and his two surviving brothers were all Members of Parliament (MPs): his eldest brother Spencer, MP for North Lancashire 1857\u201391 and later 8th Duke of Devonshire, led the Liberal Party and was asked three times to be Prime Minister by Queen Victoria; the middle brother, Frederick was MP for the West Riding and Chief Secretary for Ireland and was assassinated in 1882.\nCavendish was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade. On retirement from the regular army he joined the 2nd Derbyshire Militia (later the Sherwood Foresters), but transferred to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in 1888.\nCavendish served as MP for West Derbyshire from the creation of the constituency until his death. Like his eldest brother, he became a Liberal Unionist in reaction to the Liberal Party's policy on Irish Home Rule.
