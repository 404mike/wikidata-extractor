On 11 May Deputy Assistant Commissary John Buckley, Lieutenants Forrest, Willoughby and Raynor, Conductors Shaw and Scully, plus 3 others of the Bengal Ordnance Department defended Magazine for more than five hours against thousands of rebels. After the mutineers had stormed the Palace, the gates of the Magazine were closed and barricaded. Inside the gates were placed 6 pounder Cannon, double charged with grape. For the further defence of the Gate and the Magazine, there was a 24 pounder Howitzer, which could be aimed at any part of the Magazine, which was operated by Buckley. The native Garrison was then armed, but it was clear that they too were on the verge of mutiny as the men refused to obey any orders issued by Europeans."]}]}}
