Instead of the last \"\", the word \"\" is extended to the only melisma of the otherwise austere, strictly syllabic composition. The author of the program notes for an Oratorio Society of New York CD that includes the motet writes that the melisma \"spins an ethereal spell\". It leads to a long general pause, achieved \"by carefully measuring out five beats\", before \"\" is repeated a final time, concluding \"peacefully and serenely\". The author of the Oratorio Society notes concludes by stating that \" is a hauntingly beautiful work reminiscent of the quiet chapel it honored\". Writing for Gramophone, Malcolm Riley called it \"sublime (and deceptively difficult)\"."]}]}}
