In 1982 they lost at the semi-final stage to the Oklahoma City Slickers. He then hired Bobby Moore as a coach. At the end of a disappointing 1983 campaign the league folded and Marsh returned to the Tampa Bay Rowdies as head coach in October 1983. There he gave Roy Wegerle his debut as a professional player. After the 1984 season the North American Soccer League also disbanded. The club remained however, and later joined the National Professional Soccer League.

Fifteen league games without a win followed, keeping the club rooted at the foot of the table. The Sentinel's Chris Harper commented that \"Vale cannot go on being applauded off the park as entertaining losers.\" Phil Sproson noted that the ongoing contract problems caused unrest in the camp. Siddall handed in his notice, whilst Bob Newton and \u00a38,000 were traded to Chesterfield for the services of Martin Henderson. Bromage walked out on the club after they refused to give him a contract lasting beyond two years. On 31 October, McGrath had to use 41-year-old coach Alan Oakes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle. Chairman Jim Lloyd then blocked McGrath's attempt to sign defender Ken Fogarty, showing how little confidence the board had in their manager. McGrath complained in the media, only to be 'gagged', instructed only to speak to the media on team affairs. Supporters began organizing demonstrations against Lloyd, and in favour of McGrath. In November Siddall and Bromage returned to sign new contracts. Steve Fox was suspended by the club for a fortnight after he refused to play in defence, and on 26 November Burnley thrashed Vale 7\u20130 at Turf Moor in front of Granada TV cameras. Starting December nine points adrift of safety, paying the third-highest wage bill in the division (\u00a39,000 a week), and home gate receipts down to around \u00a33,000, McGrath was suspended on full pay. The club received a flood of letters in protest, 'some just abusive', but McGrath left permanently after being compensated financially."]}, {"page": "Soccer Bowl '80", "response": ["|DF ||7 || Ken Fogarty"]}, {"page": "1983 Fort Lauderdale Strikers indoor season", "response": ["The bad luck continued.
