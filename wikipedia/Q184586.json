Bale moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2007, for an eventual \u00a37 million fee. During his time at Tottenham, managerial and tactical shifts saw him transform into a more attacking player. From the 2009\u201310 season, under the guidance of Harry Redknapp, Bale became an integral part of the team, rising to international attention during the 2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League. In 2011 and 2013 he was named PFA Players' Player of the Year, and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year. In 2013, he was also named PFA Young Player of the Year, the FWA Footballer of the Year and the Premier League Player of the Season. He was nominated to the PFA Team of the Year three times in a row between 2011 and 2013.\nOn 1 September 2013, Bale was transferred to Real Madrid for an undisclosed fee. Press at the time reported the transfer value at figures between \u20ac91 million and \u20ac100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to the transfer were leaked which confirmed a then-world record transfer fee of \u20ac100.8 million, exceeding the previous record fee of \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million) the club paid for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. Bale played an integral role in his first season at Real Madrid, helping the club to win the 2013\u201314 Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League, scoring in both finals. The following season, he won the UEFA Super Cup and scored in a third major final to help the club win the FIFA Club World Cup. Two years later, he was a key player in another Champions League run, winning the 2015\u201316 title and being elected to the UEFA Squad of the Season. He was also a finalist in the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, and was named man of the match having scored with an overhead kick in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final.\nBale made his senior international debut for Wales in May 2006, becoming the youngest player at that point to represent Wales. He has since earned over 90 caps and scored 36 international goals, making him Wales' highest scorer of all time. He was the top scorer for Wales in their successful qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring seven goals; he subsequently represented Wales in the final tournament as they reached the semi-finals, scoring three goals. He also subsequently featured for the side at UEFA Euro 2020. He has been named Welsh Footballer of the Year a record six times.
