Their regular players present were the three Grace brothers, their cousin Walter Gilbert, wicket-keeper James Bush and batsmen James Cranston and Thomas Matthews. They also had the inexperienced William Woof, Carleton Haynes and Edward Wright, all of whom made their first-class debuts against Surrey. That was ten, so another player had to be found and Grace decided to take action.", "The Australian Billy Midwinter had played for Gloucestershire in 1877 and, as luck or the fixture list would have it, he was at Lord's on 20 June to represent the Australians against Middlesex. Midwinter was at net practice when he saw W. G. and E. M. Grace, accompanied by James Bush, approaching. They argued that he was under contractual obligation to play for Gloucestershire if required and Grace demanded that he accompany them to The Oval at once. One source says that Midwinter was still under a contractual obligation to Gloucestershire and that the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked.Bowen, p. 130. Midwinter's reaction to Grace's demand is unknown but Tom Horan later wrote that Midwinter \"did not seem to know his own mind for two minutes together\".Rae, p. 224. Whether he was in agreement or not, Midwinter did go to The Oval with the Graces. They were pursued by Conway, Gregory and Boyle who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders.Harte, pp. 100\u2013101 In another account, the incident is dismissed as \"an amusing little quarrel\". The argument was serious enough and was fuelled by a long-standing \"antagonism\" between Grace and Conway which dated back to Grace's 1873 visit to Australia.Allen, p. 19. At one point, Grace called the Australians \"a damned lot of sneaks\", though he later apologised in a letter to Gregory.Rae, p. 225. In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire for the rest of the season, although he did not play for the county against the Australians in September, due to a hand injury.Birley, pp. 111\u2013112."]}, {"page": "W. G. Grace's cricket career (1864 to 1870)", "response": ["It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club.Birley, p.104. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 & 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers E.M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874.Webber, County Championship, pp.14\u201320. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6\u201386 and 6\u201320. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire."]}, {"page": "W. G.

They twice defeated Surrey by an innings margin but had less success against Nottinghamshire, drawing with them at Clifton College Close Ground and then losing by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. The team had certain regulars but tended to include occasional and even guest players, some of whom weakened the side, whereas Nottinghamshire generally turned out a full-strength eleven. The key Gloucestershire players were the three Graces, batsman Thomas Matthews, wicket-keeper James Bush (who was also an England rugby union international), slow left-armer Robert Miles and all-rounders George Strachan and Frank Townsend. Newcomers in 1871 were Frederic Carter and George Wyatt who both made a number of appearances over the next few seasons."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* James Bush (1870\u20131890) : J.
