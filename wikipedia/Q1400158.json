He produced cabinet photographs of many famous Victorian statesmen, artists, and members of the aristocracy, many of which were published in his two-volume work, Men and Women of the Day, 1888-89. Most of Barraud's images were Woodburytypes, then a newly developed process which lent itself admirably to portraiture, being able to render middle tones accurately.\nBetween 1873 and 1880 he had a partnership, Barraud & Jerrard, with George Milner Gibson Jerrard (1848\u20131918).Barraud's studios were at 96 Gloucester Place, Portman Square in 1883, at 263 Oxford Street (\"A few doors west of 'The Circus'\") between 1883 and 1891, at 73 Piccadilly from 1893 to 1896, and at 126 Piccadilly in 1897. Another studio was located at 92 Bold Street, Liverpool.\nHerbert's brother was Francis James Barraud (1856\u20131924), an artist celebrated for having created \"His Master's Voice\", a painting used in advertising by the early HMV gramophone records. His father was the painter Henry Barraud; his son Cyril Henry Barraud was also an artist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portraits of Charles Darwin", "response": ["| Herbert Rose Barraud (1845\u20131896)", "| Photograph by Herbert Rose Barraud, thought by Darwin photograph scholar Gene Kritsky to be the last photograph taken of Darwin before his death in 1882.
