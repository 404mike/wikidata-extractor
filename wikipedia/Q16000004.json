He also played for Cambridge University in 1947, winning a blue by playing in the annual Varsity cricket match against Oxford. In his working life, he was a schoolmaster, and most of his first-class cricket was played in school holiday times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Somerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims. Other players were Bill Andrews in his final season, Frank Lee in his final season before becoming an umpire, Hugh Watts, George Woodhouse, Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Miles Coope.Playfair, pp. 104\u2013105."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Hugh Watts (1939\u20131952) 61 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Derek Henderson", "response": ["After graduating from Trinity College, Henderson began a career in teaching.

It was initially an all-boys boarding prep school modeled after the likes of Ludgrove School. Pupils often move on to other nearby public schools and independent Catholic schools such as Shrewsbury School, Malvern College, Moreton Hall School and Downside School.Leavers' destinations", "From then, Moor Park's tenants were mostly schools. During World War II, Lancing College evacuated to Moor Park from West Sussex to escape impending air raids. One notable Old Lancing from this era is novelist Tom Sharpe. His novel Blott on the Landscape was loosely based on Moor Park and the Foster family. After Lancing College returned to its original site, St Margaret's School was founded at Moor Park by Miss Nugent-Thorpe of the Parents' National Education Union (PNEU), and continued until her retirement in 1962. In 1964 the estate was bought by Hugh Watts and Derek Henderson and became the present-day school.History"]}, {"page": "Hugh Watt (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Hugh Watts (1922\u20131993), English cricketer"]}]}}
