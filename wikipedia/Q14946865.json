He is a professor of History at Queen Mary, University of London, he is one of the leading authorities on twentieth-century France.\nHe was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he obtained his doctorate in 1982 and had been supervised by Professor Christopher Andrew. After many years spent at the University of Wales, Swansea, he joined the Queen Mary History Department in 2003.\nJackson\u2019s first two books were notable contributions about the 1930s crisis in France. The Politics of Depression France 1932\u20131936 (Cambridge University Press, 1985) was a study of economic policy-making in France during the Depression and more generally of the Depression's impact on French politics. The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934\u20131938 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), a history of the Popular Front, encompassed its political, social and cultural dimensions.\nIn more recent years, Jackson\u2019s research interests have moved on to the period after 1940. In 2001, he published an extensive synthesis of France under the Occupation entitled France: The Dark Years 1940\u20131944 (Oxford University Press: 2001), which was short-listed for the Los Angeles Times History Book Prize and translated into French in 2003. The French translation was commended by the judges of the Prix Philippe Viannay-D\u00e9fense de la France.\nJackson\u2019s most recent books include The Fall of France (2003) and De Gaulle (2018), and he edited The Short Oxford History of Europe 1900\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). The Fall of France was one of the winners of the Wolfson History Prize for 2004. In 2009, Jackson had a study of homosexual politics in France after 1945 published in English by the University of Chicago Press.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Julian T.

On the other hand, if Vichy was the legal French government as some such as Julian T. Jackson have argued, de Gaulle and his followers were revolutionaries, unlike the Dutch, Belgian, and other governments in exile in London. A third option might be that neither considered that a fully free, legitimate, sovereign, and independent successor state to the Third Republic existed following the Armistice, as both Free France and Vichy France refrained from making that implicit claim by studiously avoiding using the word \"republic\" when referring to themselves, even though republicanism had been a core ideological value and central tenet of the French state ever since the French Revolution\u2014and especially since the Franco-Prussian War. In Vichy's case those reasons were compounded with ideas of a  about stamping out France's republican heritage."]}, {"page": "Milice", "response": ["Early Milice volunteers included members of France's pre-war far-right parties (such as the Action Fran\u00e7aise) and working-class men convinced of the benefits of the Vichy government's politics. In addition to ideology, incentives for joining the Milice included employment, regular pay and rations. (The latter became particularly important as the war continued, and civilian rations dwindled to near-starvation levels.) Some joined because members of their families had been killed or injured in Allied bombing raids or had been threatened, extorted or attacked by French Resistance groups. Still others joined for more mundane reasons: petty criminals were recruited by being told their sentences would be commuted if they joined the organization, and Milice volunteers were exempt from transportation to Germany as forced labour.Paul Jankowski, \"In Defense of Fiction: Resistance, Collaboration, and Lacombe, Lucien\". The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 63, No. 3 (Sep., 1991), pp. 462 It is estimated by several historians (including Julian T. Jackson) that the Milice's membership reached 25,000\u201330,000 by 1944, although official figures are difficult to obtain. The majority of members were not full-time militiamen, but devoted only a few hours per week to their Milice activities.Matthew Feldman, 2004, Fascism: The 'fascist epoch', p. 243,  The Milice had a section for full-time members, the Franc-Garde, who were permanently mobilized and lived in barracks."]}, {"page": "Alfred Cortot", "response": ["During World War II, he accepted the position of Haut-Commissaire (\"High Commissioner\") for arts in the Vichy government and served twice (1941 and 1942) as a member of the Vichy's Conseil national (\"National Council\")'Alfred Denis Cortot', The Fryderyk Chopin Institut, accessed 13 January 2018.David Dubal booklet to Nimbus Records release of Duo-Art piano rolls France The Dark Years 1940\u20131944 by Julian T.

However, before this he took a strong stance in defending the French music tradition with the Beaux Arts administration (Fine Arts) supporting soldiers with music. Cortot had to leave this position after P\u00e9tain's appointment and exerted his energy instead into writing reports about cultural propaganda and defending French musical styles. He was charged with musical reform by the P\u00e9tain government, and the Vichy took control of musical activities.
