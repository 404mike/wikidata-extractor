The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times \u2013 potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002\u201303, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced Glentoran as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from Gareth McAuley was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through Jody Tolan. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant."]}, {"page": "Andy Smith (footballer, born 1980)", "response": ["Smith returned to Northern Ireland on a permanent basis when he signed with Glentoran in February 2002, and scored two goals in ten league games in the remainder of the 2001\u201302 campaign. He had a prolific 2002\u201303 season to help Glentoran win a treble (the league title, County Antrim Shield, and Irish League Cup), scoring 35 goals in all competitions, and was described as a \"fans favourite\" due to his \"peroxide blonde\" hair and \"cheeky goal celebrations\". His goal tally included a 12-minute hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win over Institute on New Year's Eve. He played in the League Cup final, a 2\u20130 win over Linfield at Windsor Park. He scored a goal as Glentoran lifted the County Antrim Shield with a 3\u20130 victory over Ballymena United. The \"Glens\" could have won a quadruple, but lost 1\u20130 Coleraine in the final of the Irish Cup after a shot from Jody Tolan deflected off Smith into the net. He was sidelined from The Oval for a month with a knee injury, but managed to score seven goals in 23 league games in the 2003\u201304 campaign. He helped Glentoran to win the Irish Cup in his final appearance for the club, as they beat Coleraine 1\u20130 to avenge their defeat the previous year."]}, {"page": "Jody tolan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jody Tolan "]}]}}
