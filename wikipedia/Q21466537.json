She began painting full-time in 1950, with her earliest works produced from watercolours and later oil. One of her painting was selected by Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, to be hung as a decoration in his study in 10 Downing Street. Reynolds became known for her studying of the arid landscapes of Arizona and New Mexico in 1968 but switched to mezzotint printmaking in middle-age. From 1964 to 1967, she was chair of the Women's International Art Club and was a fellow of the Printmakers Council. A memoir of Reynolds was written and published by her husband Graham Reynolds for close friends of the couple in 2007.", "link_mentions": {}}}
