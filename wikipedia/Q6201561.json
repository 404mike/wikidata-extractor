He made his Football League debut in the opening game of the 1900\u201301 season away to Glossop; he conceded just one goal, but Newton Heath were unable to score themselves and they lost 1\u20130. Garvey kept a clean sheet in Newton Heath's next game, a 4\u20130 home win over Middlesbrough, but was replaced for the next game by Jimmy Whitehouse, newly signed from Grimsby Town. He only made four more appearances before the end of the season, one of these coming as a result of Whitehouse's selection as an emergency forward against Walsall. He spent most of the rest of the season in the club's reserve team; one notable appearance in December 1900 saw him save a penalty as Newton Heath \u2013 whose team consisted of just nine men \u2013 held Glossop to a 1\u20131 draw."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Whitehouse", "response": ["Jimmy Whitehouse may refer to:", "* Jimmy Whitehouse (footballer, born 1873)", "* Jimmy Whitehouse (footballer, born 1924)"]}]}}
