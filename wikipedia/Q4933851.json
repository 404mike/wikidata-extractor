By 1981 Newcastle United were heavily in debt, crowds were at an all-time low and the future looked very bleak. Arthur Cox had been brought in as manager but was having a tough time with the cash-strapped club, which was stuck in the second division under the unpopular chairmanship of Bob Rutherford, who was widely seen as being a puppet for the previous chairman, long-serving director Lord Westwood. Early in that year, the directors came up with a plan whereby they would donate \u00a313,000 each to the club in order to get it out of debt. However, Westwood refused to go along with the plan and resigned from the board. This left Rutherford without any allies, and the remaining board members unanimously demanded that he resign, which he did."]}, {"page": "Robert Rutherford", "response": ["* Bob Rutherford (born 1878), English footballer"]}]}}
