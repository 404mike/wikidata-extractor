After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \"keen and fearless\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3\u20131 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935\u201336 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games."]}, {"page": "Alick Jeffrey", "response": ["The road around the Doncaster Rovers stadium opened in 2006 was named Alick Jeffrey Way, whilst five apartment blocks built on the site of the former Doncaster Rovers ground at Belle Vue were named after five of the Rovers' greatest ever players - Alick Jeffrey, Walter Langton, Tom Keetley, Syd Bycroft and James Coppinger."]}]}}
