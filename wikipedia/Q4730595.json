He moved to Scottish Premier League club St Johnstone in 1998. Ferguson mainly served St Johnstone as backup to Alan Main and made only six league appearances in two seasons with the club.\nHe signed for Airdrie in 2000, and was part of the team when they went bust in 2002. He then played for Falkirk and was part of the side which knocked Hearts out of the Scottish Cup in 2003. That same side won the Scottish First Division the same season but were not accepted by the Scottish Premier League because their ground did not meet SPL standards. Ferguson was part of the side that was promoted to the SPL in 2005.\nAfter one further season with Falkirk, Ferguson moved to Stranraer, where he made eight appearances in two seasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matt Glennon", "response": ["He went to Scotland to join SPL club Falkirk in July 2005 after saying he had been \"bowled over by the quality of the stadium and training facilities\". He featured 23 times in the first half of the 2005\u201306 season before he decided to leave the club after being dropped for Allan Ferguson by manager John Hughes. He moved on to Scottish First Division side St Johnstone in January 2006 after manager Owen Coyle released back-up goalkeeper Mark Paston. At St Johnstone he scored his only senior goal, as a desperate last-minute attempt to equalise paid off in a 2\u20132 draw at Ross County on 11 March. Coyle offered Glennon a contract to stay at McDiarmid Park, but he instead chose to return south of the border to sign with Peter Jackson's Huddersfield Town in June 2006."]}, {"page": "2004 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||1|| Allan Ferguson || ||"]}, {"page": "2001 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||1|| Allan Ferguson"]}, {"page": "1992 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|GK |||| Allan Ferguson"]}]}}
