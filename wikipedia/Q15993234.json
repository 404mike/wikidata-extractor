The company was active between 1983 and 1991, and shut down completely in early 1992.", "In the early 1980s, Jim Mackonochie worked as development manager for British communications company Mirror Group Newspapers. On a trip to the U.S., Mackonochie got a hold of a Commodore PET personal computer, alongside a copy of VisiCalc, a spreadsheet application for the system. This combination led him to believe that Mirror, as a communications company, should be working more closely with computer software, wherefore he approached Mirror's board of directors in 1983, suggesting that they launch a software label under Mirror Group's name, and thereby diversifying the group's non-newspaper operations, which already included Mirror Boats and Mirror Books. The division, named Mirrorsoft, was officially launched in late 1983, and Mackonochie was allowed to task several of his staff from his department at Mirror Group to aid him with establishing the division."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Jim Mackonochie, Royal Navy officer and video game developer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2013", "response": ["*Jim Mackonochie, 52, British Royal Navy officer and video game developer, liver cancer.British Royal Navy officer and video game developer Jim Mackonochie passes away|gamasutra.com"]}, {"page": "JimMack", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Mackonochie"]}]}}
