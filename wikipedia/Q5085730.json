He continued with his juvenile team Glentyan Thistle, playing in the Lord Weir Cup Final at Cathkin Park in June 1956.

Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright, who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce's first spell with the club. However Wright was sacked in December 1985, and his successor, Phil Neal, did not get along with Allardyce. Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce to the bench, despite Neal being a full-back. Bolton reached the 1986 Associate Members' Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, which ended in a 3\u20130 defeat to Bristol City, with Allardyce as an unused substitute."]}, {"page": "Workington A.F.C.", "response": ["* Charlie Wright (GK) (5 full caps)"]}, {"page": "Charles Wright", "response": ["* Charlie Wright (Kent cricketer) (1895\u20131959), English cricketer", "* Charlie Wright (born 1938), Scottish football manager and player"]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Charlie Wright||||GK||1962\u20131965||129||0"]}]}}
