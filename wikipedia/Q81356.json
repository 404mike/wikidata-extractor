He was the manager of EFL League One club Doncaster Rovers for six months before being dismissed in November 2021.\nWellens began his career at Manchester United before signing for Blackpool in 2000, where he went on to win promotion from League Two via the playoffs in 2001. In 2005, he left to join Oldham Athletic, where he made 87 appearances in two seasons at the club, before moving to Doncaster in 2007, becoming an instant fans' favourite by helping get the club promoted to the Championship for the first time in 50 years. After helping the club stay in the division, he moved to Leicester City, and during his time he won the club's Player of the Year in 2011. After a short loan spell with Ipswich Town, Wellens rejoined Doncaster in 2013, where he spent a further three years. Towards the end of his career, he had a short return to Oldham, before playing for Shrewsbury Town, and non-league clubs Salford City and Macclesfield Town, his final club before retiring in 2017.\nWellens' first role in management came when he returned to Oldham as first team manager from September 2017 to June 2018, when he was sacked following the club's relegation to League Two. Wellens then took over the vacant managerial position at Swindon Town in the summer of 2018, eventually leading the club to the 2019\u201320 League Two title on PPG during the COVID-19 pandemic. He left Swindon to manage League Two team Salford City in November 2020, but lasted less than six months in charge before being sacked, having won the rearranged 2019\u201320 EFL Trophy. In May 2021 Wellens became manager of Doncaster.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 26", "response": ["*  1980   \u2013 Richie Wellens, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Swindon Town F.C.", "response": ["* Richie Wellens 2018\u20132020"]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["|2010\u201311|| Richie Wellens"]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers F.C.", "response": ["For the 2021-22 season, former trophy winning Doncaster Rovers player Richie Wellens was installed as first team manager, with Noel Hunt as assistant manager.", "| 2007\u201308 ||  Richie Wellens ||"]}, {"page": "Middleton Cricket Club", "response": ["*     Richie Wellens"]}, {"page": "Paul Scholes", "response": ["On 12 October 2020, Scholes was appointed interim head coach of Salford City, following the departure of Graham Alexander.

He stated that his aim was to help the club reach the Premier League next season. Caldwell helped Burnley keep three consecutive clean sheets between 23 August 2008 and 30 August 2008. It wasn't until on 27 September 2008 when Caldwell scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20131 win against Preston North End. During a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic on 25 October 2008, he suffered a hip injury that saw him substituted in the 51st minute. But Caldwell quickly recovered from the injury and returned to the starting line\u2013up against Reading on 28 October 2008, as the club won 1\u20130. Prior to the match against Chelsea in the Round of 16 of the League Cup, Caldwell said he wanted the opposition team to field in stronger players, saying: \"I really hope they play their best team against us because you want to play against the very best. I'm sure they\u2019ll play a strong team, they seem to have been doing it in other rounds of the cup and you want to play against people like Nicolas Anelka, John Terry and Frank Lampard because they're at the very top of football.\" However in a match, he captained Burnley throughout the match to extra time until his sending off in the 116th minute for a second bookable offence, as the club won 5\u20134 in the penalty shootout following a 1\u20131 draw. After serving a one match suspension, Caldwell returned to the starting line\u2013up against Doncaster Rovers on 22 November 2008 and helped Burnley keep a clean sheet, in a 0\u20130 draw. Once again, he received a straight red card after dragging Richie Wellens back inside the area, in a 2\u20131 loss against Doncaster Rovers on 28 December 2008. After serving a two match suspension, Caldwell returned to the starting line\u2013up against Swansea City on 10 January 2009, as the club lost 2\u20130. It wasn't until on 21 March 2009 when Caldwell scored his second goal of the season, in a 2\u20131 win against Plymouth Argyle. He then helped the club reach the play\u2013offs after beating Bristol City 4\u20130 on the last game of the season. Caldwell then helped Burnley beat Reading 3\u20130 in the semi\u2013finals of the Football League Championship play-off to reach the final. The highlight of Caldwell's Burnley career was lifting the Football League Championship play-off trophy as captain after beating Sheffield United 1\u20130 to play in the Premier League next season. However, he expressed mixed emotions, due to his former club, Newcastle United, being relegated. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, Caldwell made 57 starts throughout the season, as the Scottish international was a virtual ever-present in the Clarets back-line."]}]}}
