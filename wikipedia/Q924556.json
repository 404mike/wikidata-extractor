His publications assisted many botanists and scientists in the decades that followed.  He was the younger brother of theatre and hotel manager Helen Carte.\nBlack was born at Wigtown, Scotland and educated at Wigtown Grammar School, the Edinburgh Academy, the College School, Taunton and a commercial trade school in Dresden, Germany.  He was a linguist, able to understand Arabic, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish.  He migrated to Australia in 1877 and developed an interest in Australian Aboriginal languages. In 1879 Black married Alice Denford and they had a daughter and three sons. He began working as a journalist in 1883.  After a tour of South America and Europe following his mother's death in 1903, Black focused on systematic botany.  In 1909 he published The Naturalised Flora of South Australia.  His The Flora of South Australia was published in four parts during 1922 to 1929, and described 2,430 species, both indigenous and naturalized. It was indispensable to botanists and to those concerned with the vegetation of the arid regions of contiguous States.  He began a revised edition of his book in 1939 and worked steadily for twelve years, publishing part 1 in 1943 and part 2 in 1948.  Part 3 was nearing completion at his death.J.M.Black received the following distinctions for his botanical work:- 1927, Honorary Lecturer in Systematic Botany at the University of Adelaide; 1930, Associate honoris causa of the Linnean Society, London; 1930, Sir Joseph Verco Medal of the Royal Society of South Australia; 1932 Ferdinand von Mueller Medal (Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science); 1933\u201334, President of the Royal Society of South Australia; in 1942, the M.B.E.; 1945, Australian Natural History Medallion (Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria); and in 1946 the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales. He died at his home in North Adelaide", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wigtown", "response": ["* John McConnell Black, botanist and linguist."]}, {"page": "Solanum centrale", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John McConnell Black"]}, {"page": "John Black", "response": ["*John McConnell Black (1855\u20131951), Australian botanist"]}, {"page": "1932 in Australia", "response": ["* 17 August \u2013 Botanist John McConnell Black is awarded the Mueller Medal by the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science."]}, {"page": "Clarke Medal", "response": ["* 1946: John McConnell Black (Botany)"]}, {"page": "Helen Carte", "response": ["Susan Helen Couper Black was born in Wigtown, Scotland, the second of four children of George Couper Black (1819\u20131863), procurator fiscal and banker, and his second wife, Ellen, n\u00e9e Barham (1822\u20131902).\"George Couper Black\", Ancestry UK, accessed 21 June 2021  One of her brothers, John McConnell Black, became a well-known botanist.

Earlier in 1882, Tepper sent a description and specimens to Ferdinand von Mueller, who labeled the plants as D.\u00a0whittakeri var. aphylla, but never published the name. Its placement at the rank of species was controversial and several authors, including Raymond Hamet in 1907, John McConnell Black in 1924, and Allen Lowrie in 1989, have reorganized it below the species rank. Others have reduced it to synonymy with Drosera whittakeri. In 1991, Robert J. Bates made the case for recognition at the species rank, authoring the illegitimate name D.\u00a0aphylla in the process, a name not based on the first validly published description. Recently, several authors have recognized the taxon at the subspecies or species rank, but others have still only recognized it as a part of the very variable single species D.\u00a0whittakeri sensu lato. In a review of D.\u00a0whittakeri and related species, Lowrie and John Godfrey Conran reestablished it at the species rank, arguing that the morphology is dissimilar enough from D.\u00a0whittakeri that it requires its own species epithet. Lowrie and Conran note that D.\u00a0praefolia is distinct from D.\u00a0whittakeri (whose opposing characteristics presented in parentheses) by its white tubers (orange), leaves emerging after flowering (before flowering), and the ovate to obovate leaf shape (broadly spathulate), among other differences."]}, {"page": "Correa calycina", "response": ["Correa calycina was first formally described in 1925 by John McConnell Black in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia from specimens collected in the Hindmarsh Valley by John Burton Cleland.
