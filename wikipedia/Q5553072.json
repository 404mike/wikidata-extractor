He made his debut on the left wing in a home match against Huddersfield Town on 22 August 1953 at the age of 16 years and 321 days, this made him at the time Arsenal's youngest-ever player (since surpassed by Jermaine Pennant and then Cesc F\u00e0bregas), and until 2008 he held the record for Arsenal's youngest-ever player in a league match, a record now held by Jack Wilshere. As Wilshere's appearance was as a substitute, Ward remains the youngest Arsenal player to ever start a league match.\nWard turned professional soon after his debut and made two more appearances in the 1953-54 season. However, he did not play for Arsenal for another four years after that; a large portion of that time was spent doing National Service, which prevented him from playing. He was demobbed in February 1957 and regained his place in the 1957-58 season, becoming a regular in 1958-59 at wing half. However, with competition from Tommy Docherty he was only a bit-part player between 1960 and 1963, making just 21 appearances over the three seasons. He left Arsenal in July 1963 for Leyton Orient; in all he played 84 times for Arsenal, scoring ten goals.\nHe spent one season at Orient, making 44 appearances and scoring two goals. He had a career in non-league football after that, playing for both Cambridge City and Barnet, whom he also managed for a brief period between 1973 and 1974. He died in 1994, aged 57.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gerry", "response": ["* Gerald Gerry Ward (footballer) (1936\u20131994), English footballer", "* Gerald Gerry Ward (basketball) (born 1941), American retired National Basketball Association player"]}, {"page": "Barnet F.C.", "response": ["*1973  Gerry Ward"]}, {"page": "Jermaine Pennant", "response": ["Pennant's career seemed promising following his move to Arsenal.

He continued to make League Cup appearances over the next few seasons, but had to wait two-and-a-half years for his league debut, as a substitute against West Ham United on 24 August 2002 in the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Gerry Ward", "response": ["Gerry Ward may refer to:", "*Gerry Ward (footballer) (1936\u20131994), English footballer", "*Gerry Ward (basketball) (born 1941), retired American basketball player"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["| 23 April 1960 ||Manchester United||H||5\u20132||41,057||Danny Clapton 7' Jimmy Bloomfield 16', 67', 79' Gerry Ward 88'"]}]}}
