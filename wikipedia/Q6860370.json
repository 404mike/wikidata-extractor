His speeches and writings often ridicule Islam, feminism, social justice and political correctness. Yiannopoulos is a former editor for Breitbart News, a far-right media organisation.Yiannopoulos worked for Breitbart from 2014 until 2017. During his time at Breitbart, Yiannopoulos rose to prominence as a significant voice in the Gamergate controversy. In July 2016, he was permanently banned from Twitter for online harassment of actress Leslie Jones. He was permanently banned from Facebook in 2019.According to hundreds of emails by Yiannopoulos leaked by BuzzFeed in late 2017, Yiannopoulos repeatedly solicited white nationalists, such as American Renaissance editor Devin Saucier, for story ideas and editing suggestions during his tenure at Breitbart.Yiannopoulos has been accused of advocating for paedophilia. The allegation arose from several video clips in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys. Following the release of the video clips, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, his invitation to speak before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was revoked, and a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon & Schuster was cancelled. Yiannopoulos has said that he is not a supporter of paedophilic relationships and that his statements were merely attempts to cope with his own victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 18", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Milo Yiannopoulos, British journalist and public speaker"]}, {"page": "Black bloc", "response": ["In February 2017, an event at the University of California, Berkeley by commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was cancelled by college administrators after protestors of a black bloc broke windows, shot fireworks, and caused a light fixture to catch fire.

Alt-right leader and white nationalist Richard Spencer said that Bannon's awareness of Evola \"means a tremendous amount\". Some members of the alt-right expressed hope that Bannon might have been open to Evola's ideas, and that through Bannon, Evola's ideas could become influential. According to multiple historians cited by The Atlantic, this is contradictory, as Bannon cited Evola in defense of the \"Judeo-Christian west\", while Evola hated and opposed Judaism and Jews, Christianity in general, Anglo-Saxon Protestantism specifically, and the culture of the United States.
