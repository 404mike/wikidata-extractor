Entry is through a decorative gate of wrought iron set into an arch; above the gate, carved onto a plaque of Welsh slate, is an englyn [see box] by Lloyd George's nephew, W. R. P. George, the lettering by Jonah Jones, and a Oeil-de-boeuf opening with the initials DLG, again sculpted in wrought iron. The architectural historian Andrew Saint considers the style of the arch more \"Dutch-Afrikaans\" than Welsh vernacular but notes the use of local building materials. On both internal sides of the gate wall are two further plaques carved with the name, David Lloyd George, and the years of his birth and death. From the gate, the walls, 1m high, curve round to the river, while the encircling path descends 14 steps ending at the river bank, at eye level with the boulder.

A Grade II* listed structure, the authors of the Gwynedd Pevsner, call the site \"a hero's burying-place and a consummate work of landscape design\".
