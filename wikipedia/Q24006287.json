Two days later Brown signed 21-year old left-back Tyler Denton on a season-long loan from Leeds United. Adebayo Akinfenwa put Wycombe Wanderers ahead within two minutes of the opening home game of the season at Vale Park on 12 August, and by the 25-minute mark he had scored the opposition's final goal of a 3\u20132 defeat for the \"Valiants\". In the week following the defeat to Wycombe, both Anton Forrester and Danny Pugh were ruled out of action for three to four months, and Brown signed 20-year old Sheffield Wednesday winger Jack Stobbs on a season-long loan. The match at Chesterfield was declared \"Ernie Moss Day\" in tribute to the legend of both clubs, but another poor performance saw Vale slip to a 2\u20130 defeat to a side that had previously failed to pick up a point. Fans booed the team and turned on the manager, chanting 'You don't know what you're doing'. In the week building up to the local derby with Crewe Alexandra, Brown signed highly rated midfielder David Worrall. Worrall made his debut against Crewe, but it was midfield partner Michael Tonge who made the headlines for the wrong reasons, as he was sent off four minutes after Crewe's Chris Dagnall scored the only goal of the game on the half-hour mark; Brown said that Tonge was unlucky to be sent off and he was proud of his team's performance. On the final day before the summer transfer window closed, Brown signed Burnley centre-back Tom Anderson on a season-long loan and Doncaster Rovers central midfielder Harry Middleton on a free transfer.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||19||align=\"left\"| Dan Turner", "|\u2013||FW||||19||Dan Turner||3||0||0||0||3", "|19||||MF||Dan Turner||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "| 17 January 2018 || CF ||  || Dan Turner || Tamworth || 17 February 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Neil Aspin's first signing of the window was 33-year-old goalkeeper Scott Brown, who had been an ever-present for Wycombe Wanderers when they won promotion out of EFL League Two the previous season. Aspin stated that Brown's experience would help with organising the Vale's young defenders on the pitch. He quickly followed this by bringing in 30-year-old Carlisle United midfielder Luke Joyce on a two-year contract and 24-year-old Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels on a six-month contract, describing Joyce as \"vastly experienced\" and Daniels as \"a local lad who is desperate to prove himself\". Next to arrive were centre-backs Leon Legge and Connell Rawlinson, arriving on free transfers after leaving Cambridge United and The New Saints respectively. Aspin said that he hoped the experience of Legge would aid the development of young centre-half Nathan Smith. His sixth signing was central midfielder Manny Oyeleke, who had just left National League side Aldershot Town after picking up their Player of the Year award. After a wait of some weeks, the seventh incoming player was revealed to be attacker Louis Dodds, who joined on a season-long loan from relegated Chesterfield; he had previously played for the Vale from 2008 to 2016. Aspin said that Dodds had been keen on a return to Vale Park and \"he has cost us next to nothing really\". Vale then acquired the services of Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller after paying an undisclosed fee; 29-year-old Miller had scored a remarkable goal tally in the National League but had thus far failed to establish himself in the Football League in a career hindered by legal troubles. Another Peterborough forward then arrived, this time 18-year-old Idris Kanu on a season-long loan, whilst defender Theo Vassell was also signed on a one-year deal from Aspin's former club Gateshead. Going the other way, 20-year-old forward Dan Turner joined Scottish Championship club Falkirk on a six-month loan deal \u2013 which was terminated early on 5 October. Taking his place at Vale Park was Scott Quigley, signed on a season-long loan from Blackpool. Aspin also went on to sign former Stevenage midfielder Tom Conlon, who had impressed whilst on trial.", "With a final position of 20th being the joint-lowest in the club's history (along with 1979\u201380 and 2017\u201318), albeit with an improved points tally of 49, Askey released nine of the ten out of contract players: Dior Angus, Harry Benns, Mike Calveley, Danny Elliott, Luke Hannant, Antony Kay, Michael Tonge, Dan Turner and Theo Vassell, with Sam Hornby the only one to be offered a new deal (he rejected the deal and instead joined Bradford City). He also transfer listed Connell Rawlinson and Ben Whitfield. Askey himself signed a new three-year contract, whilst Leon Legge and David Worrall also signed contract extensions.
