And it ends on a hell of a cliffhanger. No scholarly, and intellectually provocative, historical novel has been this much fun since The Name of the Rose\". Patrick Ness considers Quicksilver to be \"entertaining over an impossible distance. This isn't a book; it's a place to move into and raise a family.\" His review focuses on the scope of the material and humour inherent in Quicksilver. Mark Sanderson calls the novel an \"astonishing achievement\", and compares Quicksilver to \"Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon and Lawrence Norfolk's Lempriere's Dictionary.\" Although full of historical description and incredibly lengthy, Quicksilver is noticeably full of what Sanderson called \"more sex and violence\u00a0... than any Tarantino movie\".
