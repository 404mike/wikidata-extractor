Lady Anne, a sister of the 11th Duke of Devonshire, was a noted prison reformer and her husband, Michael, was the son of Nancy Lancaster, the interior designer. They had earlier lived at Mereworth Castle in Kent, and had a connection to Geoffrey Jellicoe though work he had undertaken for Nancy and Ronald Tree at Ditchley Park in the 1930s. By the time of his work at Shute House, Jellicoe had become one of England's most successful landscape gardeners. Training originally as an architect, he moved into landscape gardening in the 1930s, helping to establish the Institute of Landscape Architects and becoming the founding president of the International Federation of Landscape Architects. During a 60-year career, he designed a series of major gardens, both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. He also made a significant contribution to landscape gardening theory; exploring, in particular, links between design and the subconscious, in which he was much influenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, and the use of water in design. The joint work Jellicoe wrote with his wife, Susan Pares, Water: The Use of Water in Landscape Architecture, was published while he was engaged at Shute."]}]}}
