In the Sunday Times on 11 November 2007, he revealed the previously unknown identity of the model as 27-year-old mother-of-two Lucy Joplin. In an interview with Barrell, Joplin explained that the \"faraway look\" in her eyes was the result of an evening consuming absinthe and opium, and that she was paid just \u00a375 in cash for the shoot.
