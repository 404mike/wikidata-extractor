The Domesday Book (1086) has two entries under Eslaforde (Sleaford) recording land held by Ramsey Abbey and the Bishop of Lincoln. The location of the manors recorded in Domesday is unclear. One theory endorsed by Maurice Beresford is that they focused on the settlement at Old Sleaford, due to evidence that New Sleaford was planted in the 12th century by the bishop to increase his income, a development associated with the construction of Sleaford Castle between 1123 and 1139.Mahany and Roffe 1973, p. 11. Beresford's theory has been criticised by the local historians Christine Mahany and David Roffe who have reinterpreted the Domesday material and argued that in 1086 the Bishop's manor included the church and associated settlement which became \"New\" Sleaford.Mahany and Roffe 1979, pp. 13\u201314.Pawley 1996, pp. 15\u201316."]}, {"page": "Sutton Coldfield", "response": ["*Maurice Beresford (1920\u20132005) \u2013 medieval archaeologist, Professor of Economic History at the University of Leeds."]}, {"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 February \u2013 Maurice Beresford, historian and archaeologist (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Wharram Percy", "response": ["The earthworks of the village have been known for many years, and outlines of house platforms were drawn onto the first Ordnance Survey six-inch maps of Yorkshire published in 1854.O.S.
