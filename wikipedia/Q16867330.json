One of their most enigmatic finds was an adult male burial at the rear of a rampart in the fortifications where a horse's head had been carefully placed upon the body.Haselgrove, C. and Turnbull, P. with Fitts, M. and Van der Veen, M.: \"Stanwick: Excavation and Research \u2013 Third Interim Report 1985-86\", page 10, University of Durham, Department of Archaeology, Occasional Paper No.8, 1987 and Haselgrove, C: 'Stanwick' in \"Current Archaeology\" No. 119 (pp. 380\u2013384), page 384 Turnbull and Haselgrove argued that Stanwick's huge outer circuit of ditches and banks had probably been built first, during the mid-first century\u00a0AD, and then the inner area sub-divided. They maintained that the  fortification was too long to be easily defended and that its enormous size was intended instead to emphasise the power, prestige and wealth of its owner. They concluded that Stanwick had not been the fortress stronghold of Venutius but was rather the estate of his ex-wife, Queen Cartimandua, and possibly even the original tribal capital of the Brigantes."]}, {"page": "Mellor hill fort", "response": ["The study of hill forts was popular in the 19th century, with a revival in the 20th century due to excavations at Danebury.Cunliffe (1983), p.\u00a012.  However it was not until the 1990s that the settlement at Mellor was discovered; the site had a lack of tell-tale earthworks, such as a circular ditch (which would indicate ancient activity).Nevell & Redhead (2005), p.\u00a020.  Excavations began in 1998 where unusual marks had been noted in 1995 during a drought. Instead of the medieval ditch the marks were thought to denote, the ditch of an Iron Age hill fort was revealed.  As of 2009 the excavations are ongoing.  Before these excavations began, relatively little was known about the prehistory of the Stockport area before about 1,200\u00a0BC.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p.\u00a049. It was generally thought that the areas of Marple and Mellor had been mostly untouched by prehistoric human activity, including during the Romano-British period. Little is known about Iron Age activity in North West England as pottery is rare on the sites excavated in the region, and there is a dearth of settlement sites. Of the more than 1,300\u00a0hill forts found in EnglandForde-Johnston (1962), pp.\u00a013\u201314. relatively few are in the northwest. The paucity of known sites led archaeologist Colin Haselgrove to describe the region as a \"black hole\" for the Iron Age.Hodgson & Brennand (2006), p.\u00a051.
