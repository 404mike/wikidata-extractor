Five minutes into the match, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne and Leeds captain Bobby Collins collided, which resulted in Byrne breaking his collarbone. As substitutions were not allowed, Byrne decided to continue playing. He was unaware of the extent of his injury, as manager Shankly decided against telling him. The first action of the match was from a Liverpool free-kick, which Willie Stevenson played into the Leeds penalty area. Leeds goalkeeper Gary Sprake and defender Jack Charlton did not deal with it and it went out of play for a Liverpool corner. Liverpool captain Ron Yeats headed the ball on from the corner and striker Ian St John was close to reaching it, before it was gathered by Sprake. Leeds were trying to get winger Albert Johanneson into the match, but a pass to him from Johnny Giles was intercepted by Liverpool defender Tommy Smith. He passed to Ian Callaghan, who advanced before passing to Stevenson, he and Smith exchanged passes before Stevenson passed to Callaghan, whose shot was saved by Sprake.", "|MF ||6 || Willie Stevenson"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|LH || Willie Stevenson"]}, {"page": "Ainslie Park High School", "response": ["* Willie Stevenson, footballer"]}, {"page": "1966 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||6 || Willie Stevenson "]}, {"page": "Tony Allen (footballer)", "response": ["Midway through the 1966\u201367 season Allen's pace began to desert him, so Waddington switch him to centre back alongside Maurice Setters this allowed him to prolong his career until Willie Stevenson was signed from Liverpool in 1967.
