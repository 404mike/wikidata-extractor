He is a researcher at IMPA.In 2015, Morris was awarded the European Prize in Combinatorics for \"his profound results in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics particularly for his result on independent sets in hypergraphs which found immediately several applications in additive number theory and combinatorics, such as the solution of old problem of Erd\u0151s and for establishing tight bounds for Ramsey numbers, and also on random cellular automata and bootstrap problems in percolation.\"In 2016, he was one of the winners of the George P\u00f3lya Prize.He graduated with a Ph.D. from The University of Memphis in 2006 under the supervision of B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.He was awarded the 2018 Fulkerson Prize.
