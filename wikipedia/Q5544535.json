As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU\u2013PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias. The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that \"he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist\", while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was \"just rhetoric\" with \"no genuine vision or belief behind it\". Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, \"of course he didn't actually practise what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist\". Mugabe has stated that \"socialism has to be much more Christian than capitalism\".
