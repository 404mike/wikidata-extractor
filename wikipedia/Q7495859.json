It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to create a group for TV appearances. Farian found model-turned-singer Maizie Williams (originally from Montserrat) and her Jamaican singer friend Sheyla Bonnick, along with a dancer known only as \"Mike\" for the early performances. Also during 1975, a singer named Nathalie joined but was soon replaced by Jamaican-born Claudja Barry. Then Bonnick and Mike left, and Maizie Williams brought in Bobby Farrell, a male exotic dancer from Aruba. Singer Marcia Barrett (from Jamaica) joined the group, who brought in Liz Mitchell, a former member of the Les Humphries Singers to replace Claudja Barry who left in February 1976 to pursue a solo career. The enduring Boney M. line-up was Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, and Bobby Farrell."]}, {"page": "Maizie Williams", "response": ["Brought up in Birmingham, England, Williams began working as a model, eventually gaining the title Miss Black Beautiful in a contest in 1973. After this initial success she went on to front her own band \u2014 Black Beautiful People. She later moved to West Germany with her friend Sheyla Bonnick. One day in 1975, while at a restaurant, the two were approached by an agent who asked if they were interested in joining a new pop group called Boney M. \"She asked if we could sing. Well, you don't say no, do you,\" Williams later recalled in an interview. She had previously been singing with a local band back in England but had been told off by her brother Billy: \"You have a terrible voice.

The threesome recorded the follow-up single \"Daddy Cool\" which soon became a worldwide hit and launched the group's phenomenal career, with numerous hit singles and albums over the next decade. Williams and Bobby Farrell did not sing on the records since \"their voices weren't suited for this particular kind of music\" as Farian put it in a Bravo interview in 1978. It did not create a scandal \u2013 both Williams and Farrell did sing during the group's many live performances during their extensive world tours 1977\u20131979.  Williams remained with the group until the ultimate break-up in 1990. In 1994, she did what her former colleagues Liz Mitchell and Bobby Farrell had also done, she formed her own Boney M group, billed as Boney M featuring Maizie Williams. The group also featured Sheyla Bonnick from the short-lived original 1975 line-up. Williams herself would finally front as a lead singer in the group's renditions of the hits \"Brown Girl in the Ring\", \"Hooray! Hooray!
