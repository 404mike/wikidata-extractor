Moses Ugbusien took the baton rather casually, the slow start giving Darren Clark the chance to pass during the curve, putting Australia into the lead at the break.  Taking an efficient tangent from lane 8, Ray Armstead gained ground on Ugbusien, moving to his shoulder to try to make a pass for the Americans on the stretch, 4 meters behind Clark who was running a 43.86 split, which exactly equalled Lee Evans' world record at the time. Ugbusien didn't relent and the two teams passed virtually even. On the handoff, Alonzo Babers got the edge, trying to keep up with Rotimi Peters. The long striding Babers took off in pursuit of Gary Minihan, with the three teams well ahead of the next pursuing team from Great Britain. Coming off the final turn, Babers smoothly went past Minihan and pulled away to a 7 meter lead by the handoff to Antonio McKay.Mens X Metres Relay at Sports Reference Behind the action at the front, Todd Bennett steadily chipped away what was more than a 10 meter deficit to put Britain but a step behind Nigeria at the final handoff.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/10186628/Todd-Bennett-Olympic-400m-silver-medallist-in-1984-dies-aged-51.html McKay kept the American lead for the victory. There a was a battle for the other medals, with Rick Mitchell holding the Australian advantage of about two meters over Innocent Egbunike for Nigeria, with Phil Brown another step back for Britain. With Egbunike training at an American university Azusa Pacific, he was quite familiar to the spectators. Down the backstretch, Egbunike gained on Mitchell, moving on to his outside shoulder to pounce coming off the final turn. Behind Egbunike, Brown was staying in close contact still on the inside. Then, as Egbunike attacked, Brown went to the outside making it three abreast with 70 meters to go. Mitchell couldn't keep up, but Egbunike and Brown ran stride for stride for 50 meters. In the final 20 meters, Brown gained a slight advantage and crossed the line ahead for the silver medal. Nigeria's consolation was the African continental record.", "|style=\"width:13em\" valign=top| Kriss AkabusiTodd BennettDenver MillsGarry Cook", "|Kriss Akabusi, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Phil Brown", "|Kriss Akabusi, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Phil Brown", "|(Kriss Akabusi, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Phil Brown) "]}, {"page": "1983 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|Ainsley BennettGarry CookTodd BennettPhilip Brown", "# (Kriss Akabusi, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Philip Brown) 3:10.19 Q", "# (Kriss Akabusi, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Philip Brown) 3:04.03 Q", "# (Ainsley Bennett, Garry Cook, Todd Bennett, Philip Brown) 3:03.53"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1986 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Kriss AkabusiRoger BlackTodd BennettPhil Brown ||3:07.19"]}]}}
