The two other divisions in XII Corps were the 43rd (Wessex) and 44th (Home Counties) Divisions, commanded respectively by Major Generals Charles Allfrey (from late February) and Brian Horrocks (from late June), both of whom were known to Stopford, having been fellow instructors at the Staff College, Camberley before the war. Thanks to his predecessor, Major General Liardet, a TA officer who had been GOC for well over three years, the division, which had not seen action in France, was relatively well trained and reasonably well-equipped and, with the arrival of Montgomery as the new corps commander, large-scale exercises became common, getting progressively more difficult each week.Williams, pps. 15\u221216 Montgomery, already well known for his tendency to dismiss senior officers who failed to live up to his standards, appears to have formed a high opinion of Stopford, as the latter was not sacked, and may well have secured for him his next appointment, as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, handing over command of the 56th Division to Major General Eric Miles in early October.Williams, p. 17"]}, {"page": "Commandant-General of the RAF Regiment", "response": ["| Sir Claude Liardet"]}, {"page": "Claude Francis Liardet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claude Liardet"]}, {"page": "C F Liardet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claude Liardet"]}, {"page": "Liardet", "response": ["*Claude Liardet, Major General in the British Army", "*Henry Maughan Liardet, Major General in the British Army, son of Claude Liardet"]}, {"page": "Eric Hayes", "response": ["Hayes did not remain with his battalion long, however, as, in January 1940, he returned to England to become Commandant of the Company Commanders' School, and, in August, was promoted to brigadier and given command of the 35th Infantry Brigade, a second-line Territorial Army (TA) unit, which had recently fought in the Battle of France where it had suffered heavy losses.
