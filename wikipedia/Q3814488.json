He scored 145 goals in the Football League from 396 appearances with five clubs. Internationally he won 13 caps and scored five goals, and was a member of the Welsh squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden although he did not play during the tournament.\nLeek started his career with Northampton Town aged 17 despite only playing football for three years. After six years, he earned a move to First Division Leicester City. He had three seasons at Leicester, and scored in every round of the FA Cup en route to the 1961 final. He was dropped from the final and soon moved on to Newcastle United. His stay with Newcastle was brief and he signed for Birmingham City before the end of the year, having had a loan spell in Canada with Montreal Concordia. He played more than 100 games with Birmingham, scoring nearly a goal every other game including two in the 1963 League Cup triumph against rivals Aston Villa. He returned to Northampton, helping them to promotion to the top flight before finishing his professional career with Bradford City. His career took him onto three Welsh non-league sides.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["Banks faced competition from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old Scotland international Johnny Anderson and 25-year-old Dave MacLaren. He started the 1959\u201360 season as the reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren. He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September. The match finished 1\u20131, with Jackie Mudie's strike cancelling out Ken Leek's opener. Banks retained his place for the 2\u20130 loss to Newcastle United at St James' Park three days later. With McLaren fit again, Banks was sent back to the reserves but, after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games, he was recalled and became the first-choice goalkeeper for the remainder of the season. The defensive record did not improve at first, with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, but he improved in each match and the Foxes settled for a comfortable 12th-place finish. In training, he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses, such as coming for crosses. He put in extra hours during training and came up with practice sessions to improve his skills \u2013 this was largely unique in an era where there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches. In the summer, both Anderson and MacLaren departed, leaving Banks as the club's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies.", "Leicester finished sixth in 1960\u201361, and managed to beat champions Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Yet their greatest accomplishment was in reaching the final of the FA Cup, with Banks conceding only five goals in their nine games en route to the final, and keeping three clean sheets in the semi-final and two replays against Sheffield United. Goals from Jimmy Walsh and Ken Leek finally broke the deadlock in the second replay at St Andrew's. Their opponents in the final at Wembley were Tottenham, who had already won the First Division title by an eight-point margin. Right-back Len Chalmers picked up a severe injury early in the match, and with Ken Leek dropped for disciplinary reasons in favour of rookie Hughie McIlmoyle, City were effectively playing with ten men and offered little threat going forward. Bobby Smith and Terry Dyson gave Spurs a 2\u20130 win and the first \"double\" of the 20th century, with Banks unable to prevent either goal."]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["*  Ken Leek (1958)"]}, {"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Ken Leek"]}, {"page": "Ynysybwl", "response": ["* Ken Leek - footballer, Welsh International, played for Northampton, Leicester, Newcastle, Birmingham, Northampton, Bradford City, Rhyl, Merthyr, Ton Pentre."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 in English football", "response": ["*19 November 2007 \u2013 Ken Leek, 72, former Welsh international striker, who won the 1963 League Cup with Birmingham City; also played for Northampton Town, Leicester City, Newcastle United and Bradford City."]}, {"page": "Second City derby", "response": ["| Ken Leek"]}, {"page": "Gil Merrick", "response": ["Although Merrick spent well in the transfer market, bringing in such players as Jimmy Harris and Welshman Ken Leek, Blues failed to make much impact on the First Division, and finished 17th in the 1961\u201362 season.

After Birmingham finished 19th in 1959\u201360, having been in or just above the relegation places throughout the season, Merrick was appointed first-team manager. He was unable to improve the team's league performance, but did lead them to the first major trophy in the club's history. Entry to the new League Cup competition, introduced in 1960\u201361, was optional; several top-flight clubs chose not to enter, but Birmingham did so from the first year.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 29\u201331. In 1962\u201363, while avoiding relegation only by winning two of their last three matches, they showed their best form in reaching the League Cup final, which was played over two legs on the grounds of the competing clubs. Opponents Aston Villa were pre-match favourites, having beaten Birmingham 4\u20130 in their most recent league meeting. But in the home leg Birmingham \"served up a treat of attacking football\u00a0... controlling the game with such assurance that their supporters must have wondered why the team had performed so badly in the First Division\", and came out comfortable 3\u20131 winners, with two goals from Ken Leek and one from Jimmy Bloomfield.
