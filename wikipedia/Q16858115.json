These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority for the establishment of parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief by the end of the century.E.P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class, at 147. Full text available at https://libcom.org/library/making-english-working-class-ep-thompson Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief. An investigation of the history and current state of the Poor Laws was made by Michael Nolan in his 1805 Treatise of the Laws for the Relief and Settlement of the Poor. The work would go on to three subsequent editions in Nolan's lifetime (Nolan was elected an MP for Barnstaple in 1820), and stoked the discussion both within and outside of Parliament."]}, {"page": "Barnstaple (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Michael Nolan"]}, {"page": "Michael Nolan", "response": ["Michael Nolan may refer to:", "*Michael Nolan (MP) (died 1827), Irish barrister, judge, politician and legal author", "*Michael Nolan, Baron Nolan (1928\u20132007), British retired judge"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|8 March 1824||Barnstaple||c*||Michael Nolan||Frederick Hodgson||Chief Justice of the Brecon Circuit"]}, {"page": "List of ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|8 March 1824||Barnstaple||c*||Michael Nolan||Frederick Hodgson||Chief Justice of the Brecon Circuit"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Barnstaple(two members)||Michael Nolan||", "|rowspan=\"2\"| 8 March 1824 || Barnstaple || Michael Nolan || || Frederick Hodgson || || Nolan resigned to become Chief Justice of the Brecon Circuit"]}]}}
