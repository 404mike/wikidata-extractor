She was also a regular presenter of Sport on Friday, and of the children's programme Newsround during the 1980s.\nBorn in London, Rollason studied to become a PE teacher before entering radio broadcasting in 1980. After directing sport related content for Channel 4, where she helped to bring American football to British television, she anchored coverage of the 1987 World Student Games and 1988 Summer Olympics. Her work on Grandstand proved popular with viewers, and led to a number of other sports presenting roles for Rollason throughout the 1990s. As well as covering mainstream events such as the 1996 Summer Olympics, she became a champion of disability sports, helping to raise its profile and change its public and media perception. She presented sports bulletins for BBC Breakfast News and BBC News, and in 1996 was named as Sports Presenter of the Year.\nRollason was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1997, and fought a two-year battle with the disease. A 1998 documentary, Hope for Helen, followed her treatment, and won her much public support for her courage. She continued to work throughout her illness, and shortly before her death was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours. Later that year, the BBC established an award in her memory which is presented at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. A cancer charity was also founded in her name. Rollason's television career also helped to open up the way for other women to enter the world of sports broadcasting, with presenters such as Sue Barker and Gabby Logan following in her footsteps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*1999 \u2013 Helen Rollason, English sports journalist and sportscaster (b. 1956)"]}, {"page": "March 11", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Helen Rollason, English sports journalist and sportscaster (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Helen Rollason \u2013 BBC Sport 1990-1992"]}, {"page": "Andy Love", "response": ["Love supported Peter Hain in the 2007 deputy leadership election.
