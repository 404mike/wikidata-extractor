At Kensington House Academy, Simon studied English etiquette, French, and music. When she turned eighteen in 1807, she received a communication from her father that no further funds would be forthcoming and that she must earn her own living. She left Kensington and began studying at the school run by Susanna Sala since the death of her husband in 1800. Simon also studied voice with Timothy Essex and Thomas Welsh. She had little contact with her family until 1810, when her grandmother, Dorothy Thomas, arrived with her two youngest children; over a dozen of her Coxall, Garraway, Robertson, and Fullerton cousins; and some of her own siblings from Demerara to enroll them in school. The girls attended Kensington House Academy and the boys were enrolled at Glasgow's Dollar Academy. Simon very probably secured a dowry from her grandmother to facilitate her marriage to Susanna's son Augustus John James Sala on 22 June 1812."]}]}}
