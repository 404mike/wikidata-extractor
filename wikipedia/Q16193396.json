He scored 330 runs with a highest score of 60 not out and took four wickets with a best performance of two for one. Once scored 151 and took five wickets for Harrow vs Eton.\nSince retiring from professional Cricket Robert has taken up competitive duck herding and extreme ironing.\nHe currently stars with the ball for Kew CC 2nd XI, although his performances during fine sessions have become increasingly erratic. In 2016, under the erstwhile leadership of the handsome Steve Van Eeden, Tindall performance was pushed to new heights.
