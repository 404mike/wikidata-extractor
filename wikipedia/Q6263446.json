This happened in a match at Moulsey Hurst in August 1795, when Tufton played for an England XIII versus a Surrey XI. The bowler was John Wells. In his notes about that game, Haygarth says: \"In this match, \"leg before wicket\" is found scored for the first time. In Britcher's printed score-book, Mr J. Tufton is in this match put down as bowled merely, and the leg before wicket added in a note.

East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers. The guest players in this match were John Boorman, Richard Purchase, John Small, David Harris and Tom Taylor for the East and Billy Beldham, Harry Walker, Tom Walker and John Wells for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.Haygarth, p. 96."]}]}}
