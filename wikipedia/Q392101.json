Llanelli Rural Council addresses some part of the town, but mainly the Llanelli Rural community. Llanelli's politics has been Labour-dominated for decades. Its geographical location has led to a sense of exceptionalism in relation to the rest of Carmarthenshire, which is dominated by Plaid Cymru. In reaction to this, there have been calls to reinstate the local government district of Llanelli either as a county or as the City of Llanelli."]}, {"page": "Denzil Davies", "response": ["He stood down at the 2005 general election, and was replaced by Nia Griffith.

This sparked a row within the Labour Party, with more than 30 backbenchers signing an Early Day Motion \"unequivocally\" blaming Russia for the attack and several frontbenchers, including shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, stating that Russia was to blame. A poll on 17 March found only 16% of voters believed Corbyn would be the best person to deal with the UK's relations with Russia, compared to 39% saying Theresa May."]}, {"page": "Chris Grayling", "response": ["Boris Johnson reportedly hoped for Grayling to be voted in as Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee by the narrow Conservative majority sitting on the committee. The possible appointment prompted criticism from fellow Conservative MPs, acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey and Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, who said his appointment would \"make a mockery\" of the committee. There were fears it would be a \"power grab\" by Johnson and his senior adviser Dominic Cummings designed to avoid accountability over their links to Russia outlined in a suppressed report. On 15 July 2020, opposition committee members instead elected independently minded Conservative Julian Lewis as chair, who by voting alongside them secured a majority for himself."]}, {"page": "1956 in Ireland", "response": ["*4 December \u2013 Nia Griffith Welsh Labour Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)."]}, {"page": "Soft left", "response": ["*Nia Griffith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Llanelli || Nia Griffith || Labour || Denzil Davies || Labour"]}, {"page": "Llanelli (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Llanelli is a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
