He joined Hull City in 1921; however, after one year with the club, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday, helping the club win promotion to the First Division before going on to win two Football League titles between 1929 and 1930.\nHe was sold to fellow First Division side Liverpool in 1934 but his spell with the team was severely disrupted by injury.

During his career, he made over 450 appearances in the Football League and also attained 26 caps playing for England, setting an team record for consecutive appearances which stood until 1957.", "link_mentions": {}}}
