He joined Hull City in 1921; however, after one year with the club, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday, helping the club win promotion to the First Division before going on to win two Football League titles between 1929 and 1930.\nHe was sold to fellow First Division side Liverpool in 1934 but his spell with the team was severely disrupted by injury. He later finished his professional career with a season at Cardiff City. During his career, he made over 450 appearances in the Football League and also attained 26 caps playing for England, setting an team record for consecutive appearances which stood until 1957.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernie", "response": ["* Ernie Blenkinsop (1902\u20131969), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Ernest Blenkinsop", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ernie Blenkinsop"]}, {"page": "Blenkinsop", "response": ["*Ernie Blenkinsop (1902\u20131962), English football (soccer) player"]}, {"page": "Harry Burgess (footballer)", "response": ["At the start of the 1930\u201331 season the newly married Harry's form for Wednesday attracted the attention of the England selectors and he made his debut on 20 October 1930 against Northern Ireland at Bramall Lane alongside the great Dixie Dean. He scored twice in a 5\u20131 England win, a match in which three other Wednesday players appeared Ernie Blenkinsop, Alf Strange and Tony Leach.

In his debut season he scored 40 goals for the club and followed by helping the club to win the Second Division title in 1930\u201331. Third Lanark made a significant impact in the First Division the following season, finishing in fourth place. Dewar again showed impressive form, scoring 35 goals in 37 games for Thirds, and was rewarded with three Scotland caps. His international debut was a 3\u20130 defeat to England on 9 April 1932, in which he faced future team-mates Alfred Strange and Ernie Blenkinsop. In his second appearance for Scotland, the 3\u20131 win over France in an International Challenge Match the following month, Dewar scored a hat-trick.

He played 16 games in the 1933\u201334 season then became Wednesday's regular left back when Blenkinsop was surprisingly transferred to Liverpool in April 1934.

Competition for the left back spot was keen even though Wednesday had lost Ernie Blenkinsop to Liverpool the previous season; Ted Catlin had stepped into Blenkinsop's boots and Nibloe was forced to switch to right back to secure a place in the team.

The committee who selected England's players chose the same team for all three matches, changing only two players from the starting lineup of England's last competitive fixture against Scotland in April, namely defenders Tom Cooper and Ernie Blenkinsop coming into the team. England's performance against France was deemed poor, with newspaper the Daily Sketch saying they \"lacked speed and will have to play better if they are to beat Spain\". Committee member Phil Bach told the Spanish press they had not been happy with the performance.
