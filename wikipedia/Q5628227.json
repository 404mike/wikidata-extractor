Life in these plotlands was satirized in a stage play by H. F. Maltby called What Might Happen (1927).

In the first half of the 1930s, Lynn and Walls regularly appeared in the lists of the top ten British film stars.

B. Priestley, Cecil Roberts, Gerald Bullett and R. C. Sherriff. The temporary gentleman became a stock character in inter-war literature. H. F. Maltby's 1919 play A Temporary Gentleman focused on Walter Hope, a junior warehouse clerk who was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps. The character fails to adjust to the post-war reality, being too \"swollen-headed\" to return to his pre-war job; the story was made into a film in 1920. Maltby wrote from experience as a 35 year-old artillery NCO serving under officers who \"were so obviously lower-middle class and suburban and gave themselves such airs and graces. I wondered what would happen to them when the war was over. I could see a terrible debunking before them\". The poet Richard Aldington, considered the characterisation of Hope as too simplistic for a time when thousands of ex-officers were unemployed, sleeping rough and willing to take whatever work they could. Aldington wrote The Case of Lieutenant Hall, a fictional short story about a temporary officer who commits suicide after seeing Maltby's play."]}, {"page": "The Laughter of Fools", "response": ["The Laughter of Fools is a 1933 British drama film directed by Adrian Brunel and starring D.
