During the 1930s he joined the fascist movement, first in the British Union of Fascists and later as a founder of the National Socialist League. During World War II he was interned in Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Union of Fascists", "response": ["The BUF became more antisemitic over 1934\u201335 owing to the growing influence of Nazi sympathisers within the party, such as William Joyce and John Beckett, which provoked the resignation of members such as Dr. Robert Forgan. This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.", "* John Beckett was previously Labour Member of Parliament for Peckham."]}]}}
