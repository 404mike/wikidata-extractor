Robert Hardy stood up and realised to his amazement that he was unhurt.

He noticed that Scofield was lying very still on the ground \"and I saw that his shin-bone was sticking out through his trousers\".

The Shooting Party schedule was ultimately changed to allow James Mason to take over the part of Sir Randolph Nettleby six weeks later.
