He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and remains one of the most popular British poets. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana\", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\nTennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \"Break, Break, Break\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\", and \"Crossing the Bar\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as \"Ulysses\", although \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, \"Ulysses\", and \"Tithonus\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\nA number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplace in the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" (\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\"), \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dante Alighieri", "response": ["Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy. His depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and literature. He is cited as an influence on such English writers as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima, is attributed to him. He is described as the \"father\" of the Italian language, and in Italy he is often referred to as  (\"the Supreme Poet\").

A new code of ethics for 19th-century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the \"Arthur of romance\". This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816, when Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634. Initially, the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets, inspiring, for example, William Wordsworth to write \"The Egyptian Maid\" (1835), an allegory of the Holy Grail. Pre-eminent among these was Alfred Tennyson, whose first Arthurian poem \"The Lady of Shalott\" was published in 1832.See  for the sources that Tennyson used when writing this poem Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works, following in the medieval romance tradition. Tennyson's Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King, however, which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur's life for the Victorian era. It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week. In the Idylls, Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth.See  and  for analyses of The Idylls of the King. Tennyson's works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory's tales to a wider audience.See, for example, . Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory's great compilation of Arthur's tales was published in 1862, shortly after Idylls appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended."]}, {"page": "Poetry", "response": ["A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous.
