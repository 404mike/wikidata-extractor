With the help of the engineer George Parfitt he built one of Britain\u2019s first petrol-powered motor vehicles, Frederick Bremer of Walthamstow having built the first in 1892.  On 17 October 1895, with his assistant James Pullinger, they drove through Farnham, Surrey, whereupon he was prosecuted for using a locomotive with neither a licence nor a man walking in front with a red flag. This is sometimes misreported as the first person to be convicted of speeding in the UK, but that sobriquet subsequently fell to Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, in January 1896.Knight was both an inventor and pioneer, having created a (failed) steam powered road vehicle; a renowned steam powered hop digger; a heat saving radiator; a brick laying machine; a grenade thrower, a speedometer, wooden vehicle tyres, and a patent 'dish lever' for tilting plates when carving meat.\nKnight was a founder member of the Automobile Association and politically active in the repeal of the Red Flag Act, he was also a pioneer of colour photography, plus writing various factual and practical books.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Farnham", "response": ["John Henry Knight (1847\u20131917), who built the first British motor car and designed a number of innovative digging machines for use in hop fields, was born and brought up at Weybourne on the outskirts of the town."]}, {"page": "Daimler Company", "response": ["One of the duties assigned to Simms was to find a suitable location for the factory.

Bought in France by Evelyn Ellis, who had three Daimler motor launches moored by his house at Datchet, it was landed at Southampton on 3 July and driven by Ellis to Micheldever near Winchester where he met Simms.  Ellis drove on to Datchet then to Malvern.  Simms subsequently described their ride in a long letter to the Saturday Review. This was the first long journey by a motorcar in Britain.
