Four years later he won the silver medal as member of the joint City of London Police-Metropolitan Police \"K\" Division British team. In 1908, Munro was also the Scottish wrestling champion, but lost a noted match to Georg Hackenschmidt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tug of war at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Alexander Munro"]}, {"page": "George Hackenschmidt", "response": ["Hackenschmidt defeated the Scottish champion Alexander Munro and Madrali in a return bout at the Olympia, and on 6 February 1908, defeated the American wrestler Joe Rogers in straight falls inside of 14 minutes. He then sailed to the United States to fulfill his obligation to meet a new challenger from Iowa by the name of Frank Gotch.Fleischer, pp. 153\u2013177.Kent, pp. 148\u2013161.", "In his entire professional wrestling career, Hackenschmidt engaged in about 3,000 matches, losing only two. Powerfully built, Hackenschmidt's measurements for his 1905 match with Alexander Munro were: age \u2013 28; weight \u2013 204 pounds; height \u2013 5\u2032, 9\u00bd\u2033; reach \u2013 75\u2033; biceps \u2013 19\u2033; forearm \u2013 15\u00bd\u2033; neck \u2013 22\u2033; chest \u2013 52\u2033; waist \u2013 34\u2033; thigh \u2013 26\u00be\u2033; calf \u2013 18\u2033.Fleischer, p. 172. He also rose to prominence when the governing style of wrestling was the slower, more ponderous Greco-Roman style that emphasized muscle power more than speed, agility and ring generalship, and involved holds only above the waist. Being bulkier of build than his sleeker opponents, and slower of movement, Hackenschmidt's style and temperament were not geared as much to the newly popular catch-as-catch-can style. Hackenschmidt was a natural showman, he was honest, straightforward and serious, and he would finish off his opponents quickly. His manager C. B. Cochran had to convince him to extend his matches and put on a show, which in turn ensured more bookings and sold-out shows. This did not mean the matches were fake, as excluding exhibitions, his matches were all on the level, but he might allow a local wrestler to last ten minutes and collect his \u00a325 prize, and set up a highly publicized match for later in the week, where he would defeat his foe handily.Kent, p. 153. Unlike many other professional wrestlers, including Frank Gotch, Hackenschmidt was never mean, vindictive or unnecessarily rough in the ring, \"contrasting his physical prowess and fighting skills with a quietness of spirit\", David Gentle explained. \"George Hackenschmidt was the epitome of calm, self-assurance and inner peace, with full awareness of his own capabilities and thus like all masters of combat found no need for machoism or outward aggression. His tactic to win was skill and speed, born of confidence in his own ability and fighting prowess\". However, he had three weaknesses. Against a first-class opponent, of whom he faced extremely few, he could be slow to adapt. Gotch reported after their first match that \"every move the Russian made he telegraphed me in advance, which shows that he thinks too slowly\".Fleischer, p. 102."]}, {"page": "Stornoway", "response": ["*Alexander Munro - Olympic tug-of-war medalist and wrestler"]}, {"page": "Tug of war at the 1912 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Alexander Munro (Met)John Sewell (City)John James Shepherd (City)Joseph Dowler (Met)Edwin Mills (City)Frederick Humphreys (City)Mathias Hynes (Met)Walter Chaffe (Met; captain and trainer)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| , Joseph Dowler, Ernest Ebbage,Thomas Homewood, Alexander Munro, William Slade,Walter Tammas, T.
