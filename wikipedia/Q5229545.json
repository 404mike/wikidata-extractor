A few weeks later when they were making the album Mustn't Grumble, they found that they needed an extra song, so they decided to use the tune they had recorded on cassette. Hodges initially had the idea of writing a song about a man who found that his wife had gone when he returned home, but that changed into a song about a man who wanting to leave after realising that his wife never cared for him, and said: \"Oh Darlin' there ain't no pleasin' you.\" Hodges wrote the song largely by himself, although Peacock was consulted in every step of the writing process to ensure that he was happy with the song."]}, {"page": "London Girls", "response": ["The song was written in 1980 in a writing session with Dave Peacock in a cottage in Ashton, East Northamptonshire."]}, {"page": "Brian Pern", "response": ["In addition to Gabriel's cameos, the series features a range of musicians playing themselves including Roger Taylor, Phil Collins, Jools Holland, Rick Wakeman, Rick Parfitt, Chrissie Hynde, Tim Rice, Billy Bragg, Roy Wood, Paul Young, Mark King, Noddy Holder, Martin Kemp, Melanie Chisholm, Chas Hodges, Dave Peacock and Mike Batt."]}, {"page": "Mick Greenwood", "response": ["Greenwood was discovered at New York's The Bitter End by the legendary John Hammond of Columbia Records.
