Wotton was also partly responsible for Insectorum, sive, Minimorum animalium theatrum or Theatre of Insects, although this was not published (as edited by Thomas Muffet) until 1634.\nBy favour of bishop Fox, he was made socius compar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, with leave to travel into Italy for three years. He attended Padua, applied himself to physic, and took the degree of doctor. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 8 February 1528. He does not appear, as often stated, to have been physician to Henry VIII, but did serve the Duke of Norfolk and Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury. He was a fellow censor with Alban Hill in 1555.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1492", "response": ["** Edward Wotton, English physician and zoologist (d. 1555)"]}, {"page": "1555", "response": ["* October 5 \u2013 Edward Wotton, English zoologist (b. 1492)"]}, {"page": "1634 in science", "response": ["* Publication of Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum in London, compiled posthumously from the work of Edward Wotton, Conrad Gesner and Thomas Penny by Thomas Muffet and prepared for publication by Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne."]}, {"page": "Wotton", "response": ["*Edward Wotton, English zoologist"]}, {"page": "Timeline of entomology \u2013 prior to 1800", "response": ["*Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum by Thomas Muffet with Edward Wotton, Conrad Gesner and Thomas Penny posthumously published \u2013 Contains first image of butterfly from North America, a woodblock print from a painting by John White in 1587."]}, {"page": "Thomas Muffet", "response": ["Thomas Muffet first studied silkworms while working in Italy, beginning his continued fascination with arthropods in general, particularly spiders. He is best known for editing and expanding the work Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum (Theatre of Insects), an illustrated guide to the classification and lives of insects. Although he is popularly believed to have authored it, he merely inherited and furthered its progress toward publication, which would not occur until thirty years after his death. The book contained significant contributions by three other scientists, the Swiss Conrad Gesner alongside Edward Wotton and Thomas Penny. It appears that it was ready for the press in 1589 or 1590. The original title page (unused) is dated 1589. Muffet's negotiations with printers in The Hague failed in 1590. After his death his papers were sold to Theodore de Mayerne, one of the physicians who attended James I and Charles I. Mayerne edited the work for publication in 1634, adding an introduction. Muffet's original manuscript (along with Mayerne's own papers) was acquired by Hans Sloane and is now among the Sloane manuscripts in the British Library.Victor Houliston, \"Moffet [Moufet, Muffet], Thomas [T.

Trevor-Roper, \"Mayerne, Sir Theodore Turquet de (1573\u20131655)\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 The prime reason the book was published posthumously was that the English market for books on natural science was weak at the time.

His solo works have not survived and he is primarily known through quotations from other sixteenth-century biologists. It is believed that he broke with Aristotle on classification of caterpillars. He was also a Puritan and as such kept a low profile during the reign of Queen Mary I of England. He is perhaps best known for being partly responsible for the Insectorum, sive, Minimorum animalium theatrum or Theatre of Insects.
