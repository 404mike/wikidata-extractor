Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Ford began his career with Manchester United. When he failed to break into the first team, he was allowed to join Notts County in February 2000. Two years later, after just one league appearance for the Nottingham club, he moved to non-league Ilkeston Town, but left after only a year. In 2004, he joined Gainsborough Trinity, but again left a year later to join Retford United. He left Retford by mutual consent in February 2010 after failing to agree a new contract, but by September 2010, he was back with the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Joseph's Catholic High School, Slough", "response": ["*Ryan Ford, former footballer"]}, {"page": "Ryan Ford", "response": ["Ryan Ford may refer to:", "*Ryan Ford (fighter) (born 1982), Canadian professional boxer", "*Ryan Ford (footballer) (born 1978), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Ford"]}]}}
