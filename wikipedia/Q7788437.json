Sally Drage, writing in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, notes that he was 'particularly influential as the composer of early Sunday School collections'.Clark was born in St Peter's parish in Canterbury and baptized on 5 February 1775. He was apprenticed as a shoemaker to his father, William Clark, and became a Freeman of the City of Canterbury in 1796 on completion of his apprenticeship as he was the son of a Freeman.\nHe married Anne Ledger in St George's Church, Canterbury, in November 1806.  He took over the family business on his father's death in 1823. He retired from business in about 1842-3. He died in Canterbury on 30 May 1859, aged 84.The best-known of his hymn tunes is Cranbrook: it was originally set to the words 'Grace 'tis a charming sound' written by Philip Doddridge, and published in Clark's first book A Sett of Psalm & Hymn Tunes [1805]. Cranbrook was later used as a tune for the Christmas hymn While shepherds watched their flocks by night and is now better known as the tune of the Yorkshire song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at.\nTwo other tunes by Clark were included in the 1933 Methodist Hymn Book with Tunes: they are Crediton (tune 565), which was first published in Clark's Second Set of Psalm Tunes ... with symphonies & an instrumental bass, adapted to the use of country choirs [c. 1807], and Warsaw (tune 606), which was first published in his Third Set of Psalm & Hymn Tunes [1807].", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West gallery music", "response": ["*Thomas Clark"]}, {"page": "Thomas Clark", "response": ["Thomas Clark may refer to:", "*Thomas Clark (writer) (born 1980), Scottish writer", "*Thomas Clark (Upper Canada) (died 1835), Canadian businessman and political figure", "*Sir Thomas Clark, 1st Baronet (1823\u20131900), Lord Provost of Edinburgh 1865\u20131888", "*Thomas Clark (Long Beach) (born 1926), mayor of Long Beach, California, 1975\u20131980, and 1982\u20131984", "*Thomas Clark (composer) (1775\u20131859), composer of West Gallery music", "*Thomas Clark (actor)English stage actor", "*Thomas Clark (chemist) (1801\u20131867), British chemist", "*Thomas Clark (cricketer), eighteenth-century cricketer", "*Thomas Clark (rower) (1906\u20131990), American Olympic rower", "*Thomas Clark (North Carolina soldier) (1741\u20131792), American officer of the American Revolutionary War", "*Thomas Clarke (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Clark (of Canterbury)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Clark (composer)"]}, {"page": "O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness", "response": ["\"O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness\" first appeared in published hymnals in 1792. Jeffrey Richards states that \"William Williams's O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness of 1772 (sung variously to Thomas Clark's Calcutta, by Baptists; to  Henry Gauntlett's Triumph, in The Scottish Hymnal; to Edwin Moss's Ulpha, in the 1982 Presbyterian Church Praise) did not make it into Hymns Ancient and Modern, but it was in Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody in 1833 and was still to be found complete in the 1933 Baptist Hymnal \u2026 This very much set the tone for missionary hymns.\" After being published in 374 hymnals throughout history, in the 1960s the hymn stopped being published in all Christian hymnals. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints retained the hymn in their hymnals from 1927 until dropping it in 1985. This was because its members in modern times felt that the hymn connected Native Americans and black people with barbarians."]}]}}
