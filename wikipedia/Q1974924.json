In Spring 1919, Max Bauer \u2013 an Army colonel who had been the primary advisor to Ludendorff on politics and economics \u2013 published Could We Have Avoided, Won, or Broken Off the War?, in which he wrote that \"[The war] was lost only and exclusively through the failure of the homeland.\" The birth of the specific term \"stab-in-the-back\" itself can possibly be dated to the autumn of 1919, when Ludendorff was dining with the head of the British Military Mission in Berlin, British general Sir Neill Malcolm. Malcolm asked Ludendorff why he thought Germany lost the war. Ludendorff replied with his list of excuses, including that the home front failed the army."]}, {"page": "Paul von Hindenburg", "response": ["In 1919, Hindenburg was subpoenaed to appear before the parliamentary commission investigating the responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1914 and for the defeat in 1918.Dorpalen, 1964, pp. 48\u201353. He was wary, as he had written: \"The only existing idol of the nation, undeservedly my humble self, runs the risk of being torn from its pedestal once it becomes the target of criticism.\".Pyta, Wolfram \"Hindenburg and the German Right\" pp. 25\u201347 from The German Right in the Weimar Republic: Studies in the History of German Conservatism, Nationalism, and Antisemitism edited by Larry Eugene Jones, Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2014 p. 32. Ludendorff was summoned also. They had been strangers since Ludendorff's dismissal, but they prepared and arrived together on 18 November 1919. Hindenburg refused to take the oath until Ludendorff was permitted to read a statement that they were under no obligation to testify since their answers might expose them to criminal prosecution, but they were waiving their right of refusal. On the stand Hindenburg read through a prepared statement, ignoring the chairman's repeated demands that he answer questions. He testified that the German Army had been on the verge of winning the war in the autumn of 1918 and that the defeat had been precipitated by a Dolchsto\u00df (\"stab in the back\") by disloyal elements on the home front and unpatriotic politicians, quoting a dinner conversation he had Sir Neill Malcolm. When his reading was finished Hindenburg walked out of the hearings, despite being threatened with contempt, sure that they would not dare charge a war hero. His testimony introduced the Dolchsto\u00dflegende, which was adopted by nationalist and conservative politicians who sought to blame the socialist founders of the Weimar Republic for losing the war. Reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented General Frederick Barton Maurice's book about the last months of the war firmed-up this myth. Ludendorff had used these reviews to convince Hindenburg.  A 1929 film glorifying his life as a dedicated patriot solidified his image.Anna Menge,  \"The Iron Hindenburg: a popular icon of Weimar Germany\".

Neill Malcolm (Chief of Staff Reserve Army) recorded several instances in his diary (6 July, 13 July, 18 July) of corps commanders chafing at his \"interference\". Before coming under Gough's command, Hunter-Weston (GOC VIII Corps) wrote to his wife (1 July) of his personal liking for Gough \u2013 by 3 August he wrote to her that his staff were glad to be moving to the Second Army at Ypres, that Reserve Army staff had not run smoothly and that although he liked Gough and thought him \"a good soldier ... he is hardly a big minded enough man to make a really good Army Commander\". He also complained of Gough's \"impetuosity\" and \"optimism\".Sheffield & Todman 2004, pp. 83\u201385Simpson 2006, pp. 41\u201343", "Gough also clashed badly with Philip Howell, Chief of Staff of II Corps.Howell, who was \"a poor man and keen\", and had been opposed to Gough over the Curragh, had been called \"the most mischievous pessimist in France (by Maj-Gen Frederick Glubb, Chief Engineer Second Army) and told \"he must cheer up\" to save his career by Maj-Gen Sir Robert Montgomery, CRA Third Army (letters to wife, 18 and 19 July 1915), but was later praised as \"an exceptionally brilliant officer\", \"largely responsible for the success achieved by the II Corps on the Somme\" (Lt Gen Sir Francis Nosworthy to Edmonds in 1930s). [Robbins 2005, pp. 7, 69] [Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 84] Howell thought Gough \"very loveable in many ways\", if perhaps not quite sane, and \"really quite a child & can be managed like one if treated as such & humoured\". By 24 July 1916 Howell was writing that Gough and Malcolm had \"managed to put everybody's back up\" and throughout August 1916 complained repeatedly about Army-level micromanagement, with Reserve Army allegedly even taking direct control of four of 12th Division machine guns during an attack on 2 August. Philip Howell claimed (29 August 1916) that Jacob (II Corps), Percival (49th Division) and even Neill Malcolm (!) were terrified of Gough. Gough thought Howell a \"great thorn\" who spent much time \"trying to argue\", avoiding fighting and disobeying orders. Howell was killed by shellfire in September.Sheffield & Todman 2004, pp. 85\u201387Simpson 2006, p. 94Robbins 2005, pp. 33, 48", "A 5 October 1916 memo (over Neill Malcolm's signature) for the guidance of division and brigade commanders (bypassing corps), sheds light on Gough's tactical thinking. Although he understood the importance of the creeping barrage and of mopping-up parties, he was \u2013 unlike Rawlinson \u2013 uninterested in bite and hold tactics and tended to feel that opportunities would be lost if infantry were obliged to stop at a predetermined point to stick to an artillery plan.Sheffield & Todman 2004, pp. 88\u201389", "Sheffield comments that this sequence of events indicates that Haig enjoyed warmer relations with Gough than with, say, Rawlinson, but also suggests that he felt the need to supervise him closely. He also comments that although Gough consulted his subordinates, it is unclear that he took their advice: Simon Robbins quotes evidence of warnings from some corps, division and brigade staffs that troops were exhausted and conditions too poor to attack.Robbins 2006 pp. 20\u201321Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 90\u201391W. B. Wood, one of the Official History writing team, later wrote (in 1944) that \"I first began to be suspicious of (Gough) when I found that he had forced Jacob (II Corps) to attack at Grandcourt in November 1916 against the latter's better judgement and more accurate information, thereby sharing a tendency to overrule the man on the spot and force him to submit to his own congenital optimism\". (Travers 1987, pp. 186\u2013188) Neill Malcolm's Memorandum on Operations (13 November 1916) recorded the political reasons for the attack.Simpson 2006, pp. 48\u201349", "By 26 August the rain had become torrential. XVIII Corps attacks on the St Julien spur failed (27 August), while that day Inverness Copse (on the Gheluveld Plateau) resisted its fourth assault. Simpson writes that the large attacks on 27 August were, like those on 22 August, \"no more successful than those before\". Farrar-Hockley blames the attack on Haig's orders to \"press the enemy\" and on Neill Malcolm's \"speaking savagely\" to the corps commanders.Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 230 The Official History writes that the attack resulted in \"considerable further casualties and very little gain in ground\". Plumer's biographer describes it as \"a bloody fiasco\" in which some of Gough's men were left standing up to their knees in water for up to ten hours before zero hour. Prior & Wilson write that Gough's troops were exhausted by now after repeated attacks. Gough ordered another attack for 31 August.Prior & Wilson 1996, pp. 107\u2013108Powell 2004, pp. 210\u2013211", "With a breakthrough apparently imminent, Haig ordered (26 September) that forces for exploitation, including cavalry, be ready to exploit to Roulers by 10 October, ready to link up with the long-postponed coastal advance and seaborne landing. Gough protested that 16 October was a more realistic date (Plumer's suggestion was 13\u201314 October) but was over-ruled by Haig.Prior & Wilson 1996, pp. 133\u2013134 Gough appears to have anticipated a dramatic exploitation by mounted cavalry, but marginal notes by Haig on a memo from Neill Malcolm (1 October) indicate that he had misunderstood the Commander-in-Chief's intent \u2013 Haig envisaged cavalry being used more cautiously at first, in a dismounted role, in the event of German resistance breaking, a far cry from the dramatic exploitation which had been anticipated at the Somme.Sheffield 2011, p. 240", "At a corps commanders' conference on 3 February, Gough warned them that intelligence had deduced that von Hutier, who had recently taken Riga in September 1917, was opposite them.Simpson 2006, p. 135 Edward Beddington acted as Fifth Army Chief of Staff until 10 February 1917, when Neill Malcolm's replacement Brigadier-General Jocelyn Percy became available. Beddington later wrote highly of Gough's active mind, \"full of ideas, some excellent and some the reverse\".Farrar-Hockley 1975, p. 251 Gough also badgered Haig and Petain (Anthoine, his old colleague from Third Ypres, was now Chief of Staff at French GQG) and was assured that Humbert's French Third Army at Clermont was earmarked to reinforce him.Farrar-Hockley 1975, pp. 259\u2013260", "Haig inspected the front with Gough (7 March). From north to south Fifth Army then consisted of Congreve's VII Corps, Watts' XIX Corps (containing 66th Division now commanded by Neill Malcolm), Maxse's XVIII Corps and III Corps. The latter was commanded by Butler, recently removed as Deputy Chief of Staff BEF, and who had never before commanded a large formation in battle but was now holding the weakest part of the front. None of these corps had any division in reserve. After this inspection Haig released 39th Division (north of Peronne) to control of Fifth Army, and brought 50th Division, still in GHQ Reserve, down from Flanders to a point  west of St Quentin \u2013 given the 24 hours' notice required, it would take two and a half days to reach the front when needed. Gough also requested that men from 20th (still in GHQ Reserve behind his front) and 50th Divisions be used to help dig defences, but this was vetoed by GHQ.Farrar-Hockley 1975, pp. 263\u2013267", "After seeing Wynne's draft Gough (correspondence with Edmonds, 1944) claimed that Haig had been responsible for too narrow and weak an initial thrust and that Haig's \"personal explanations\" at the time urged Gough \"to capture the Passchendaele Ridge and advance as rapidly as possible on Roulers (if possible on the first day)\",Travers 1987, p. 212 which lay  behind the German front line [actually ] and thereafter on Ostend with the Fourth Army on the coast covering his left and \"very definitely ... an attempt to break through and moreover Haig never altered this opinion until the attack was launched as far as I know. He confirmed this general idea on several occasions.\"Travers 1987, pp. 207\u2013208 Gough also scoffed at the implication that Haig had disapproved of his breakthrough attempt but had done nothing to stop it, and that even the corps commanders had warned of Gough's mistakes. Edmonds blamed the influence of Tavish Davidson on Wynne. Neill Malcolm, formerly Gough's chief of staff, called the 1943 draft \"a farrago of malicious nonsense\" (he objected particularly to Wynne's suggestion that Gough was allowed both to execute his attacks as he saw fit and to dictate to his corps commanders, without interference from Haig)Green 2003, p. 177 and wrote that \"Haig decided that he wanted a breakthrough and Charteris was always telling him that the Germans were on the verge of cracking. The breakthrough was the policy.\"", "Some put the blame for Fifth Army's performance on Gough's Chief of Staff Neill Malcolm, although his overbearing behaviour with Gough's subordinates may have been, even in the view of contemporaries, a variant on the \"good-cop/bad-cop\" routine. Edmonds also wrote in his memoirs (which are somewhat less reliable than the Official History) that Malcolm \"accentuated and encouraged Gough's peculiarities, instead of softening them down\" and claimed that in late 1917 Peyton (Military Secretary) had warned Haig \"three times that he was not only injuring himself but also injuring the cause by keeping Gough in command\" but Haig was \"perfectly infatuated with him\". The situation worsened after Edward Beddington, who had been something of a buffer, left Fifth Army staff in 1917. Gough himself, in conversation with Liddell Hart and in The Fifth Army put some blame on Malcolm and also blamed himself for taking Malcolm with him on his inspection rounds, so that officers did not feel able to speak freely. However, Michael Howard, in his review of Farrar-Hockley's biography, commented that there was more to Fifth Army's \"malaise\" than just that. Sheffield points out that this does not seem to have been Gough's view during the war, and that Gough's problems began before Malcolm's arrival (e.g. at Loos) and continued after his removal.Sheffield & Todman 2004, p. 83 Watts of XIX Corps was the biggest victim of Malcolm.Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 228 Farrar-Hockley argues that Gough was a popular figure until Bullecourt.Farrar-Hockley 1974, pp. 198\u2013199, 206 Wilson's academic biographer Keith Jeffery describes Farrar-Hockley as \"an unconvincing defence\" of Gough.Jeffery 2006, p. 170"]}, {"page": "30th Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Major-General Neill Malcolm December 1918 \u2013 February 1919"]}, {"page": "Chatham House", "response": ["Chatham House held the first Commonwealth Relations Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1933.

Malcolm was a decorated veteran of several colonial wars, who had served in staff posts since being wounded in the Second Boer War and had most recently served as chief of staff of the Fifth Army. The division was reorganised over the winter, with the brigade machine-gun companies being consolidated into a battalion and a pioneer battalion, the 1/5th Border Regiment joining the division. The most substantial change was the loss of three battalions, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers and 2/8th and 2/10th Manchester Regiment, one from each brigade. This was a change made in all British divisions, to bring the remaining battalions in France up to strength and to increase the ratio of artillery to infantry.
