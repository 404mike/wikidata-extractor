The album was championed by BBC Radio 2 presenter Desmond Carrington.\nSubsequent releases have included Ukulele Mania (2004), We'll Meet Again (2005), Bring Me Sunshine (2007), and Ukulele Mania Bonus Edition (2009). In addition to the ukulele and banjolele, he plays violin, guitar, banjo, piano, keyboards, drums, bass, washboard, and of course, vocals, on his recordings.In 2008 Eastwood began presenting a music programme called Andy's Attic on the internet radio station Retro Jukebox, and in 2010 he released his first DVD, We'll Meet Again.Eastwood's TV appearances include Barrymore, Blue Peter, GMTV, Today with Des and Mel, and he also taught comedian Frank Skinner to play the ukulele for the 2006 BBC One show Play It Again. Skinner became so interested in the instrument that as a result he went on to make a George Formby documentary for BBC Four, in which Eastwood also appeared. A further Skinner documentary What A Performance in 2015 also featured Eastwood discussing George Formby and playing one of Formby's original instruments, which he now owns.\nEastwood continued his quest to demonstrate the ukulele's worth as a 'serious' instrument in 2015 with the release of Three Classics for Ukulele, a suite of classical pieces arranged as challenging instrumental solos.In 2016 he was voted into the showbusiness charity organisation The Grand Order of Water Rats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Banjo ukulele", "response": ["Recent users of the banjo ukulele have included Jeff Claus of The Horse Flies, Alan Randall, Andy Eastwood, comedian Frank Skinner, Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer, and Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar.
