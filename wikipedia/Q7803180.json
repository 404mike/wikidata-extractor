He argued against Thornhill and Palmer's suggestion that rape is an evolutionary adaptation, writing that, \"While one study found that women are 2.5 times more likely to become pregnant after rape than consensual sex, even when accounting for the use of contraception, the idea doesn't account for the rape of men or children.\""]}, {"page": "Birkhead", "response": ["*Tim Birkhead, Professor of Zoology at the University of Sheffield and author"]}, {"page": "Birds Britannia", "response": ["The series has no presenter, and is narrated by the Scottish actor Bill Paterson, with filmed interviews with a wide range of experts and bird enthusiasts, including David Attenborough, Mark Cocker, Jeremy Mynott, Tim Birkhead, Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall, Christopher Frayling, Kate Humble, Rob Lambert, Desmond Morris, David Lindo, Helen Macdonald, Andrew Motion, Tony Soper, and Bill Oddie."]}, {"page": "Robin Baker (biologist)", "response": ["To test this idea, reproductive biologist Harry Moore and evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead of the University of Sheffield mixed sperm samples from 15 men in various combinations and checked for how the cells moved, clumped together, or developed abnormal shapes. \"These are very simple experiments, but we tried to mimic what goes on in the reproductive tract,\" Moore says. The team found no excess casualties from any particular donor or other evidence of warring sperm, they report in 7 December Proceedings of the Royal Society. \"The kamikaze sperm hypothesis is probably not a mechanism in human sperm competition,\" says Birkhead."]}]}}
