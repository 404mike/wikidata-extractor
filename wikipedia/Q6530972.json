He played as a midfielder.\nLea began his professional career with Blackpool in 1960, making his debut in the opening game of the 1960\u201361 league campaign. He scored his first goal for the club in their fourth league game, a 3\u20131 defeat at Tottenham on 31 August 1960. He made six other league appearances that term, the last one being on 1 October, meaning he sat out the remaining six months of the season.\nHe didn't feature at all in 1961\u201362, but the following season, 1962\u201363, he featured in half of the league campaign. He also scored two goals, in consecutive games as the season drew to a close: firstly in a 3\u20132 victory over Arsenal at Bloomfield Road on 27 April 1963, and then in a 3\u20130 whitewash of Manchester City at Maine Road on 4 May.\nIn 1963\u201364, Lea made 30 league starts, scoring a solitary goal (in the final league game of the season).\nHe continued to be a regular fixture in Ron Suart's teams throughout 1964\u201365, making another 30 league appearances and scoring twice, both in victories: 4\u20132 at home to Blackburn Rovers on 24 August 1964, and 3\u20131 in Blackpool's hosting of Sunderland on 26 September. He also scored in their League Cup second round win against Newcastle three days earlier.\nLea's goals during the 1965\u201366 league season all came in victories once more: one in a 2\u20131 scoreline against Sheffield Wednesday on 27 November 1965; both goals in a 2\u20131 victory at Leeds United on 26 March 1966; and one in a 3\u20130 win at home over Northampton in the penultimate game of the league season. He scored in the League Cup for the second consecutive season, again in the second round, but this time in a 5\u20131 victory over Manchester United, with Ray Charnley netting a hat-trick. His goals could not save Blackpool from relegation, however, and they dropped into Division Two at the end of the season, four months after Ron Suart was replaced as manager by Stan Mortensen.\nLea's final appearance for Blackpool came eighteen games into the 1967\u201368 league calendar, a 2\u20130 defeat at home to Norwich City. Stan Mortensen, who had brought in Alan Skirton, sold him to Cardiff City for \u00a320,000. He went on to make 76 league appearances for the Bluebirds in three years, scoring seven goals.\nHe finished his playing career with Barnsley. In six years at Oakwell, he made over 200 league appearances and scored 32 goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lea (surname)", "response": ["* Leslie Lea, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Steve Hill (footballer)", "response": ["In 1962\u201363, Hill's appearances were limited due to injury.

Hearts finished seventh and 11th in the First Division in 1965\u201366 and 1966\u201367. He appeared in just six league games at Tynecastle, scoring one goal. In 1967, Sharp joined Carlisle United for a fee of \u00a3500, but struggled to hold down a regular first team place at Brunton Park. The \"Cumbrians\" finished mid-table in the Second Division in 1967\u201368 and 1968\u201369 under the stewardship of first Tim Ward and then Bob Stokoe. He then moved on to Jimmy Scoular's Second Division side Cardiff City. Plagued by injury, Sharp spent just over one season at Ninian Park, his only goal coming in a 1\u20131 draw with Hull City in March 1970, before he joined Barnsley along with Leslie Lea. Johnny Steele's \"Tykes\" finished 12th in the Third Division in 1970\u201371, before suffering relegation in 1971\u201372 under the stewardship of rookie manager John McSeveney. Johnny Steele then returned to Barnsley, and led the club to a 14th-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1972\u201373. Sharp scored seven goals in 125 league appearances at Oakwell. He then scored two goals in 29 Third Division games at Ron Ashman's Grimsby Town in the 1973\u201374 season. He left Blundell Park and joined Third Division side Port Vale in May 1974. He opened the 1974\u201375 season with a goal in each of his first two games at Vale Park, but lost his first team place in November and went to finish the season with 27 league and cup appearances. He was given a free transfer in May 1975 by \"Valiants\" manager Roy Sproson, and moved on to Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria."]}]}}
