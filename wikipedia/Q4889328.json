In 1798, when, in response to the Pinckney affair, a belligerent President Adams sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and Cooper saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: Maxims of political arithmetic, which attacked Adams, defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism.Signed \u2018A Quaker in politics,\u2019 the Maxims were printed over two days in the Aurora General Advertiser, 26 & 27 February 1798, and reprinted in both the Auroraand Carey's United States' Recorder, 31 March & 1 April 1799. See Rutt, XXV, 175-82. In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: \"Dr Priestley in America,\" was seized by the Royal Navy on board a neutral Danish boat. It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer John Hurford Stone. These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America.Copies of original letters recently written by persons in Paris to Dr. Priestley in America, taken on board of a neutral vessel (London, 1798).

One of the letters was addressed to \"MBP\", with a note: \"I inclose a note for our friend MBP\u2014but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must beg you to seal and address it.\" This gave the intercepted letters a tinge of intrigue. Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named \"MBP\" (Member of the British Parliament) as Mr. Benjamin Vaughan, who \"like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name.\"Vaughan had fled to France in May 1794, when John Hurford Stone's brother, William, was arrested and found to have a letter from Vaughan. In France, to avoid arrest as an Englishmen, he assumed the name of Jean Martin, and lived quietly at Passy. (John G. Alger, Englishmen in the French Revolution (London, 1889), 93).

When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from milk sickness or a bacterial infection, Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour.

Isaac Reed of Waldoboro, Maine, who purportedly wrote its official description and explanation. There have been variations in the details of the seal, but the overall design and images remain true to the original. The center of the seal is a shield adorned with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods; a pine tree stands tall directly behind the moose. On either side of the shield, a farmer rests on his scythe, and a sailor leans on an anchor. Above the shield is the motto \"Dirigo\" (I direct) and a stylized North Star. Below the shield is a banner that reads \"Maine\". The legislature of 1919 decided that the design of the seal should no longer vary, and the design is still used today.", "While the explanation of the seal is credited to Reed, the original first draft of the design is credited to Dr. Benjamin Vaughan from Hallowell, Maine.

August 10, 2020 Publishing numerous articles, Vaughan devoted his life to building mills, stores, printing-offices, breweries, and advocating toward the Settlement of Kennebec County. Drawing details from Reed's description, Vaughan submitted a preliminary sketch to the legislature sub-committee. The design was nearly unanimously rejected for various reasons: the moose looked \"more like a deer,\" and one committee member complained that his initial desire that the aurora borealis and a quote from St. Paul was not included. Despite the fact that a state seal was needed for immediate use on official documents, \u201cno part of it was very ingeniously wrought or executed; hence people of taste and judgment have not been altogether pleased with the devices, or emblems,\u201d says historian William D. Williamson.", "How it finally came to approval is unknown; but since that time, various stories, printed articles and even Maine towns have disputed authorship over the original sketch design. On June 12, 1820, The Portland Gazette reported: \"We understand that the emblems for the seal of the State were proposed by Benjamin Vaughan, Esq. of Hallowell, that the sketch was executed by a young lady in this town, and that the Motto, description, explanation, &c are from the pen of Col.

By the 1960s, Vaughan Road was closed before it could connect with Eglinton; an Esso gas station and parkette later occupied the former right of way and intersection, but demolished in the mid-2010s to accommodate Fairbank station of Line 5 Eglinton, scheduled to open in 2022. Vaughan Road was then extended north along what is now Dufferin Street into Vaughan Township, which later became the City of Vaughan.  Therefore, Vaughan Road is named after the township, which itself is named after Benjamin Vaughan, a British commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the United States in 1783. This road was popular with street racers in the 1950s due to its many curves from being parallel to a creek.
