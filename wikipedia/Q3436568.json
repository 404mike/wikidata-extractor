Young (director).Robert William Young (born 16 March 1933) is a British television and film director.\nYoung was born in Cheltenham, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, established himself as a leading director of British TV drama. In the 1970s, he directed Vampire Circus (1972), Soldier's Home (1977) and an episode of Hammer House of Horror. He directed several episodes of Minder and Bergerac in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial The Mad Death which centred on a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on Robin of Sherwood, for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes.\nYoung moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing Jeeves and Wooster based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and G.B.H., for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award. It was partly on the strength of GBH that he was assigned to direct Fierce Creatures, John Cleese's 1997 follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda, which featured many of the same cast as GBH. However, the production ran into problems and Fred Schepisi was brought in to finalise the movie.  Young did, however, direct Splitting Heirs, which starred Cleese and Eric Idle.\nYoung has continued to work on television drama since then.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Catherine Zeta-Jones", "response": ["Following a brief appearance as Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in Splitting Heirs (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews for the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times found her to be \"very funny\". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film The Return of the Native, an adaptation of the novel of the same name (1878) by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen's character in the television war drama The Cinder Path. She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic Catherine the Great. In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of Variety found the miniseries to be \"brightly colored\" but \"wooden and hollow\", though thought that Zeta-Jones \"imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making\".. She next appeared as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee's character in Blue Juice (1995), publicised as Britain's first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin described as a \"superficial and predictable\" production."]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Fierce Creatures || Universal Pictures || Fred Schepisi, Robert Young (director); John Cleese (screenplay); Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Robert Lindsay, Ronnie Corbett, Carey Lowell, Bille Brown, Derek Griffiths, Maria Aitken, Cynthia Cleese, Richard Ridings, Gareth Hunt || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1994 in film", "response": ["| That's Entertainment!

Preview audiences expressed dissatisfaction with the ending, and in February 1996 the decision was made to reshoot the ending and some other sequences. These additional scenes could not be shot until August 1996 because of the availability of the cast, in particular Michael Palin who was making Full Circle with Michael Palin. In the meantime, Cleese and Johnstone worked on a new ending with William Goldman. The delay meant that director Robert Young was busy on pre-production for Jane Eyre, so Cleese hired Fred Schepisi, with whom he had been discussing making a version of Don Quixote.
