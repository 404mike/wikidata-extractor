Despite his size \u2013 6 feet (1.83m) tall \u2013 he was very fast over short distances, a quality he used to his advantage when scoring many of his goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 18", "response": ["*  1951   \u2013 Bob Latchford, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.", "response": ["|2000||align=\"left\"|Bob Latchford||FW||1973\u201380||||286||138"]}, {"page": "Birmingham City F.C.", "response": ["Businessman Clifford Coombs took over as chairman in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which took them to the semifinals of the League Cup in 1967 and of the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of \u00a3350,000, but without his goals the team struggled. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of \u00a31\u00a0million; Francis had scored 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham."]}, {"page": "Swansea City A.F.C.", "response": ["The 1981\u201382 season began with the fixture computer handing Swansea a first-day home game against Leeds United, which the club promptly won 5\u20131 with a hat-trick by debutant Bob Latchford. Swansea had swept from the basement division to the top of the entire Football League in three years. Victories over Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur followed as the club topped the league on several further occasions.

It was Mariner, however, who would be selected the majority of the time."]}, {"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Bob Latchford \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "John Toshack", "response": ["After finishing mid-table in their first season in the Second Division, Swansea claimed a third promotion in four seasons in 1981 after beating Preston North End 3\u20131 on 2 May 1981 and won the Welsh Cup for the first time in fifteen years soon after by defeating Hereford United. After achieving promotion, Toshack's former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly heaped praise on his achievements, stating \"he's done a remarkable job, I would say he's possibly manager of the century.\" Once they reached the top flight, Swansea were predicted by many to be relegated, but in their first match in the First Division they claimed a 5\u20131 victory over Leeds United after a hat-trick from newly arrived club-record signing Bob Latchford. In recognition of his achievements at the club, Toshack was awarded an MBE midway through the season. Swansea topped the league at several stages of the season, leading the division with only three months remaining, but injuries to key-players Latchford and another former Liverpool teammate of Toshack's Ray Kennedy, saw a downturn in results and they won just one of their final six matches before finishing their first campaign in the top flight in sixth position. During this period, he was told by the Liverpool board that he was their choice to replace current manager Bob Paisley when he chose to retire. Toshack had openly coveted the position stating \"When I went to Swansea the thing I wanted in the long term was to end up at Liverpool\". However, Paisley remained longer than expected and the position eventually went to Joe Fagan. Swansea were relegated the following year as the club suffered financial difficulties after relatively big spending under Toshack's tenure and then suffered a second successive relegation. He resigned in October 1983 but returned eight weeks later, remaining with the club for a further three months before departing again in March 1984. The heavy spending during Toshack's years at Swansea were often cited as a key factor in the severe financial issues that affected the club, being issued with a winding up order due to unpaid debts in December 1985."]}]}}
