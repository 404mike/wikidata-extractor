Although both may seem identical, each has different techniques. Muay Thai originated in Thailand, and is known as the \"art of eight limbs\", which refers to the use of the legs, knees, elbows and fists. One of the primary benefits of training in Muay Thai for MMA is its versatility. Techniques cover the long, middle and short range with everything from kicks to clinch holds and throws. Meanwhile, kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat martial arts based on kicking and punching. The modern style originated in Japan, developed from Karate and Muay Thai, and had further development in the Netherlands and the United States. Different governing bodies apply different rules, such as allowing the use of elbows, knees, clinching or throws, etc. Notable fighters who use Muay Thai include former UFC women's strawweight champion Joanna J\u0119drzejczyk, UFC Featherweight Edson Barboza UFC Middleweight Darren Till and former UFC champions Zhang Weili, Anderson Silva, Jos\u00e9 Aldo and Cris Cyborg, while some kickboxers in MMA include Mirko Cro Cop, Alistair Overeem, Israel Adesanya, Sean O'Malley, Michael Page, Cory Sandhagen, and Bas Rutten.", "Wushu Sanshou and other Chinese martial arts have also been utilized in MMA. They can be highly effective in competition due to their mixture of striking and takedowns, achieved through a condensation of traditional Chinese martial arts techniques. Most prominent and chief amongst these fighters is Cung Le, who is most notable for his TKO and KO victories over former UFC champions Frank Shamrock (in Strikeforce) and Rich Franklin (at UFC Macau). Other Wushu Sanshou based fighters who have entered MMA include former UFC strawweight champion Zhang Weili, Cung Le, Michael Page, KJ Noons, Pat Barry, Zhang Tiequan, Muslim Salihov,  and Zabit Magomedsharipov."]}, {"page": "MVP (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Michael Page, professional boxer and mixed martial artist, nicknamed \"MVP\" (Michael Venom Page)"]}, {"page": "Bellator MMA", "response": ["Bellator's first event was held in 2009, and the promotion has since held over 200 \"numbered\" events as of December 2019.
