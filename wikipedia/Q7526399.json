Allowances vary in different places, possibly according to the alleged efficiency of the animals and other factors. It has proved impossible to organise any scheme for payment by results or output bonus ... there has been a general wage freeze since July 1918, but there have been no complaints!\"Gammans was made a baronet, of Hornsey in the County of Middlesex on 24 January 1956. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir David Gammans, 1st Baronet; MP for Hornsey (1941\u20131957)"]}]}}
