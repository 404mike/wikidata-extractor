He was the 1978 league leading scorer and MVP.\nIn 1974, he signed for Northwich Victoria from Buxton. In his first season for Northwich, he scored 45 goals in 56 games; only two other Northwich players have better records in the club's history. However the lure of the growing football scene in the USA saw him sign for the Los Angeles Skyhawks in the American Soccer League. Despite being on the LA Skyhawks' books, he returned to Northwich in 1976, scoring a vital goal in the club's best modern-time FA Cup run.In the same season, his team, LA Skyhawks won the league championship and Rolland was the team and league's second leading scorer. In 1978, he led the league with 17 goals in 24 games, leading to his selection as league MVP.In 1980 he was contracted to play with ASL expansion team the Phoenix Fire, but the team folded in pre-season.In 1980, he played for the California Sunshine.He then played for the San Francisco Fog during the 1980-1981 Major Indoor Soccer League season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Los Angeles Skyhawks", "response": ["The Skyhawks managed to obtain the services of the renowned Ron Newman as their head coach, and he assembled a roster consisting of a number of young players from England's second and third divisions. Many of these players also had some limited first division experience; players such as goalkeeper Brian Parkinson (Everton), Midfielder Tony \"Wheels\" Whelan (Manchester City), Jimmy Rolland (Northwich Victoria), and forward Jimmy \"the Price\" Hinch (York), were the stars of the team. In addition, U.S. college player of the year Steve Ralbovsky (Brown University) spurned the N.A.S.L. and signed with the Skyhawks. The defense was anchored by 38-year-old sweeper and former Scottish International Ron Yeats (\"the Colussus\"), a veteran of the English First Division, where he was Liverpool's captain when Liverpool rose to glory in the 1960s. Hinch ended up as the A.S.L.'s leading scorer and Parkinson had the lowest goals against average (0.78) among A.S.L. goalkeepers. Led by these stars and a strong supporting cast, the Skyhawks had the league's best record (13 wins, 6 draws, 2 defeats) and regularly drew upwards of 4,000 fans per game, easily leading the ASL in attendance.", "After earning a first round bye, the Skyhawks faced the 2nd place Tacoma Tides, who had defeated Utah 2\u20131 in the first round. The Skyhawks took a 1\u20130 lead, but midway through the second half, goalkeeper Brian Parkinson suffered a head injury in a collision, and Tacoma equalized against backup keeper Marine Cano to force overtime. Facing the prospect of going into a penalty kick shootout without their #1 keeper, the Skyhawks won the game in the second 10-minute overtime period on a goal by Jimmy Rolland.", "The Skyhawks were again led offensively by Jimmy Hinch and Jimmy Rolland (who finished 2nd and 3rd in the league in scoring) and in goal by Brian Parkinson (who finished 2nd in GAA). While they couldn't duplicate their dominance of the 1976 season, they finished 2nd in the West and 4th overall with 13 wins, 4 draws, and 7 defeats. After a 3-2 first round playoff win over the California Sunshine, they lost to Western Division champion Sacramento in the Western Division playoff finals, 2\u20131.", "By 1978, the ASL was in severe financial difficulty, with every team losing money. On the field, the Skyhawks, led by ASL leading scorer and MVP Jimmy Rolland and goalkeeper Brian Parkinson (again 2nd in GAA), returned to the top of the Western Division and with a record of 17-6-1. They made it to the championship game for the 2nd time in 3 years, but lost in the final, 1\u20130 to the New York Apollo, who had the league's best record at 18-5-1.", "* 1978: Jimmy Rolland", "* 1978: Jimmy Rolland", "* The Skyhawks played a friendly in March 1979 against the 1980 US Olympic team at Jackie Robinson stadium losing the match 2\u20131.
