The entire defence of Jack Wheeler, Ron Staniforth, Laurie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Don McEvoy and Len Quested played in every fixture, as did winger Vic Metcalfe, while 30-goal top scoring centre forward Jimmy Glazzard missed only one match as Town gained an immediate return to the top flight."]}, {"page": "Andrew Beattie", "response": ["*Andy Beattie (1913\u20131983), Scottish footballer", "*Andy Beattie (rugby union) (born 1978), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Hampton School", "response": ["* Andy Beattie, rugby player", "* Andy Beattie \u2013 former rugby union player for Exeter Chiefs and Bath Rugby and current coach of the school's 1XV team."]}, {"page": "The Mall School", "response": ["*Andy Beattie, former rugby player, Bath Rugby Club and England national rugby union team"]}, {"page": "Andy Beattie (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Beattie (rugby union)"]}]}}
