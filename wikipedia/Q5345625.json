Initial work included rearranging and displaying the museum's collection of medieval pilgrims' badges. Soon, however, he was introduced to what would be later termed rescue archaeology, when a group of seventeenth-century houses gave way to a large extension to the Bodleian Library. Before the demolition, Bodley's Librarian invited the Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society \"to investigate and record any features of architectural or antiquarian interest which are contained in the block of houses ... and also to watch for any finds that may turn up during the demolition of these houses and the subsequent excavations for the foundations of the new building\". The Society, in turn, created a subcommittee consisting of E. T. Long, Edward Thurlow Leeds, and William Abel Pantin, the latter of whom wrote an article on the houses and commented on the \"practical consideration or morals to be drawn\" from their destruction."]}, {"page": "List of Old Uppinghamians", "response": ["* Edward Thurlow Leeds, archaeologist, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum 19281945"]}, {"page": "Burial in Anglo-Saxon England", "response": ["Cemeteries of this period have sometimes been referred to as \"Final Phase\", a term coined for them by the archaeologist Edward Thurlow Leeds in 1936. He viewed such cemeteries as the last manifestation of the pagan way of life before it was supplanted by Christianity with its unfurnished burial practices. In 1963, the archaeologist Miranda Hyslop analyzed the excavated burials up to that date and assembled a list of attributes that she believed defined Final Phase burials. The furnished burials of the \"Final Phase\" are typical of 7th and early-8th century cemeteries. However, the manner in which archaeologists have assigned burials as \"Final Phase\" has been uneven, and thus there is no clear corpus of agreed-upon examples."]}, {"page": "Edward Leeds", "response": ["*Edward Thurlow Leeds (1877\u20131955), English archaeologist"]}, {"page": "ET Leeds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Thurlow Leeds"]}, {"page": "E.T.

The 1923 excavation was overseen by Bowles, although actually carried out by a Tom Arnold and five helpers. Bowles was also aided by Edward Thurlow Leeds, then assistant keeper at the University of Oxford's Ashmolean Museum; Leeds offered suggestions, visited the site, and published the main discoveries. He published the 1923 excavation along with an excavation plot by Bowls in The Antiquaries Journal in April 1924, and briefly discussed the 1924 excavation 15 years later in a chapter of A History of Oxfordshire.
