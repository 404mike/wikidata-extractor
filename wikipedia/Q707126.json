During the winter of 1816\u20131817 he was at Naples, and was so keenly interested in Vesuvius that he renewed his studies of the volcano in 1818; and in the following year visited Etna and the Lipari Islands. In 1821 he married the daughter and heiress of William Scrope of Castle Combe, Wiltshire, and assumed her name; and he entered the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1833 as MP for Stroud, retaining his seat until 1868.\nMeanwhile he began to study the volcanic regions of central France in 1821, and visited the Eifel district in 1823. In 1825 he published Considerations on Volcanos, leading to the establishment of a new theory of the Earth, and in the following year was elected FRS. This earlier work was subsequently amplified and issued under the title of Volcanos (1862); an authoritative text-book of which a second edition was published ten years later. In 1827 he issued his classic Memoir on the Geology of Central France, including the Volcanic formations of Auvergne, the Velay and the Vivarais, a quarto volume illustrated by maps and plates. The substance of this was reproduced in a revised and somewhat more popular form in The Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France (1858).  These books were the first widely published descriptions of the Cha\u00eene des Puys, a chain of over 70 small volcanoes in the Massif Central.\nScrope was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1867. Among his other works was the History of the Manor and Ancient Barony of Castle Combe (printed for private circulation, 1852).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Babbage", "response": ["It has been written that \"what Arthur Young was to agriculture, Charles Babbage was to the factory visit and machinery\". Babbage's theories are said to have influenced the layout of the 1851 Great Exhibition, and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary George Julius Poulett Scrope. Karl Marx argued that the source of the productivity of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery, building on Adam Smith, Babbage and Ure. Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer: as Babbage did, he wrote that it was for the sake of profitability, rather than productivity, and identified an impact on the concept of a trade."]}, {"page": "1797", "response": ["** George Julius Poulett Scrope, English geologist, political economist and magistrate (d. 1876)"]}, {"page": "List of geologists", "response": ["* George Julius Poulett Scrope (1797\u20131876), English, volcanology, Wollaston Medal"]}, {"page": "1876 in literature", "response": ["*January 19 \u2013 George Julius Poulett Scrope, English political economist (born 1797)"]}, {"page": "Volcanology", "response": ["*George Julius Poulett Scrope (1797\u20131876)"]}, {"page": "Volcanologist", "response": ["*George Julius Poulett Scrope (1797\u20131876)"]}, {"page": "George Poulett Scrope", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Julius Poulett Scrope"]}, {"page": "Maar", "response": ["*  In 1825, George Julius Poulett Scrope (1797\u20131876) introduced the term \"maar\" into English.

The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes with pyroclastic surges. The amount of magma erupted can be so large that it depletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse, resulting in a caldera. Fine ash and pulverized pumice can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud noises, such as those generated by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The sudden discharge of electrical charges accumulated in the air around the ascending column of volcanic ashes also often causes lightning strikes as depicted by the English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope in his painting of 1822."]}, {"page": "Scrope", "response": ["* George Julius Poulett Scrope, History of the Manor and Ancient Barony of Castle Combe, Wiltshire (London. 1852)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*George Julius Poulett Scrope (1797\u20131876), English geologist"]}, {"page": "Dasymetric map", "response": ["The earliest maps using this kind of approach include an 1833 map of world population density by George Julius Poulett Scrope and an 1838 map of population density in Ireland by Henry Drury Harness, although the methods used to create these maps were never documented."]}, {"page": "George Scrope", "response": ["#redirect George Julius Poulett Scrope"]}, {"page": "John Clarke (dean of Salisbury)", "response": ["Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham and George Julius Poulett Scrope, sons of Charlotte Thomson n\u00e9e Jacob, Clarke's granddaughter."]}, {"page": "1797 in Great Britain", "response": ["** George Julius Poulett Scrope, geologist, political economist and magistrate (died 1876)"]}, {"page": "Cha\u00eene des Puys", "response": ["The chain was the subject of the pioneering research of English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope, starting in the 1820s.
