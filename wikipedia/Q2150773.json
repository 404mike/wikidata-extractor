While at the University of Edinburgh, he himself gave most of the systematic lectures in Medicine and also made his lectures notes available to students as typewritten notes. It was these notes which formed the basis of the textbook, \"Principles and Practices of Medicine\", that he published in 1952. He has been a teacher to many well known doctors including John George Macleod, Professor Ronald Haxton Girdwood, a hematologist who discovered the link between folate deficiency and Megaloblastic anemia, Sir John McMichael, a  pioneer in the field of Cardiology whose works formed the basis of success in the treatment of cardiac diseases in Britain, and Harold Thomas Swan, who discovered and published two important case-notes recording the successful clinical use of penicillin in 1930."]}]}}
