Pinton refused to sell to an MLS team, believing that the league would not acknowledge the Cosmos' legacy. However, when old NASL names such as the San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps were revived as MLS franchises, he reconsidered. He sold the Cosmos name and brand to English businessman Paul Kemsley in 2009, whose group announced a new team with the Cosmos' name in August 2010. The new Cosmos initially intended to become an MLS expansion franchise, but ultimately turned down the invitation to apply.

Filming began later that year in Autumn, with the first task seeing the men name their team Invicta, while the women named their team Velocity.
