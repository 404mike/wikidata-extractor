Before the committee of 1832 Tooke stated that, according to his experience, a rise or fall of prices had invariably preceded, and could not therefore be caused by, an enlargement or contraction of the circulation. This view, while inconsistent with the quantity theory of money, is consistent with the real bills doctrine. On this view, a fall in the value of the assets of a money-issuing bank would cause the value of the bank's notes to fall. The public would then require more notes to conduct business, and the bank would willingly issue those notes to customers who offered assets of adequate value in exchange. Thus the quantity of notes would increase after the price level had risen."]}, {"page": "John Fullarton", "response": ["John Fullarton (c.1645 \u2013 1727), of Greenhall, Argyll, was a Scottish clergyman and nonjurant Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh between 1720 and 1727.", "John Fullarton was consecrated a college bishop by the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Bishop of Edinburgh and Bishop of Dunblane on 25 January 1705 and was elected Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus in April 1720, with limited metropolitan powers, following the death of Dr Alexander Rose.

The school arose in opposition to the British Currency School; they argued that currency issue could be naturally restricted by the desire of bank depositors to redeem their notes for gold. According to Jacob Viner the main members of the Banking School were Thomas Tooke, John Fullarton, James Wilson, and J. W. Gilbart. They believed \"The amount of paper notes in circulation was adequately controlled by the ordinary processes of competitive banking, and if the requirement of convertibility was maintained, could not exceed the needs of business for any appreciable length of time\".  Thus they opposed the requirement in the Bank Act of 1844 for a reserve requirement on banknotes."]}, {"page": "Fullarton (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Fullarton (c.1645 \u2013 1727), Scottish clergyman and nonjurant Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh", "* John Fullarton (writer) (c. 1780 \u2013 1849), Scottish traveller and writer"]}]}}
