As well as representing England, he has played in the Premier League for Manchester City, Chelsea, Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion, and he has also played for Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Trabzonspor.\nSturridge spent four years in the Aston Villa academy before moving to Coventry City. He then signed for Manchester City in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two FA Youth Cup finals. He made his first-team debut in the 2007\u201308 season, becoming the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 and signed for Chelsea, where he was loaned out to Bolton Wanderers for the second half of the 2010\u201311 season. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the 2011\u201312 season.\nHe left Chelsea to join Liverpool in January 2013, where he formed an attacking partnership with Luis Su\u00e1rez dubbed 'SAS'. Liverpool scored more than 100 league goals in the 2013\u201314 season with Sturridge scoring 21 goals, behind only Su\u00e1rez with 34. The following two seasons were curtailed by a myriad of injuries, limiting Sturridge to very few appearances. During those years, he scored the opening goal in the 2016 Europa League final, although Liverpool eventually lost the game to Sevilla. He featured most often as a substitute in the next seasons under manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, but was part of the UEFA Champions League-winning squad in 2019. Released days later, he signed for Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Trabzonspor, where his contract was terminated in March 2020 shortly before he received a four-month worldwide ban for breaching betting rules.Sturridge has represented England at all levels. He made 15 appearances and scored four goals for the under-21 team. He made his debut for England against Sweden on 15 November 2011 and was selected for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 1", "response": ["*  1989   \u2013 Daniel Sturridge, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1989", "response": ["** Daniel Sturridge, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Wayne Rooney", "response": ["At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Rooney started in England's first group match against Italy, setting up Daniel Sturridge's temporary equaliser, in a 2\u20131 loss.
