He was educated at Huddersfield College and entered the family worsted spinning business of D Illingworth & Sons at the age of 16. In 1865, with his brother Henry, he established the Whetley Mills, one of the largest factories in Bradford. He was also a director of the Bradford District Bank. He had strong non-conformist and free trade views and entered into politics.At the 1868 general election, Illingworth  was elected MP for  Knaresborough, but lost the seat in 1874. He was then elected at Bradford at the 1880 general election until the constituency was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. At the 1885 general election  he was elected for Bradford West and held the seat until 1895.\nHe received the freedom of the city of Bradford on 24 October 1902, \u2033for eminent service rendered to the city during his career\u2033.Illingworth married Margaret Holden, daughter of Sir Isaac Holden, 1st Baronet in 1863 and his brother Henry married another daughter of Holden creating a strong alliance of two of the dominant Bradford families of the time. Henry was the father of Percy Illingworth and Albert Illingworth who were also active in politics in Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isaac Holden", "response": ["His daughter Margaret had married Alfred Illingworth who succeeded him as MP for Knaresborough."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1885 || Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Frederick Illingworth", "response": ["*Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Illingworth", "response": ["*Alfred Illingworth (1827\u20131907), English worsted spinner and politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Bradford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Alfred Illingworth || Liberal "]}, {"page": "Spen Valley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["While originally devised by the Boundary Commissioners in 1885, the division was originally named as 'Birstal', \"from the name of a large ancient parish\".\"County of York (Eastern Division of the West Riding)\" in \"Report of the Boundary Commissioners for England Wales, 1885\" (C.-4287), vol I p. 185-7. The naming of the new division led to a small struggle between the two Houses of Parliament during the passage of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, when Alfred Illingworth (Liberal MP for Bradford) moved an amendment to replace 'Birstal' with 'Spen Valley'. Illingworth argued that Birstall contained only one-eighth of the population of the division, but Spen Valley was a name which represented several important towns, and his amendment was accepted without dissent by the House of Commons.Hansard 3ser vol 296 col 1937. When the Bill reached the House of Lords, the Conservative peer the Earl of Feversham moved an amendment to reinstate 'Birstal' claiming the support of the people in the area. The Earl contended that the Spen Valley was an unknown description and \"was only remarkable for being the receptacle of all the sewage from Birstal\", whereas Birstal was a very important parish. He had support from the Earl of Cranbrook and his amendment was also accepted without dissent.Hansard 3ser vol 298 col 1394.", "When the Bill returned to the House of Commons, Alfred Illingworth again took up the issue and moved that the Commons disagree with the Lords. He again pointed to the small population of Birstall in comparison with other towns, and noted that the Sanitary district covering the area was known as Spen Valley and that the River Spen ran through the centre of the constituency whereas Birstall was in the extreme north-east corner of it. Conservative MP Edward Stanhope (Mid Lincolnshire) said that he had found feeling in the area to be in favour of 'Birstal', but the President of the Local Government Board Sir Charles Dilke, speaking for the Government, stated that the local boards in Heckmondwike, Liversedge and Cleckheaton (where a majority of the population lived) had sent a memorial in favour of 'Spen Valley'. He agreed that the name had been invented by the Local Government Board, but argued that there were \"local jealousies\" between the towns and that Birstall was unpopular with the others, and therefore personally supported 'Spen Valley'. After a brief debate, the House voted by 65 to 46 to insist on 'Spen Valley' as the name.Hansard, 3ser vol 298 cols 1581-2. The Lords then gave way, but not without further protest from the Earl of Feversham.Hansard 3ser vol 298 cols 1610-11."]}, {"page": "Knaresborough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Illingworth"]}, {"page": "Joseph Craven (politician)", "response": ["It was his vote rather than his voice that Craven brought to the Commons debating chamber. He almost invariably supported the policies and positions adopted by Gladstone but had the reputation of voting out of conviction rather than simple loyalty, requiring persuasion on every issue. He was always eager to obtain personal insight into matters and in this respect often worked closely with his fellow West Riding MPs Alfred Illingworth and Briggs Priestley: with them he made fact-finding tours of Ireland in 1887Freeman\u2019s Journal, 18 November 1887. and South Africa in 1889,The Scotsman, 30 October 1889. and with Priestley he had visited India in 1885.Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale Herald, 5 December 1885.
