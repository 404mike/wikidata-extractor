Influenced by Gertrude Jekyll she created the noted garden at the house, with an inspired kind of untidiness that influenced her lifelong friend Vita Sackville-West's love of self-seeded surprise effects within a formal structure at Sissinghurst and that may be detected today in the garden style of Rosemary Verey. The writings of Gertrude Jekyll and the early champion of wild gardens William Robinson, she had no formal botanical training, but a highly developed 'garden sense' that was in part the inheritance of her class. In 1924 after the collapse of her marriage and facing financial ruin she embarked on a career as a garden designer. Lindsay spent her entire life socialising with the upper echelons of society.

Verey's biographer, Barbara Paul Robinson, felt that working for John with his large annual expenditure on Woodside was a welcome change for her since she had become used to clients who complained about costs. After being contacted by John's personal assistant in 1987, Verey recalled the name 'Woodside' from Robins's 18th-century paintings of the Rococo garden, and found a limited edition of a book featuring the paintings, which she presented to John. Verey was asked for a detailed garden plan for Woodside at short notice in 1988, and enlisted the help of Taylor and Cooper as she had no garden staff of her own. She described herself as an 'advisor' on the garden project, which involved detailed minuted meetings with landscape designers, architects and full-time gardeners. A water garden at Woodside with spouting fountains, large 'overflowing' flowering pots and scented borders was inspired by the Generalife gardens of the Alhambra in Granada.
