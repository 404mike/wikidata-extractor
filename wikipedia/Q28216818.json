He ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters in London between 2006 and 2009. In 2009, he co-founded Orbis Business Intelligence, a London-based private intelligence firm.\nSteele became the center of controversy after he authored a dossier for multiple clients, including an attorney associated with the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. The dossier claims, based on anonymous sources, Russia collected a file of compromising information on Donald Trump.Trump and his allies have falsely claimed the U.S. intelligence community probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election were launched due to Steele's dossier. The Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee concluded in an April 2018 report that the probe had been triggered by previous information from Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, and the February 2018 Nunes memo, written by staff members for that committee, reached the same conclusion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McCain", "response": ["In November 2016, McCain learned of the existence of a dossier regarding the Trump presidential campaign's links to Russia compiled by Christopher Steele.

In July 2020, Justice Mark Warby from the Queen's Bench Division of the British High Court of Justice ordered Orbis pay $23,000 to both Fridman and Aven in damages, after Steele claimed they had delivered \"large amounts of illicit cash\" to Vladimir Putin when Putin was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Judge Warby stated that the claim was \"demonstrably false\" and awarded the damages to compensate \"for the loss of autonomy, distress and reputational damage caused by the breaches of duty\". The judge stated that Steele's dossier also inaccurately claimed that Aven and Fridman provided foreign policy advice to Putin.
