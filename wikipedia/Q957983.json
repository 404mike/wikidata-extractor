Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 James Dewar and John Gray McKendrick documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits' blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to \"ozonized air\", which \"exercised a destructive action\". Sch\u00f6nbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the mucous membranes and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died. In 1911, Leonard Hill and Martin Flack stated in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B that ozone's healthful effects \"have, by mere iteration, become part and parcel of common belief; and yet exact physiological evidence in favour of its good effects has been hitherto almost entirely wanting\u00a0... The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and \u0153dema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time.\""]}, {"page": "Heart", "response": ["Although Purkinje fibers and the bundle of His were discovered as early as the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des S\u00e4ugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later.

Despite having written a letter to The Lancet about his failure to locate the Bundle of His and his increasing doubts about its existence, Keith (with his student Martin Flack) later reported that they had succeeded in locating the structure by following the detailed descriptions and figures in Tawara's monograph.
