Haworth was by now building a team not just to gain promotion but to secure the club's place in the top division and, having already recruited Tommy Boyle from Barnsley the previous year to strengthen the defence, he signed winger Eddie Mosscrop in September 1912, followed by the signing of three players from Gainsborough Trinity in February (following an F.A. Cup tie between the two clubs), including goalkeeper Ronnie Sewell. These players were to form the core of the Burnley side over the next few years and all were future England internationals. By mid-February, Burnley were top of the table and Freeman scored twice to defeat First Division Middlesbrough in the third round of the cup to set up a tie at local rivals Blackburn Rovers, where a single goal from Boyle saw them through to a semi-final against Sunderland. A 0\u20130 draw on 29 March at Bramall Lane preceded a replay at St Andrew's which saw Burnley lose 3\u20132. The FA Cup run had distracted Burnley from the league, and they had slipped into second place. They were able to hold onto the runners-up position and Freeman was again the league's top scorer with 31 goals from 37 appearances as Burnley eventually secured their return to the top flight after an absence of 13 years, finishing second in the table behind Preston North End. The success of Freeman and Burnley led to calls for him to be selected again for England, but these were ignored by the England selectors who opted for George Elliott and then Harry Hampton at centre-forward, and Freeman's England career ended with three goals in five appearances of which four were won with one draw."]}, {"page": "NASCAR Sportsman Division (1989\u20131995)", "response": ["In one race, Red Everette was t-boned by Ronnie Sewell.
