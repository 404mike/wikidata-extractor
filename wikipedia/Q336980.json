Many peers hold titles in several of these and repeating all the parameters (predecessor, successor, years and possibly more) simply because each title requires a special header does not make sense. If there is a need to specify that the title belongs to, say, the peerage of Scotland, that can easily be achieved within :Template:S-ttl. Can we get a header that says just \"Peerage titles\"? That would give us a more reasonable solution for cases such as Charles Gordon-Lennox, 10th Duke of Richmond. Pinging Mr. Stradivarius...
