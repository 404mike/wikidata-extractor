The philanthropist, politician, and evangelist Lord Shaftesbury even went so far as to describe Booth as the \"Anti-Christ\". One of the main complaints against Booth was his \"elevation of women to man's status\". Many found him dictatorial and hard to work with. Some of his own children denounced him as their leader and turned their backs on The Salvation Army, including his daughter Kate Booth and his sons Herbert and Ballington Booth, the latter founding a separate organisation, the Volunteers of America with himself as \"General\". The evangelist Rodney \"Gipsy\" Smith left him because of his rigidity and D.\u00a0L. Moody would not support him because he felt there was a threat to the local church. But no one could deny his compassion for the sufferings of his fellow man.William Booth: His Life and Ministry, the Gospel Truth website", "*Kate Booth (18 September 18589 May 1955)"]}, {"page": "Catherine Booth", "response": ["The Booths had eight children: Bramwell Booth,  Ballington Booth, Kate Booth, Emma Booth, Herbert Booth, Marie Booth, Evangeline Booth and Lucy Booth, and were dedicated to giving them a firm Christian knowledge.
