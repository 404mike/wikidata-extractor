Much to the annoyance of the BBC TV producer and director Paul Ciani, Roger, who was booked to play in the musical\u2019s band at the same time, was unable to fly to BBC Scotland in Glasgow to record the theme song to a new BBC1 TV series that Paul was producing called \u201cCrazy Bus\u201d, starring the comedians Hope & Keen, Peter Goodwright and Ruth Kettlewell. Having calmed down, Paul asked if he could come and see the musical.  As a direct result, \u201cSmike\u201d was scheduled in an hour-long potted version for transmission on BBC2 on Christmas Sunday 1973. The TV production starred Beryl Reid as Mrs Squeers, Andrew Keir as Mr Squeers, Leonard Whiting as Nicholas, Christine McKenna (probably best known for her starring role as \"Christina\" in 13 episodes of Flambards  in 1979)and Ian Sharrock (played \u201cJackie Merrick\u201d for nine years from 1980 in Emmerdale) as Smike. The original cast also featured DJ Neil Fox, a pupil at Kingston Grammar at the time, as one of the schoolboys.  The musical was repeated as \u201cShow Of The Week\u201d on BBC2 in April 1974 and repeated for a third time on BBC1 TV on Christmas Sunday 1974. In the forty-five plus years since then, the musical has enjoyed over 5,000 performances in schools and by amateur groups worldwide.  Two songs from the musical became hits in the UK \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ll Find Our Day\u201d sung by Stephanie de Sykes and \u201cDon\u2019t Let Life Get You Down\u201d by former Four Pennies lead singer, Lionel Morton.", "Another lucky break came in 1974 when, late on a Friday evening, Roger was the only writer in the offices of ATV Music when Len Beadle, the general manager, urgently required a song for Jack Barton, the producer of the ITV soap, Crossroads, who was sitting in his office. Roger suggested his composition \u201cBorn With A Smile On My Face\u201d (a song written for, and rejected, by Jimmy Tarbuck as the theme of the comedian\u2019s new TV series).  The song was hastily recorded by Stephanie de Sykes a week later at the ATV studios in Birmingham and, within three weeks, was number two in the official BBC charts."]}]}}
