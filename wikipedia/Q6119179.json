The refurbishment involved changing the building to an open plan layout so that 2,000 employees could be accommodated rather than 500 employees as previously. The scheme also involved moving the council chamber to the centre of the building with a new caf\u00e9 and other public space forming an arc round the council chamber and introduced energy efficiency measures such as a hydroelectric power plant and photo-voltaic panels.
