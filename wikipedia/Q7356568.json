He served in the Army for five years during World War II, reaching the rank of captain. He was a barrister and became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1952.\nAt the 1945 general election, Bowen was elected at the first attempt as Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire, succeeding Owen Evans. With only a Labour opponent he comfortably held the seat. He was re-elected in the 1950 general election with the largest Liberal majority at that election, despite facing both Conservative and Labour opposition. During most of the 1950s he was one of a tiny group of only five or six Liberal MPs left at Westminster. He failed to succeed Clement Davies as leader of the Liberal Party in 1956 when Jo Grimond was chosen. Politically, he was on the right of the Liberal Party. During the Suez Crisis, he defended the Conservative Government against opposition \"carping criticisms\". One of the chief opposition critics of the Government over Suez was his own party leader, Jo Grimond.\nSafely returned at the 1959 general election, Bowen's seat was regarded as \"the most secure Liberal seat in the whole of the United Kingdom\". Even so, it was widely believed that Bowen saw his political career as secondary to his work as a lawyer, a belief that was strengthened by his appointment as Recorder of Cardiff in 1950 and Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil in 1953. His legal work in south Wales resulted in very infrequent appearances in the constituency and his attendance and voting record at Westminster was sporadic.Bowen's political career came second to his judicial career although he was a President of the Welsh Liberal Federation and member of its council. He was Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil and of Carmarthen. After the 1964 election when Labour's majority in the House of Commons was just four seats, he was persuaded by the Government to accept the position of Deputy Speaker. This put the Labour majority in the House up to five.\nHis seat remained safe until the 1964 election when a Conservative candidate intervened and Labour cut his majority to around 2,000. At the 1966 general election, he was defeated by the Labour candidate by just 523 votes.\nHe served as National Insurance Commissioner for Wales, 1967\u201386, and as president of St Davids University College, Lampeter, 1977\u201392. One of the libraries and a research centre at Lampeter carry his name and Roderick Bowen is also the name of one of the student halls of residence. In 1971-72 he chaired a governmental committee set up to examine road signs policy in Wales.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*Roderic Bowen, Liberal MP, Deputy Commons Speaker"]}, {"page": "University of Wales, Lampeter", "response": ["The Roderic Bowen Research Centre, completed 2007 and named after Roderic Bowen, a former president of the university, houses the Founders' Library collection and archives and adjoins the main library building.

Thus he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan (1974\u20131983) and Ceredigion and Pembroke North (1983\u20131992) after boundary changes.

Evans died shortly before the 1945 general election, but the seat was easily held by his successor Roderic Bowen. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.", "With a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the Speaker in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the 1966 election, Labour selected Elystan Morgan who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.", "| Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Liberal Association", "response": ["*Roderic Bowen, CULC member, Liberal MP for Cardigan, 1945\u20131966"]}, {"page": "Chairman of Ways and Means", "response": ["| Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "2001 in Wales", "response": ["*19 July - Roderic Bowen, MP, 87"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* Roderic Bowen, Cardiganshire, 1945\u201366"]}, {"page": "1950 in Wales", "response": ["**Roderic Bowen is re-elected for Cardiganshire, with the largest Liberal majority in the country."]}, {"page": "Evan Roderic Bowen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roderic Bowen"]}, {"page": "Welsh Liberal Democrats", "response": ["In 1945 the party had 7 MPs in Wales, mainly in the Welsh-speaking north, mid and west Wales seats. Two of these MPs Gwilym Lloyd George (Pembrokeshire) and Megan Lloyd George (Anglesey)) defected to the Conservative and Labour parties, respectively. Clement Davies, who held Montgomeryshire, became the post-war British Liberal leader. Davies died in 1962 and was succeeded by Emlyn Hooson, who then set about rebuilding the Welsh Liberal Party. When the last of the post-war Welsh Liberal MPs, Roderic Bowen (Cardiganshire), lost his seat in the 1966 general election Hooson, Lord Ogmore, Martin Thomas (Lord Thomas of Gresford), Roger Roberts (Lord Roberts of Llandudno) and Mary Murphy established the Welsh Liberal Party as a separate state party within the Liberal Party's federal structure. After its establishment in September 1966 the Liberal Party in Wales had limited success and never really enjoyed a great Liberal revival like that which had occurred under Jo Grimond in Scotland. Geraint Howells' election in Cardiganshire in February 1974 re-established the Liberal presence in that seat. In 1979, however, the Welsh Liberals suffered from the Lib-Lab pact, and support for the failed devolution referendum resulted in a poor election for the Liberals: over half of their 28 candidates lost their deposit. More importantly Emlyn Hooson lost his Montgomeryshire seat, leaving the Welsh party once more with a single seat (Howells' in Cardiganshire). Hooson was ennobled later that year and joined Howells once more at Westminster."]}, {"page": "Emrys Roberts", "response": ["The immediate post-war period continued to be difficult for the Liberal Party in terms of political positioning. There was an ideological debate going on as to whether the party should be a party of classical liberal ideas, Free Trade, small government and individual liberty or if it should stand for social liberalism in the more recent traditions of H H Asquith's post-1908 administration, the economic thinking of John Maynard Keynes and the social and industrial heritage of William Beveridge and David Lloyd George.G Lippiatt, entry on the Radical Reform Group in Brack & Randall, Dictionary of Liberal Thought: Politico\u2019s, 2007 p.239 Together with Lady Megan Lloyd George and Edgar Granville, Roberts was one of a group of MPs determined to stand up against what they saw as the party's drift to the Right under the leadership of Clement DaviesD Dutton.

After the 1951 general election a number of leading Radicals gave up on the Liberal Party with Lady Megan and Granville defecting to Labour followed soon after by other former MPs Dingle Foot and Wilfrid Roberts."]}, {"page": "Welsh Liberal Party", "response": ["At the 1945 General Election the Liberal Party was reduced to a small group of twelve MPs, of whom seven represented Welsh constituencies. This group of seven has been described by a prominent historian of Welsh Liberalism, J. Graham Jones, as \"a disparate team. lacking in cohesion and a common political philosophy\". Emrys Roberts and Megan Lloyd George were increasingly close to Labour on issues such as the formation of the National Health Service. In contrast, Lady Megan's brother Gwilym, who represented Pembrokeshire, drifted towards the Conservatives and had the Liberal whip withdrawn in 1946. Clement Davies, who became party leader in 1945, and had represented Montgomeryshire since 1929, had been a member of the Liberal faction led by Sir John Simon in the 1930s but had subsequently become more radical in his views. Rhys Hopkin Morris, who won Carmarthen from Labour against the tide in 1945, was fiercely independent in his views, while Roderic Bowen, elected for the first time in Cardiganshire in 1945, was at the time an unknown quantity. Finally, the University of Wales seat (abolished in 1950) as held by the academic Professor W. J. Gruffydd, who had defeated former Plaid Cymru president Saunders Lewis in a fiercely contested by-election in 1943. Despite these differences within the group, the fact remained that the rural west and north Wales was now one of the party's last remaining sources of significant support.
