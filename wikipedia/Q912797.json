He formed a quartet with soprano saxophonist, Steve Lacy, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Dennis Charles. Taylor's first recording, Jazz Advance, featured Lacy and was released in 1956. The recording is described by Richard Cook and Brian Morton in the Penguin Guide to Jazz: \"While there are still many nods to conventional post-bop form in this set, it already points to the freedoms in which the pianist would later immerse himself.\" Taylor's quartet featuring Lacy also appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival, which was made into the album At Newport. Taylor collaborated with saxophonist John Coltrane in 1958 on Stereo Drive, now available as Coltrane Time."]}, {"page": "Chris Bambery", "response": ["In 2014 his A People's History of Scotland and his The Second World War: A Marxist History were published. A review of the former in The Scotsman stated:  \"In telling the stories of the ordinary footsoldiers in the Radical War of 1820, of the cotton spinners\u2019 strike of 1837 and of the miners\u2019 struggles from 1840 to 1984, in describing the lives of such as Mary Brooksbank and James Connolly, Bambery offers a Scottish version of EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class\"  Brian Morton in The Herald described its \"relentless populism\" as \"tiresome\" but concluded that it was \"pamphleteering of an attractively old-fashioned sort, but on an ambitious scale... It's to be hoped that Bambery's steady insistence on social justice as a higher political end, above party or nationalism, remains audible.\""]}, {"page": "Serge Chaloff", "response": ["Richard Cook and Brian Morton in The Penguin Guide to Jazz declared the album 'Chaloff's masterpiece' and described it as 'vigorous and moving... \"Thanks for the Memory\" is overpoweringly beautiful as Chaloff creates a series of melodic variations which match the improviser's ideal of fashioning an entirely new song. 'Stairway to the Stars' is almost as fine, and the thoughtful 'The Goof and I' and 'Susie's Blues' show that Chaloff still had plenty of ideas about what could be done with a bebopper's basic materials.  This important session has retained all its power.'Richard Cook and Brian Morton, The Penguin Guide to Jazz, 1992"]}, {"page": "Man in the Air", "response": ["\"This is perhaps the jazz vocal album of the last decade. Almost ten years on from his debut, Elling delivers a bold and accomplished performance, marked by highly original choice of material and some devastating playing from his regular band\", write Richard Cook and Brian Morton in their Penguin Guide to Jazz. \"Elling's scat and his delivery of a ballad are now so confident that he is able to take on material like John Coltrane's 'Resolution' and bring to it a genuine philosophical understanding as well as a musically coherent performance.\" In 2006 they concluded: \"This is a remarkable record, as accessible as it is challenging.\" In their definitive Penguin Jazz Guide from 2010 they did not change any of the review but went even further closing: \"It is so good, it's almost sinful.\"Cook, Richard and Morton, Brian (2010), The Penguin Jazz Guide, London: Penguin Books, p. 685, "]}]}}
