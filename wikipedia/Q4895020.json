All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including Arsenal and Newcastle United. Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary Bert Cooke reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to Birkenhead General Hospital).", "He later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of the Football Association, but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\" Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at Holywell, North Wales in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head."]}, {"page": "Tommy Jones (footballer, born 1909)", "response": ["Born in Tonypandy, Rhondda, Jones began his football career with Mid Rhondda, before joining Tranmere Rovers of the Football League Third Division North in 1926.

Whenever anyone is in trouble, off comes his coat and up come his sleeves.\" Despite his father's claims, Jones was in reality a fairly mild player but it took some time for him to live the story down.
