It may be there that he met Frances Rachel Bailey, known as \"Billy\", whom he married just before his death. Bailey also left her home in London to live on the Riviera. She was born in 1909 in Belgravia, London, to an upper-class family. Her mother was Lady Gwendolyn Clarendon-Hyde, and her father was Major Francis Bailey. The Scotsman write that Billy was a lesbian and speculate that her rejection of her origins may have been related to her sexuality and that she and Quaglino were kindred spirits. Cagnes-sur-Mer had a reputation for bohemianism, later the lesbian nightclub singer Suzy Solidor would live in the town. According to The Scotsman, Bailey was the long term lover of adventurer and travel writer Barbara Toy.", "On 13 May 1972, Quaglino and Billy Bailey married in Antibes. Billy's executor, John Jarvis-Smith, speculated that there was a deal between the two whereby Billy would look after Quaglino, who was in poor health, and Billy would be able to claim Quaglino's pension after his death. After Quaglino died at Pollone in around October 1972, the Italian authorities refused to pay the pension however as the couple had not been married the necessary two years. Quaglino's photographs, many never published, passed to Billy and on her death into the control of Jarvis-Smith. They were auctioned in Edinburgh in November 2003 by Lyon & Turnbull."]}, {"page": "Jarvis-Smith, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Jarvis-Smith"]}]}}
