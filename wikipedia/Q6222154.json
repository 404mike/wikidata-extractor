He became captain of Bristol in 1957 and was central in the club's adoption of an adventurous and attractive style of play that became known as \"rugby Bristol fashion\".\nBlake's approach to the game was immediately successful.  During his first season in charge the club records for both points scored and wins in a season were broken.  The points scored record was then broken in the two subsequent seasons.\nEschewing kicking, Blake emphasised passing and running with the ball.  England selectors rejected this rugby philosophy and Blake never represented his country.  He did, however play for Gloucestershire, Somerset, the Combined Services, the RAF and the Western Counties.  He also played for the Barbarians.\nBy profession a teacher, Blake was an inspirational teacher of history at Henbury School in Bristol, as well as St Brendan's College, and was Headmaster of St Wilfrid's Catholic Comprehensive in Crawley, Sussex. He was buried in the graveyard of the Friary Church, Crawley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol Bears", "response": ["Fly half John Blake became captain in 1957 and under his leadership the club developed an entertaining running style of rugby involving backs and forwards, which was years ahead of its time.
