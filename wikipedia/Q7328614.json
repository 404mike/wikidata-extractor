Bill Randall of The Comics Journal described the manga's stories \"as subtle as pissing in someone's face\", but acknowledged Tatsumi's place in manga history and the strength of his images. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly observed that Tatsumi tackles difficult subjects, but instead of exploiting, he humanizes his characters. It also called his art masterful in how he varies his style and depicts \"graceful motion, grisly suffering and complicated emotion.\" Gordon Flagg of Booklist noted that the stories in the manga are more political than usual for Tatsumi in their portrayal of postwar Japan, saying of the manga: \"Tatsumi's mastery of the visual simplicity of classic manga gives a stark power to these devastating, uncompromising pieces.\" Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the stories as \"remarkable, amazing\" saying that their style is \"spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power.\" Andrew Wheeler of ComicMix preferred the stories translated in Abandon the Old in Tokyo, but still found the stories \"Hell\" and the titular work to be comparable, calling the manga \"a stunning achievement, a collection of dark, realistic stories from a side of the world we rarely see.\" Calling the manga bleak, Tom Baker of The Daily Yomiuri said that \"there's no point in reading such depressing stuff unless it is done very well.
