In 1799, after he had attended school at Pitlessie, Kingskettle and Cupar, his father reluctantly agreed to his becoming a painter. Through the influence of the Earl of Leven Wilkie was admitted to the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, and began the study of art under John Graham. From William Allan (afterwards Sir William Allan and president of the Royal Scottish Academy) and John Burnet, the engraver of Wilkie's works, we have an interesting account of his early studies, of his indomitable perseverance and power of close application, of his habit of haunting fairs and marketplaces, and transferring to his sketchbook all that struck him as characteristic and telling in figure or incident, and of his admiration for the works of Alexander Carse and David Allan, two Scottish painters of scenes from humble life."]}, {"page": "John Graham", "response": ["*John Graham (painter) (1754\u20131817), Scottish painter and teacher of art", "*John Graham (producer) (fl. 2000s), British music producer", "*John Graham, Earl of Menteith (died 1346), Scottish soldier", "*John Graham (pirate) (fl. 1683\u20131686), English pirate active off New England", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1778) (1778\u20131821), founder of Grahamstown, South Africa", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1923) (1923\u20132012)", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Menteith (c.1529\u2013c.1565), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 6th Earl of Menteith (c.1571\u2013c.1598), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose (1548\u20131608), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose (died 1626), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (1648\u20131689), Scottish nobleman and soldier", "*John Graham (died 1755), Scottish politician, MP for Stirlingshire 1722\u201327", "*John Graham (Irish republican) (1915\u20131997), Irish republican", "*Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet (1926\u20132019), British diplomat who was ambassador to Iraq, Iran and NATO", "*John Graham (loyalist) (born c.1945), Ulster loyalist figure", "*John Graham (diplomat) (1774\u20131820), American acting Secretary of State", "*John Graham (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131926), New Zealand politician", "*John Graham (Manitoba politician) (1864\u20131951), politician in Manitoba, Canada", "*John Graham (Australian politician), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*John Graham (Nunavut politician), politician in Nunavut, Canada", "*John Graham (clergyman) (1774\u20131844), champion of Protestantism in Ireland", "*John Graham (bishop) (1794\u20131865), bishop of Chester, 1845\u20131865", "* Alex Graham (footballer) (1889\u20131972), sometimes identified as John Graham, Scottish footballer for Arsenal, Brentford, Scotland", "* John Graham (forward) (1873\u2013?), English footballer who played as a forward for Newton Heath (Manchester United)", "* John Graham (full back) (1873\u20131925), English footballer for Millwall, Arsenal, Fulham", "* John Graham (footballer, born 1926), English footballer for Aston Villa, Wrexham, Rochdale, and Bradford City", "* John Graham Jr. (golfer) (1877\u20131915), Scottish amateur golfer", "* John Graham (rugby union) (1935\u20132017), New Zealand player, administrator, and educator", "* John Graham (long-distance runner) (born 1956), Scottish marathon runner", "* John Graham (hurdler) (born 1965), Canadian track and field athlete", "* John Graham (racing driver) (born 1966), Canadian", "* John Graham (cricketer) (born 1978), English cricketer", "* John Graham, Sr. (1873\u20131955), architect and founder of John Graham & Company", "* John Graham, Jr. (architect) (1908\u20131991)", "* John Graham (journalist) (1926\u20131974), British political journalist and editor", "* John Graham (Canadian activist) (born 1954), First Nations and AIM activist who murdered opponent", "* John Graham (policy analyst) (born 1956)", "* John Graham (economist) (born 1961), American economist and professor"]}, {"page": "William Allan (painter)", "response": ["Allan was born in Edinburgh, the son of William Allan Snr., macer, an officer of the Court of Session.
