Her move to Nova Scotia signaled a pivotal turn in her work; she started to incorporate the medium of rug hooking into her work, creating a unique visual style.  Edell\u2019s work with this medium mixes the traditional practices of rug hooking with controversial themes such as feminism, sexuality, and death.  She used the narrative possibilities of this medium to express a dream like quality with art historical references, sensuality, journeys and wit. \u201cUsing found wool rag (used clothing) and a traditional method of shrinking, she began to construct images that spoke of enclosed interior (indoor) spaces as related to the gender issue.  She explores a socially-constructed gender that is developed through the use of myth (often Assyrian) and stereotype\u201d.  Rug hooking and other domestic and often textile-based crafts, like quilting, knitting, sewing, and embroidery are often associated with the \u2018feminine arts\u2019.  Because of this association with femininity and the domestic, they were devalued within the male-dominated hierarchy of art.   Edell, along with artists like Joyce Wieland, Kate Walker, Eva Hesse, Jackie Winsor, Miriam Schapiro pushed the boundaries between craft and art in the 1960-80s. They argued the distinction between craft and art was a gendered one."]}, {"page": "Catherine Mary Wade", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kate Walker (writer)"]}]}}
