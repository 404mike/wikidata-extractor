The concept album tells the story of\u00a0 ex-CIA agent Peter Beter (who allegedly provided secret information on tapes) from the perspective of a teenager who wants to fight \"the system\" only to ultimately succumb to it. The album had 12 songs, and on the back cover art they printed \"They Made Me Criminal\". However, that song was never part of the album. The album got great reviews from the magazine Sounds, while the magazine Record Mirror reacted somewhat cautiously to it. Writing for Allmusic, Dave Thompson wrote that the album \"remains one of the most foreboding records ever released and plunges the listener into a world of Bolshevik plots, duplicate Popes, and a third World War that is so close you can smell it\". An Allmusic review described the music as \"gutsy pop-punk built around razor-sharp guitars\".Heibutzki, Ralph \"Only Lovers Left Alive Review\", Allmusic.
