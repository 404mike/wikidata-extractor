He is best known for winning the 1985 World Snooker Championship, where he defeated the defending champion Steve Davis in a final widely recognised as one of the most famous matches in professional snooker history. Despite losing the first eight frames, Taylor recovered to win 18\u201317 in a dramatic duel on the last black ball. The final's conclusion attracted 18.5 million viewers, setting UK viewership records for any post-midnight broadcast and for any broadcast on BBC Two that still stand to this day.\nTaylor had previously been runner-up at the 1979 World Snooker Championship, where he lost the final 16\u201324 to Terry Griffiths. His highest world ranking of his career was in 1979\u20131980, when he was second. He won one other ranking title at the 1984 Grand Prix, where he defeated Cliff Thorburn 10\u20132 in the final, and also won the invitational 1987 Masters, defeating Alex Higgins 9\u20138 in the final. He made the highest break of his career at the 1987 Carling Challenge, a 141.\nBeginning in 1983, Taylor wore distinctive glasses designed by Jack Karnehm specifically for playing snooker. Often described as looking upside-down, they gave him a unique look on the circuit. Since retiring from the main professional tour in 2000, he has been a regular commentator on BBC snooker broadcasts. He competed on the World Seniors Tour until he announced the end of his competitive playing career in 2021, aged 72.
