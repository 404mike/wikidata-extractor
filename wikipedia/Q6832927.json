He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St. John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Alvah Miller, went on to marry her niece Clarissa Boehmer. Apart from Agatha, they had two other children, Margaret Watts and Louis Montant Miller.  Christie attributed the inspiration for the character to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\". Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

The audience watched the tangled skein unravelled by the eminent French detective, M.
