The decision had been made through an commissioned Institutional Review process chaired by Valentine and was met with national and international outcry including a petition signed by over 40,000 people. The decision was announced first on 19 May.  The review process had begun in February 2021 led by Valentine."]}, {"page": "Feminist geography", "response": ["Challenges of feminist geography are also embedded in the subfield itself. The epistemology of feminist geography argues that the positionalities and lived experiences of the geographers are as central to scholarship as what is being researched. In this way, feminist geographers must maintain diverse identities to fully engage with the discipline. Linda Peake and Gill Valentine point out that, while feminist geography has addressed gender issues in more than twenty-five countries across the world, scholarship in the field of feminist geography is primarily conducted by white female scholars from institutions in the Global North. In this way, feminist geography faces not only barriers rooted in the academy but a lack of diversity in its own field."]}, {"page": "Stranger danger", "response": ["The notion of \"stranger danger\" has been criticized for positioning children as passive objects of potential threat which allows adults to justify their means of controlling or isolating children. Gill Valentine argues that producing misleading or exaggerated messages about \"stranger danger\" results in the notion that public spaces are naturally adult spaces where children must be constantly protected.Valentine, Gill (2004). Public Space and the Culture of Childhood. Routledge. p. 91."]}, {"page": "Sexuality and space", "response": ["Although 'minority' sexuality remains a topic that hardly gets a mention in school geography, it has become an accepted part of many university geography departments and is often taught as part of courses on Social and Cultural Geography. Arguably, the most influential book-publication to position sexuality as an accepted part of geography was Mapping Desire, an edited collection by David Bell and Gill Valentine. Bell and Valentine provide a critical review of the history of geographical works on sexuality and set an agenda for further research. They are especially critical of the earliest sexual geographies written during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK and North America. In contrast to the 'dots on maps' approach of the 1970s and 1980s, Mapping Desire represents an attempt to map the geographies of homosexuality, transsexuality, bisexuality, sadomasochism and butch-femme lesbian identities.Bell, D. & Valentine G. (eds) (1995) Mapping desire: geographies of sexualities. London: Routledge. This represented an important landmark in geographers' engagement with, and development of, queer theory. Subsequent research has developed this work, with an increasing focus on transnational LGBT activism; the intersections of nationhood and sexuality and questions of LGBT citizenship and sexual politics at scales from the body to the global."]}, {"page": "Trevor J.
