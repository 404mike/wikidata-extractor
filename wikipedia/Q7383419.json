During the 1940s he also wrote detective fiction under the pseudonym R. T. Campbell and children's fiction during the 1950s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dylan Thomas", "response": ["A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month, over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3\u00a0November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel, he went out again for a drink at 2\u00a0am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, \"I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!\" The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later, he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel.Ferris (1989), p. 336 Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11\u00a0pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.Ferris (1989), p. 338Ruthven Todd states in his letter dated 23 November that the police were called, who then called the ambulance, while Ferris in his 1989 biography writes that Feltenstein was summoned again and called the ambulance. D. N. Thomas concurs that Feltenstein eventually returned at 1\u00a0am and summoned the ambulance, although it took nearly another hour to get him admitted to the hospital."]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Ruthven Todd (1914\u20131978, S)"]}, {"page": "1978", "response": ["* October 11 \u2013 Ruthven Todd, Scottish poet, artist, and novelist (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "1946 in literature", "response": ["* Ruthven Todd "]}, {"page": "Modern Scottish Poetry", "response": ["Margot Robert Adamson - Marion Angus - George Bruce - Helen B.
