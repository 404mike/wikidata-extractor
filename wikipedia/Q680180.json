At Rangers, he scored 41 league goals and was part of a squad that won five domestic trophies in his first two seasons.

Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989\u201390 season, and in the next, four goals in 36 games.

Cantona made his debut for Leeds in a 2\u20130 loss at Oldham Athletic on 8 February 1992. At Leeds, he was part of the team that won the final Football League First Division title before it was replaced by the Premier League as the top division in English football. He made 15 appearances, and despite only scoring three goals, he was instrumental in their title success, primarily with assists for leading goalscorer Lee Chapman. Cantona scored his first goal for Leeds in a 2\u20130 win at home to Luton Town on 29 February, and set up the other goal for Chapman.Auclair (2009), p. 193. Having played little football in the six weeks before signing for Leeds, Cantona struggled to find a place in an established line-up, with manager Howard Wilkinson preferring to put him on against tiring defences. Against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 7 March, Cantona came off the bench to set up a goal for Gary McAllister, securing a win that moved Leeds two points ahead of Manchester United, who had a game in hand, in the title race.Auclair (2009), pp. 193\u20135. Cantona was deployed as a part of a front three, along with Chapman and Rod Wallace, in a 5\u20131 thrashing of Wimbledon at Elland Road on 14 March, scoring Leeds' fourth goal of the game.Auclair (2009), p. 196."]}, {"page": "List of twins", "response": ["* Ray and Rod Wallace (1969\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Howard Wilkinson", "response": ["In Leeds' first season in the First Division they performed very well for a newly promoted team and ended the season fourth in the league.

During his 6 seasons in charge, Saints were under-achievers and his best result was in 1989\u201390 with a finish in 7th place achieved largely thanks to 20 goals from Le Tissier and 18 from Rod Wallace, although they did reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1986 and the same stage of the League Cup a year later. This was relatively good for a club of Southampton's size, and under Nicholl they finished higher in the league than a number of bigger clubs including Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Chelsea, but under McMenemy they had won the FA Cup in 1976, finished league runners-up in 1984 and then fifth in his final season.", "Nicholl was responsible for bringing some of the club's most successful players into the first team.
