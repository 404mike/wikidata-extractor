The possible marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, was known in history under the name \"Spanish Match\", and caused an internal political crisis in both England and Scotland. In 1623 the Prince of Wales, accompanied by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, visited Madrid to meet his intended bride. However, Maria Anna did not wish to marry a Protestant and Charles would not convert to Catholicism. At the end, the wedding never took place not only for political reasons but also because of the reluctance of the new Spanish King to conclude a dynastic marriage with the House of Stuart.Beatrix Bastl, Jose Luis Colomer: Dos infantas espa\u00f1olas en la corte imperial [retrieved 1 November 2016].Pauline Gregg King Charles I - The Spanish Match, pp. 72\u201389.

It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach and remove the king's leading counsellors for high treason. Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, 1st Baron Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he fled to Holland. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.Pauline Gregg, King Charles I (1981), pp 324\u201326.Conrad Russell, \"Why Did Charles I Call the Long Parliament?.\" History 69.227 (1984): 375\u2013383. onlinePaul Christianson, \"The Peers, the People, and Parliamentary Management in the First Six Months of the Long Parliament.\" Journal of Modern History 49.4 (1977): 575\u2013599. online"]}, {"page": "Gregg, Pauline", "response": ["#REDIRECTPauline Gregg"]}]}}
