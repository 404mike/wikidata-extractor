However, McGregor broke his leg in a biking accident in February 2007 during the second series of Long Way Round and was forced to leave the project.Reynolds, Simon. \"Gerald McMorrow ('Franklyn')\", \"Digital Spy\", 27 February 2009.  Actors Ryan Phillippe, Eva Green, and newcomer Sam Riley were cast in Franklyn in September 2007.  Phillippe was the last to be cast in what McMorrow termed a 'now or never' situation, saying of their first meeting: \"You have preconceptions about people... You expect the bleach-blond Californian kid and what you got was an incredibly erudite, brought-up-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks Philadelphia actor. When I met him we did not stop talking all afternoon.\"", "Derek Elley of Variety thought the premise better suited to a novella rather than a feature film, believing that Franklyn lacked an emotional payoff. Elley criticized the script for not developing the ideas it introduced and for lacking background on the characters. The critic also considered Phillippe and Riley to be poor casting in their roles, while Green could not present her dual roles dramatically.  Jason Solomons of The Observer reviewed the film, \"The visual style is impressive but the storylines are thin and the characters all extremely irritating.\" Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International weighed in: \"It's unusual in the current film-making climate to see an independent director making such an ambitious debut as Gerald McMorrow's Franklyn. He aims high, visually and conceptually, but a more experienced director would have trouble finding the right tone to pull this intricate plot off. Notices should be at least encouraging: McMorrow has pulled off a very handsome look on a limited budget.\""]}, {"page": "McMorrow", "response": ["*Gerald McMorrow (born 1970), director and writer of the short film Thespian X (2002)"]}, {"page": "HanWay Films", "response": ["Other releases include Jon Amiel's Creation starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly (produced by Thomas), which opened the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, Sunshine Cleaning starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt; Gerald McMorrow\u2019s Franklyn starring Eva Green, Ryan Phillippe and Sam Riley (produced by Thomas), Christopher Smith\u2019s period thriller Black Death starring Sean Bean, and Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Genova starring Colin Firth."]}, {"page": "Ben Davis (cinematographer)", "response": ["| Gerald McMorrow"]}, {"page": "Gerald mcmorrow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald McMorrow"]}]}}
