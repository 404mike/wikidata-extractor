The terraces overlooking the park were designed by Sancton Wood and those around the square by John Johnson. The exteriors are largely complete, with just a couple of 20th-century infills, but many of the interiors have been reconstructed behind the facades. Many of the properties are still in residential use and command very high prices. Others are used as embassies (such as the Embassy of Costa Rica), offices, or hotels. For many years, the headquarters of The Football Association were located in Lancaster Gate and the term was often used as a metonym for the organisation, but it later relocated to Soho Square and is now based at Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "Ipswich railway station", "response": ["Architect Sancton Wood(1816-1886) won a competition to design the new station and it may have been is his design."]}, {"page": "Ely railway station", "response": ["The station building was designed by Francis Thompson (architect) although Sancton Wood as chief architect is often given credit. On opening the station building had two Italianate towers \u2013 one at the north end and the another above the booking office. There were two cubed pavilions either side of an arcade. When the station opened it had three platforms and these were linked by a footbridge to the south of the station buildings. This footbridge was later replaced (sometime before 1902) by a substantial brick footbridge located at the north end of the station but by 1925 a subway had been constructed and this is in use today (2020)."]}, {"page": "Cambridge railway station", "response": ["The station building, with its long classical fa\u00e7ade and porte-coch\u00e8re (infilled during the 20th century), has been attributed to both Sancton Wood and Francis Thompson and is listed Grade II. The long platform (platforms 1 and 4) is typical of its period but was unusual in that (apart from a brief period in the mid-19th century) it was not supplemented by another through platform until platforms 7 and 8 were added in 2011. Two further platforms (9 and 10) are proposed to the east of the station to accommodate additional planned services. There were major platform lengthenings and remodellings of the main building in 1863 and 1908.

The bridge was largely destroyed by fire in 1970, though Thompson's masonry work was incorporated into the rebuilt structure. Among his other works on the line were the stations at Holywell Junction, Flint, and Mostyn (now disused), Conwy, and Bangor.Lloyd & Insall, p. 14. Thompson was also the architect on the Conwy Railway Bridge, including making the towers castellated in order to match the nearby 13th-century Conwy Castle. The Britannia and Menai bridges both used Stephenson's pioneering tubular design. Cambridge railway station, along with Great Chesterford and Audley End on the Eastern Counties Railway, were initially credited to Sancton Wood but are now believed to be the work of Thompson.Lloyd & Insall, Introduction."]}, {"page": "Thurles railway station", "response": ["The Great Southern and Western Railway opened the station on 13 March 1848.

Here he was responsible for several station buildings including Ipswich's first railway station at Stoke Hill (since demolished). Some well-regarded examples survive at Needham Market, Stowmarket and Bury St Edmunds. During this period he also worked closely with Sancton Wood whom he had known when they worked for Sidney Smirke. Sancton Wood is often jointly credited with Barnes on the design of some stations which are in a Jacobean style. "]}]}}
