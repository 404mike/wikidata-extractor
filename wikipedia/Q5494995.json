He was released from Wandsworth prison in 1941, at the age of 35, for exemplary behaviour. He is believed to have then returned to Abertillery, and visited the graves of his victims. By 1947, Jones was living in Fulham, London. All the Stripper murders had similar features to his early murders, with no sexual assault, but extreme violence, inflicted on the victims. Due to poor record-keeping, he was never considered as a possible suspect by the police.
