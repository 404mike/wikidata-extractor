He was known for overdosing himself with medication and rolling a heated cannonball over himself to speed up digestion. While on a beach at Dunwich in 1885, he saved a girl from drowning and the local newspapers hoped that he would be awarded a gallantry medal by the Royal Humane Society. As a bacteriologist with associations with several others like Emanuel Edward Klein (Charles Smart Roy also worked at the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution) who were involved in a major public debate on vivisection, Hankin was seen by some press reporters as a \"vivisector\" who had \"escaped\" to India."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["|Charles Smart Roy||12 June 1884||27 January 1854 \u2013 4 October 1897\t"]}, {"page": "James Lorrain Smith", "response": ["He studied for a general Arts, graduating with an MA in 1893 and allowing him to then study medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated with an MB ChB in 1889.
