The song was written after the band's label told them that their 1976 album Gold Plated lacked a standout track and asked them to \"try and write a hit\". They then wrote it, in the words of its bassist Derek Holt, \"from absolutely nowhere\", and it hit #10 on the UK Singles Chart.", "In an interview with Songfacts, Derek Holt explained that the song was \"just a lucky moment in time\", and that it is about being on the road in America. The chorus \"kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night\" referred to searches for Holiday Inn signs, the sight of which meant that beds had been found for the night. When the band's career first started in America, they used to fly everywhere, in some cases involving up to three flights just to get to one place. Their itineraries meant that getting to any one place was difficult and involved arriving in a town, getting into a car, getting to the gig just in time to perform the sound check, performing the gig, re-entering the car and then looking for a bed. The final few years of the band's life were easier as they switched to using tour buses. This enabled them to leave the gig, enter the bus, get a bed, drive extended distances (in Holt's words, \"1,000 miles or whatever\") and turn up at the next gig refreshed. The saxophonist Colin Cooper sang the baritone lead on this song, with the bassist Derek Holt, guitarist Pete Haycock and drummer John Cuffley singing harmony."]}, {"page": "I Love You (Climax Blues Band song)", "response": ["\"I Love You\" was also covered by the band the H Factor, and was released as a single, from their 1989 sole eponymous album. Two members of the H Factor, Pete Haycock and Derek Holt, were members of the Climax Blues Band before forming the H Factor with Steve Hunter. Holt also recorded his own version of the song on the 1999 album After the Climax - I Love You."]}]}}
