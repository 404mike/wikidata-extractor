In general the OIs defeated the Labour Students in all elections bar the Presidency, which was won by Mandy Telford. Subsequently, the OIs and Labour Students fluctuated between co-operation at times, but fierce opposition at others. It was in this 2004-6 period that the later-Mayor of Islington Kat Fletcher of CFE/AWL was elected President; Fletcher was the first since 1981 to be elected from a political slate clearly to the left of either Labour Students or the OIs. In recent years there has therefore been renewed confusion over the exact membership of the OIs, stemming from a series of notable factional shifts within the NUS by several individuals and the emergence of more than one group of independents who organise together."]}, {"page": "The Sheffield College", "response": ["*Kat Fletcher"]}, {"page": "List of University of Leeds people", "response": ["*Kat Fletcher, president of the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom, 2004-2006 (Sociology)"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|David Lammy, Boris Johnson, Sarah Teather, Jimmy Carr, Kat Fletcher", "|Peter Hain, Theresa May, Tim Razzall, John Sergeant, Kat Fletcher"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| Kat Fletcher"]}, {"page": "National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts", "response": ["National student campaigns for free education in the UK have always existed; the first organised group was the Campaign for Free Education (CFE), founded in 1995 in opposition to proposals by Labour Students for the NUS to abandon its opposition to the abolition of student grants.
