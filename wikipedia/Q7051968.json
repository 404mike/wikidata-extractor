Bettison denied the claim, and other allegations about his conduct, saying: Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be.

I have never, since hearing the Taylor evidence unfold, offered any other interpretation in public or private.
