He played as an opening batsman for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1934 to 1955 and for England in 79 Test matches between 1937 and 1955.  Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described him as \"one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket\".  He set a record in 1938 for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 runs against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years (and remains an England Test record).  Following the Second World War, he was the mainstay of England's batting.  In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th Century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won the Ashes the following year for the first time in 19 years.\nMarked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself at county level.  By 1937, he was playing for England and when the war interrupted his career in 1939, critics regarded him as one of the leading batsmen in the country, and even the world.  During the war, he received a serious injury to his arm while taking part in a commando training course.  His arm never fully recovered, forcing him to alter his batting style.  When cricket restarted, Hutton resumed his role as one of England's leading batsmen; by the time of England's tour to Australia in 1950\u201351, the team relied heavily on his batting and did so for the remainder of his career.  As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and built his style on a sound defence.  Although capable of attacking strokeplay, both Yorkshire and England depended on him, and awareness of this affected his style.  Hutton remains statistically among the best batsmen to have played Test cricket.\nHutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, although his leadership was at times controversial.  His cautious approach led critics to accuse him of negativity.  Never comfortable in the role, Hutton felt that the former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn.  Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season.  Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, he went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster.  He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984.  Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990.  He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["The 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1\u20131 result, Australia retaining the Ashes.

He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 at the start of the season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. He had yet to make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but was so nervous he could barely watch.Cowdrey, pp. 55\u201356", "The MCC team was seen off by family, friends and well-wishers on the \u2019'Orsava'\u2019.

He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", a fellow Oxford University man who had come down especially to see Cowdrey. Soon after the voyage began Cowdrey and Tyson were warned by the captain Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches, but in the end their efforts would prove decisive in England's victory.Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon: The Inside Story of the MCC Tour of Australia and New Zealand 1954/55, Parrs Wood Press (2004), pp. 23, 252 They traveled first-class on the Orsova which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon, where Cowdrey made 66 not out.

Laker accepted but was then astonished when Holdsworth tried to persuade him to return and play for Yorkshire. Although Laker did not like the social divide in place at Surrey, he wished to stay with his adopted county and thanked Holdsworth for the offer, which he declined. Len Hutton recalled that, also in 1948, he was asked by the Yorkshire committee to make some discreet enquiries about Laker's situation in Surrey. He reported back that Laker was content where he was and did not wish to play for Yorkshire.

He had reached double figures in 18 of his 22 Test innings, although his highest score was still only 66. But, in the three years following the 1957 tour, he fulfilled his promise. In his next 24 Tests, he scored 2,250 runs at the exceptionally high average of 93.75. In 1958, he scored his maiden Test century against Pakistan in Kingston and expanded it to an unbeaten 365, breaking the world record Test score of 364 set by England's Len Hutton in 1938. Sobers batted for 614 minutes and scored 38 fours but, unusually in such a large total, no sixes. At 21 years and 216 days, he is the youngest player to break the individual scoring record in Tests, and remains the youngest triple-centurion.Don Bradman, at Headingley in 1930, was three months older than Sobers when he broke the record. Bradman's innings remains the only other instance of a Test triple century scored before the player's 22nd birthday. Sir Garfield Sobers set the world records for the highest maiden test ton(365*) as well as becoming the first batsman in test history to convert his maiden test ton into a triple ton.

He dedicated his life to the art of batting, practising assiduously and eschewing any shot that might even hint at threatening the loss of his wicket.\" Through his Test career, he scored 15.4% of England's runs, and England won 32.41% of the Tests in which Boycott played. This compares with England's 34.76% victory rate over all Test cricket history. Richard Hutton, Yorkshire and England batsman and son of Len Hutton, described Boycott as a \"one-pace player\", suggesting that he was unable to alter his playing pace as the match circumstances dictated.McKinstry, p. 114. Nevertheless, Boycott maintained an \"impeccable\" defensive technique, and possessed a temperament ideally suited for five-day Test matches.McKinstry, p. 51. Arlott wrote that \"his technique is based on a defence organised as near flawlessness as may be.\"Arlott, p. 127. Boycott himself remarked, in 1981, that: \"Given the choice between Raquel Welch and a hundred at Lord's, I'd take the hundred every time.\" His careful batting is reflected in his 22 centuries for England, of which only two had a strike rate of over 51.00.

Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25.", "National service restricted Trueman to just nine first-class matches in 1952 but four of them were Tests. He made his debut for England on Thursday, 5 June in the first Test against India at Headingley. Len Hutton had been appointed England captain before the series as the first professional to hold the post in the 20th century and the first ever to hold it in a home series. The appointment was controversial, especially among the amateur establishment, but Hutton had \"an easy initiation against a weak Indian side, who did not relish the tearaway bowling of the young Trueman\".Birley, p. 284. England, for whom Trueman opened the bowling with Alec Bedser, won the match in four days by 7 wickets. After taking three for 89 in the first innings when India scored 293, Trueman produced a sensational opening spell in the second innings and, after only 14 balls had been bowled, India were reduced to none for four, Trueman taking three of the wickets. He finished with four for 27 as India recovered to score 165. England had made 334 in the first innings and a second innings total of 128 for three secured the win. England won the second Test at Lord's by 8 wickets. Trueman, again opening the bowling with Bedser, took four for 72 and four for 110. In the third Test at Old Trafford, England won by an innings and 207 runs with Trueman taking eight for 31 and one for 9. The fourth and final Test at the Oval was ruined by rain and drawn after England scored 326 for six declared and India had been bowled out for only 98. Trueman with five for 48 and Bedser with five for 41 were almost unplayable. Trueman's tally of wickets in his debut series was therefore 29. He had a problem during the season in \"a tendency to get stitch\", which was diagnosed as \"a lack of regular fast bowling exercise\".", "In 1952, after Trueman's early success against India, Len Hutton had commented that he needed another five years to mature as a bowler; and it was in 1957 that Trueman returned to the fore and finally became an established England player.Arlott, p. 98. He overcame his side strain and recovered his form, taking 27 wickets in his first four matches. New regulations about time-wasting caused him to reconsider his run up which he limited to eighteen yards."]}]}}
