McMillan made two first team appearances for Rangers but failed to secure a regular starting place; the majority of his time at the club was spent on loan at Hamilton Academical, Queen of the South and Wrexham. McMillan left Rangers in 2013 to join fellow Scottish Premier League side Dunfermline Athletic. He was made redundant the following season after the club entered administration.\nIn March 2013, McMillan joined Scottish First Division side Partick Thistle and became part of their title-winning team. He was released from his contract in February 2015, following a failed drugs test, and was subsequently banned from all competitive sport for two years. McMillan returned to football in 2017, signing a short-term contract with Clyde, before spending time with Cambuslang Rangers, Edusport Academy, Dumbarton and Pollok.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dunfermline Athletic F.C.", "response": ["| scope=\"row\"| Jordan McMillan"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C.

Bryan Jackson, who was appointed to oversee the administration proceedings, announced on 28 March that eight players including Captain Jordan McMillan were to be made redundant, however manager Jefferies stayed, on the condition of his salary would be reduced. Assistant manager Gerry McCabe was also made redundant the following day. Players made redundant only had until 31 March to find new clubs, as this was the last day of player registrations for the 2012\u201313 season. The club's shareholder Gavin Masterton, who was responsible for placing the club in administration, apologised for his action. A week before the club went to administration, Pars Community, the club's largest supporters group, made a bid to buy the club, but the bid was unsuccessful and talks broke down. The club's debt is thought to be around 8.5 million pounds. On 9 April, as a result of entering administration the club were issued with a fifteen-point dedication and banned from signing any players aged over 21 until the club comes out of administration. The SFA later issued a further transfer ban running parallel to the original, meaning should the club exit administration prior to 31 December 2013 the ban would continue until that date.
