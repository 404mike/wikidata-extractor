The Avensis was built by GPRM and chosen as a demo model for the BTCC to launch the new specification ahead of the 2011 championship. Dynojet and Speedworks Motorsport ran one Toyota Avensis each in 2011, driven by Frank Wrathall and Tony Hughes respectively. Dynojet's car used a Toyota-based engine built by X Ctech R while the Speedworks car used the TOCA-BTCC unit developed by Swindon Engines, which was available for lease to all entries. The car showed top 12 potential early in the season. The Avensis scored its first points at Snetterton circuit in August 2011 at the hands of Frank Wrathall. Over the course of the season, Wrathall took four podiums. In 2012, the cars were aerodynamically upgraded to reflect the design of the new Avensis and Speedworks expanded to two cars.  Wrathall took the first win for the car and the first win for Toyota in 19 years. A fourth Toyota appeared on the grid for 2013. Adam Morgan's family-run team Ciceley Racing acquired Wrathall's 2011 car, fitted with a TOCA-BTCC engine. Five Toyota's made the 2014 grid. Speedworks ran one car whilst providing engineering support to Simon Belcher and Handy Motorsport. Following Frank Wrathall's conviction for causing death by careless driving, Dynojet sold the team's assets to United Autosports, entering Wrathall's race car and a second car using Wrathall's spare shell. The fifth Avensis was entered by Houseman Racing, running a TOCA-BTCC engine, after the team were forced to look for a new car following the abolition of the Super 2000 cars.", "* Alfa Romeo Giulietta - Simon Belcher's Handy Motorsport returned to the BTCC in 2018 with Rob Austin driving a new Alfa Romeo Giulietta, the first Alfa Romeo in the BTCC in 11 years. The car finished on the podium twice at Brands Hatch at the beginning and end of the season, ending the season 14th in the standings with 126 points."]}, {"page": "2012 Renault UK Clio Cup", "response": ["|  Simon Belcher", "|align=left|  Simon Belcher"]}, {"page": "2013 Renault UK Clio Cup", "response": ["|  Simon Belcher", "|align=left|  Simon Belcher"]}, {"page": "2014 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Simon Belcher", "* Double Renault UK Clio Cup \u2018Masters Cup\u2019 Champion Simon Belcher graduated to the BTCC in a Handy Motorsport run Toyota Avensis with assistance from Speedworks Motorsport.", "|align=left|  Simon Belcher", "|align=left|  Simon Belcher", "|align=left|  Simon Belcher"]}, {"page": "2015 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Simon Belcher", "* Robb Holland left the championship, having sold his car to AmD Tuning.
