He served for more than 50 years at St Paul's Church in the town\u2014first as a curate, then from 1873 as its vicar. As the only son of the Rev. Henry Michell Wagner (Vicar of Brighton for 46 years) and his wife Elizabeth Harriott, who died when he was a child, Arthur Wagner inherited considerable wealth. Following the pattern set by his father\u2014who founded several churches in Brighton\u2014he was able to pay for the construction and endowment of four churches in the town, three of which survive, and another in rural East Sussex where he owned a country estate. Like his father, he became embroiled in disputes and controversy: he held strongly Tractarian views and was often criticised for the advanced ritualism of the services he held at St Paul's, while his involvement in the Constance Kent affair caused national debate about priest\u2013penitent privilege.\nWagner's influence in Victorian Brighton was considerable. \"Not just a very rich clergyman of advanced religious beliefs\", he was also greatly interested in church architecture and decoration. His wealth and his successful ministry at St Paul's allowed Wagner to found new churches in growing suburbs such as Hanover, Montpelier and the London Road/Lewes Road areas, which were notable both for their richly designed interiors and for their determinedly Tractarian tradition. The vast St Bartholomew's Church continues to serve a densely populated inner-city area; St Martin's Church, built shortly afterwards, is even larger and served a district partly developed by Wagner himself; the Church of the Annunciation combines a modest exterior with striking internal fittings; and he was involved with the design and fitting out of St Paul's Church, although his father paid for it.  Arthur Wagner's influence was also seen in the \"grandeur and artistry\" of St Michael and All Angels Church, built for the ministry of one of his curates at St Paul's.  Although his official status was never more than vicar of a single church, his influence was such that \"he was acknowledged as virtual Bishop-coadjutant of Brighton\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Constance Kent", "response": ["Kent was prosecuted for the murder five years later, in 1865.

Elizabeth\u2019s home background was of a strict Calvinist regime but under the influence of her brother she adopted a Tractarian position. In 1857 Elizabeth responded to a call from Fr Charles Fuge Lowder to establish a sisterhood to assist the clergy of St George in the East, Stepney. At that time she was running a small orphanage in Brighton and working in the parish of St Paul's Church, Brighton under the guidance of its priest, Fr Arthur Wagner. Leaving the future of the orphanage in the hands of her brother and the Sisters of St Margaret, on 14 April, Elizabeth, with a fourteen-year-old orphan set up house in Stepney.

After his father's death, he resolved to build a more impressive new church in the same area. The original plan, which was submitted to the Town Council in 1871 and approved on 7 June of that year, consisted of a combined church and school building,  in length,  wide, and  high. This was amended shortly afterwards to reduce the number of bays in the interior from 13 to 11\u00bd; the additional space formed a \"courtyard\" area between the church and the existing school building, which was to be retained.", "The building work was undertaken by a Brighton company, Stanning & Co., and cost \u00a318,000 (1874 prices). This was in contrast to the \u00a325,000 spent on St Peter's church around 50 years previously, under the supervision of Arthur Wagner's father, Henry Michell Wagner. The use of Portland stone on the latter added to the expense; the use of bricks for St Bartholomew's helped to reduce it, as did the abandonment of the revised plan's intention to build 11\u00bd bays. (Only nine were constructed.) Additionally, the northern face of the church was never properly completed, and proposals for additional features such as transepts and a spire mentioned in contemporary publications were never carried out."]}, {"page": "St Paul's Church, Brighton", "response": ["Brighton-based builders Cheesman & Son, as they were known at the time, were chosen to construct the building to a design by R. C. Carpenter: they had worked with Rev. Wagner since 1834, when they built a vicarage for him, and were responsible for both Christ Church and the church of St. John the Evangelist. However, Rev. Wagner's intention had always been for the church to be his son Arthur's first ministry following his ordination, and Arthur asked for the design work to be undertaken by a separate designer. Arthur Wagner was 22 years old at the time the land was purchased, and was preparing to be ordained (this took place in 1850). He was a follower of the Oxford Movement (or Tractarian Movement), whose favoured architectural style at the time was a revival of the 14th century aspects of Gothic architecture (see also here).", "St Paul's church opened to the public on 18 October 1848 after approximately two years of building works. The cost of \u00a312,000 was met by a combination of grants from various bodies and societies, public donations, Henry Wagner himself (\u00a31,475) and other members of his family (\u00a31,263). At the time, the practice of pew rental was still common, and although Arthur Wagner wanted his church to have free seating for all, his father Henry insisted that 460 of the 1,200 seats should be reserved for rental. (The first church in Brighton to be free throughout from the time it opened was St Bartholomew's Church, for which Arthur Wagner had the sole responsibility after it opened in 1874.)", "The consecration took place on 23 October 1849, and Arthur Wagner assumed responsibility for the church in 1850 when his father presented its curacy to him in perpetuity. Rev. Arthur Wagner, as he was now titled, therefore held the position of vicar until his death in 1902 at the age of 77.", "From the beginning, St Paul's Church was associated with the Oxford Movement (or \"Tractarian Movement\") within High Church Anglicanism. Several leading figures within the movement either preached at the church at various times (Henry Manning, John Keble) or were friends and associates of Rev. Arthur Wagner (Edward Bouverie Pusey, John Henry Newman). Archdeacon Manning, as he was at the time, in fact preached the very first sermon shortly after the church opened. Services\u2014including Holy Communion\u2014were frequent and displayed many of the standard features of the then controversial Ritualism. Extreme Protestants within the Anglican Church protested strongly against this throughout the mid- to late 19th century. The existence of confessionals in the church, which became public knowledge during the 1865 murder trial of Constance Kent (who had confessed her crime to Rev. Wagner), provoked an intensely hostile reaction nationally as well as locally, with consequences ranging from debates in the House of Commons to an assault on Rev. Wagner. Similar hostility and protest were encountered during the early years of St Bartholomew's Church, whose services were similarly Anglo-Catholic and Ritualist in style.", "Under Rev Arthur Wagner the Rev.

The area chosen was largely under construction at the time, with large numbers of small terraced houses for poorer people being built to fill the space around the Lewes Road.  Some of this development was funded by Arthur Wagner himself, and as neither this area nor the nearby Round Hill district had a proper church, it was considered appropriate to finance and oversee the building of a church at the same time.

Arthur Wagner (curate and later vicar of St Paul's Church), established a house on the town's Lewes Road to which prostitutes could be sent by police and doctors to be helped and rehabilitated.  Only 12 women could be accommodated in this building, so in 1855 Wagner bought houses in Wykeham Terrace and the adjacent Queen Square and expanded the institution.  In 1857, after George Wagner died, Arthur Wagner himself took over responsibility for the home, by way of the Community of the Virgin Mary\u2014a Brighton-based convent which he had founded.  They renamed the institution St Mary's Home for Female Penitents, and expanded it further to take in all of Wykeham Terrace apart from numbers 6, 7 and 12.  The west side of Queen Square, whose buildings backed on to the terrace, was also occupied.  Although conditions for the former prostitutes were strict, with regular surveillance, hard work and punishments for misbehaviour, the institution was able to offer about 40 women proper healthcare, education, training for domestic service, and charitable help of various kinds.  Constance Kent, convicted of an infamous child murder in 1865 in a case which revolved around priest\u2013penitent privilege, worked at the Home during this time.  By the 1880s, the Home expanded further to take in disabled, elderly and destitute women from around Brighton, and orphans: nearly 300 people lived there.  The institution moved in part to Egremont Place in the Queen's Park area in 1866, and in its entirety to Rottingdean in 1912.

In 1824, when Henry Michell Wagner's tenure began, there were about 3,000 free places in the town's churches, but about 20,000 people were considered poor enough to need them. Between them, the Wagners funded 11 new churches in densely populated lower-class areas of Brighton, which contributed to the near-doubling of Anglican church provision in Brighton in a 25-year period of the mid-19th century. By the postwar period, as people moved to new suburbs and rising land values in central Brighton encouraged the replacement of houses with commercial and entertainment buildings, many of these churches were no longer needed.

In some cases vast rural parishes were subdivided; in others, chapels of ease were provided in outlying rural areas distant from their parish church.  Victorian restoration of old churches took place across the district and was particularly extensive at Hailsham, Selmeston and Uckfield, where the buildings are now essentially 19th-century.  The era of large-scale churchbuilding (as opposed to restoration) in Wealden began in the late Georgian era with the opening of a new church in Frant, built between 1819 and 1822.  The year 1836, just before Victoria's reign started, was significant: William Moseley was responsible for new churches in Forest Row and Hadlow Down that year (although the latter was greatly reworked in 1913); and Danehill, a main-road village in Fletching parish, also received its first chapel of ease in 1836.  The present church of 1892 is by Bodley and Garner.  It is the Victorian era that is most associated with the increase in churchbuilding activity, though.Elleray 1981, p. 22.

The churches at Eridge and Tidebrook date from 1852 and 1856 respectively.  James Piers St Aubyn designed a chapel of ease at Cross-in-Hand, the main settlement in Waldron parish, in 1863\u201364.  A former school was converted into a chapel of ease in Mark Cross, part of Rotherfield parish, in 1873, although it was soon granted its own parish.  A year later, work began on a church for the rapidly growing village of Polegate, and a church was built to serve the village of Horam in 1890.  Endowments by rich benefactors allowed churches to be built at High Hurstwood (1872) and Hammerwood (1880).  The wealthy Vicar of Brighton Arthur Wagner, who had a house in Buxted and established a convent there, also paid for the construction of a second church for the village in 1885\u201386.

As before, part of the cost of the church was met by members of Henry Michell Wagner's family, and he donated \u00a31,475 himself.

It was owned by Nathaniel Kemp of Ovingdean House, who appointed Rev. C.D. Maitland as Perpetual curate. Under his ministry, \"services were of the most evangelical tone imaginable\". When he died in 1865, Purchas bought the building and the right of presentation.  He had been influenced by ritualist views while working as a curate at St Paul's Church under Wagner's son Arthur.  After maintaining the chapel's evangelical style of services for several months, Purchas changed to a strongly ritualist style of worship from September 1866. The clergy wore full vestments, Purchas himself wore a cope and biretta, and incense was used throughout the service.  At a time when Roman Catholicism was still viewed with suspicion and animosity, such Catholic-style practices raised \"an immediate outcry\" among the clergy at other local churches.  Wagner received letters claiming that Purchas was trying to \"un-Protestantise our Protestant Church\" and that the blame lay with his son, Arthur Wagner, whose introduction of ritualist services at St Paul's Church \"introduced the seeds of division into the Church in Brighton\".", "St Martin's Church on the Lewes Road, near the Percy and Wagner Almshouses, was built for Arthur Wagner and his brothers in memory of their father.

When St Paul's Church opened, Arthur wanted all 1,200 seats to be free, but Henry held the more old-fashioned view that there should be a mix.  Accordingly, 460 pews were for rent and the rest were free; Arthur Wagner abolished all rented pews in 1873 after his father's death. The controversial subject caused Henry Wagner problems at other times.  In 1858, his nephew Rev. Thomas Coombe\u2014Perpetual curate of All Saints Church\u2014got into a disagreement with him after altering the interior to add extra pews for rent, and tried to prevent Wagner entering the church.  Wagner had to appeal to the Bishop of Chichester Ashurst Gilbert to deal with the situation. The events of 1824 and St Margaret's Chapel also left Wagner with \"an enduring dislike of proprietary chapels\".  In his 46 years as Vicar of Brighton, during an era when their construction was commonplace, he allowed no others to be built after St Margaret's, St George's, Holy Trinity and St Mary's were completed (the last of these opened in 1827.) When the rector of St Christopher's Church, Lympsham offered in 1858 to pay for a new proprietary chapel in Brighton with 100 free pews and 200 for rent, both Wagner and his sister wrote to him \"kindly but firmly\" describing his \"insuperable objection\" to such chapels. As Vicar of Brighton, he gained the right of presentation after each proprietary chapel had been open for 40 years; but in 1856 the Marquess of Blandford tried to abolish this right by raising a bill before Parliament.  Wagner, who \"clung firmly to the rights of presentation\" he expected to receive, tried to persuade the Marquess to exclude Brighton's four proprietary chapels from the bill\u2014first by going through his solicitor friend Somers Clarke, then by asking Brighton MPs Lord Alfred Hervey (1816\u20131875) and Sir George Brooke-Pechell, 4th Baronet for their support.
