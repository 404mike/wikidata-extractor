In a retrospective review for Blender, Christgau wrote that it was the definitive work of psychedelic music, describing the record as \"an aural utopia that accommodates both ingrained conflict and sweet, vague spiritual yearnings, held together by a master musician\". In Charlotte Greig's opinion, much like Are You Experienced, Electric Ladyland was \"groundbreaking, introducing audiences to a style of psychedelic rock rooted in the blues\". The Washington Post critic Geoffrey Himes names it an exemplary release of the progressive soul development from 1968 to 1973. Author Amy Wallace called the album a \"classic of acid rock.\""]}, {"page": "Gorky's Zygotic Mynci", "response": ["In 2010 Richard James and Euros Childs performed at Dan Rebellato's wedding, with him later telling Lauren Laverne via Twitter, \"We somehow got Gorky's Zygotic Mynci to reform and play our wedding last year, so it was wall-to-wall musical awesomeness\".
