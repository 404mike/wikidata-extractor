Unfitness was determined by the objective standard that should ordinarily be expected of people fit to be directors of companies. Directors must inform themselves of company affairs and join in with other directors to supervise those affairs. Having no adequate system of monitoring was therefore a breach of this standard. Directors may delegate functions, but they nevertheless remain responsible for those functions being carried out.  Furthermore, the degree of a director's remuneration will be a relevant factor in determining the degree of responsibility with which a director must reckon.[1999] 1 BCLC 433", "Morritt LJ, Waller LJ and Mummery LJ upheld Jonathan Parker J's decision in full.

As to that, it is in my judgment wholly unrealistic to have expected Mr Roy Richardson at that stage to have initiated a detailed investigation into the personal financial circumstances of the vendors.\""]}, {"page": "Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO Holdings Ltd", "response": ["Potter LJ, Jonathan Parker LJ and Sir Swinton Thomas dismissed the appeal.

This was analogous to the company law case on directors' duties, Peskin v Anderson[2001] BCC 874 where Mummery LJ said that fiduciary duties are owed exclusively by directors to the company, and not to shareholders individually. Outside duties can arise, but \u2018are dependent on establishing a special factual relationship between the directors and the shareholders in the particular case.\u2019 He also noted Insolvency Act 1986, section 212, allowing the court to compel an administrator to repay money as the court thinks just, or contribute sums to the company\u2019s assets for misfeasance, or beach of fiduciary duty or other duty as the court thinks just."]}, {"page": "Green v Lord Somerleyton", "response": ["Jonathan Parker 's judgment approved by the rest of the panel, held that nuisance could cover floodwater relating to a shared conduit.
