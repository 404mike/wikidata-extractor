She was born in Sheffield and worked for the local Conservative party prior to her marriage.Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin, Bruce Chatwin, ed. Elizabeth Chatwin and Nicholas Shakespeare, Vintage Books, 2011 p. 21 The Chatwin family were well known in Birmingham, with Charles Chatwin's grandfather, Julius Alfred Chatwin, an eminent architect.Bruce Chatwin, Nicholas Shakespeare, Random House, 2010, p. 28", "Chatwin returned to Sotheby's, and to the surprise of his friends, proposed marriage to Elizabeth Chanler. They married on 21 August 1965. Chatwin was bisexual throughout their married life, a circumstance Elizabeth knew and accepted. Chatwin had hoped he would \"grow out of\" his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents. During their marriage, Chatwin had many affairs, mostly with men. Some who were aware of Chatwin's affairs with men assumed the Chatwins had a chaste marriage, but according to Nicholas Shakespeare, the author's biographer, this was not true. Both Chatwin and his wife had hoped to have children, but they remained childless.", "Although The Viceroy of Ouidah received good reviews, it did not sell well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer, Chatwin said he \"decided to write something about people who never went out.\" His next book, On the Black Hill (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, The Viceroy of Ouidah, a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.", "Beyond travel, Chatwin influenced other writers, such as Claudio Magris, Luis Sep\u00falveda, Philip Marsden, and William Dalrymple. Nicholas Shakespeare stated that some of Chatwin's impact came from the difficulty of categorising his work, which helped to \"set free other writers...[from] conventional boundaries.\" Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify himself as one, or as a novelist. (\"I don't quite know the meaning of the word novel,\" he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, \"He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable.\"", "According to his biographer Nicholas Shakespeare, Chatwin's work developed a dedicated following in the years immediately after his death. By 1998 a million copies of his books had been sold. However, his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about the accuracy of his work.", "The accuracy problem had arisen before his death, and Chatwin had admitted to \"counting up the lies\" in In Patagonia, though he stated there were not many. While researching Chatwin's life, Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found \"few cases of mere invention\" in In Patagonia. Mostly, these tended to be instances of embellishment, such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of Osip Mandelstam \u2013 one of his favorite authors \u2013 when in fact she was a fan of Agatha Christie. When Michael Ignatieff asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction, he replied, \"I don't think there is [a division].\"", "The questions about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, \"His denial [of his AIDS diagnosis] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books \u2013 or else not to bother with them.\" In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, \"Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?\" However, Rory Stewart has stated, \"His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [than they once were]. And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance\".
