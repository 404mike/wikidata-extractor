Several have thatched roofs, some at two levels in a completely unnecessary but very picturesque way.  Nash published an illustrated book on the group; this was a formula with a future.Aslet and Power, 151-152; Summerson, 451 In contrast with Nash's Blaise Hamlet, Dalmeny House near Edinburgh, built in 1817 for Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery, is a large stately home in a revival of the early Tudor palace style, drawing in particular from East Barsham Manor in Norfolk, built c. 1520. At this time the style was known as \"Old English\", and considered especially appropriate for vicarages and rectories, partly because they were usually next to the church, which was likely to be Gothic, and because the larger windows patrons wanted were easier to work into the style than into a \"pointed\" Gothic.  At this stage it was essentially a style for the country rather than houses in towns. Tudor style was \"almost infinitely adaptable, particularly to low, spreading houses\",Aslet and Power, 152-153 (153 quoted), 158-159, 162 After about 1850 \"Old English\" came to mean a rather different style based on vernacular architecture, although some Tudor features such as tall brick chimneys often remained.Aslet and Power, 162-163"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of West Lothian", "response": ["* Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery 20 April 1843 \u2013 1863"]}, {"page": "Archibald John Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery"]}, {"page": "Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny", "response": ["He was the eldest son and heir apparent of Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery (1783\u20131868), whom he predeceased, by his wife Harriett Bouverie."]}, {"page": "Temple, Midlothian", "response": ["*Rosebery House, (built circa. 1805) for Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery"]}, {"page": "Archibald Primrose", "response": ["* Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery (1783\u20131868), British politician"]}, {"page": "Archibald Hood", "response": ["In 1856 Hood began expanding his business; leasing Whitehill Colliery at Rosewell (then owned by Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery).
