Coffin tackled this problem by constructing a one-mile tramline which connected his mines in Dinas to a tramline built by Dr. Richard Griffiths at Denia (modern spelling Dynea) (Pontypridd), which linked to a private canal that joined onto the Glamorganshire Canal at Treforest.Lewis (1975), p.26 Coffins tramline followed the southern bank of the River Rhondda and ran through Porth. The existence of the tramline made the development of the Porth and Cymmer region far more attractive, and by the middle of the 19th century there was an impetus to expand coal mining in the area.Lewis (1959), p.49 In 1841 Richard Lewis joined Coffin in trying to exploit the region with his level built at Cymmer. This resulted in the construction of around fifty miners' cottages, several of which were located in Porth. In 1844 Lewis Edwards of Newport and George Gethin of Penygraig opened a small level at Nyth-bran on the eastern borders of Porth, the villages' first coal mine. This was followed in 1845 by the sinking of the Porth Colliery by David James of Merthyr, the success of which saw him build the Llwyncelyn Colliery in 1851, also in Porth. By 1850 the Taff Vale Railway had been extended to Cymmer replacing the tramline, allowing direct access between the lower Rhondda and the ports of Cardiff."]}, {"page": "Rhondda", "response": ["The South Wales coalfield is the largest continuous coalfield in Britain, extending some  from Pontypool in the east to St Brides Bay in the West, covering almost .Davies (2008), p. 153. This took in most of Glamorgan and the entirety of the Rhondda within it. Although neighbouring areas such as Merthyr and Aberdare had already sunk coal mines, it was not until Walter Coffin initiated the Dinas Lower Colliery in 1812 that coal was exported from the Rhondda Valleys on any commercial scale. This was originally taken by packhorse, before the extension of Dr. Griffiths' private tramline, to Pontypridd and then by the Glamorganshire Canal to the port at Cardiff. The lack of transportation links was one of the main problems that curtailed exploitation of the Rhondda Valley coalfields, along with the belief that they lay too deep for economic working.John (1980), p. 182. It was therefore seen as an expensive risk. Exploration of the Rhondda was undertaken by the Bute Trustees, agents of the third Marquess of Bute, who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in the Cardiff Docks which would export the coal. The trustees sank the Bute Merthyr Colliery in October 1851, at the top of the Rhondda Fawr in what would become Treherbert. The Bute Merthyr began producing coal in 1855, as the first working steam-coal colliery in the Rhondda.", "Along with the sinking of the first colliery at the head of the Rhondda, a second issue, transportation, was tackled with the extension of the Taff Vale Railway (TVR); royal assent was given in 1836. The original line was laid from Cardiff to Abercynon, and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This allowed easier transportation for Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition, as Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time, the Rhondda Valley was linked by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales and exploitation of its coalfields could begin."]}, {"page": "Palatal expansion", "response": ["Westcott first reported placing mechanical forces on maxilla in 1859. Emerson C. Angell was the first person to publish a paper about palatal expansion in 1860 in Dental Cosmos. He placed a screw between the maxillary premolars of a 14-year-old girl for 2 weeks. When she returned, he observed expansion in her upper arch. In 1877, Walter Coffin developed the Coffin Spring for the purpose of arch expansion. In 1889, J. H. McQyillen who was the President of the American Dental Association at that time, opposed Angell's idea regarding arch expansion. Goddard, in 1890, and Landsberger, in 1910, revisited the idea of arch expansion. Goddard standardized the expansion protocol in adjusting the expander twice a day for 3 weeks."]}, {"page": "Dinas Rhondda", "response": ["Dinas is the site of Dinas Lower () Colliery, sunk by Walter Coffin in 1812 as the first deep coal mine in the Rhondda valley.  This was later followed by the sinking of the Dinas Middle Colliery in 1832 along the southern banks of the river Rhondda Fawr, opposite Dinas Rhondda railway station. From here coal was carried by trams via Porth, Cymmer, and Trehafod to Pontypridd, where it was conveyed by canal to Cardiff. In 1844 there was an explosion in the mine, the first major explosion to occur in the Rhondda Valleys, and twelve men and boys were killed. In 1869, a new shaft was opened in order to improve conditions in the pit. Ten years later another devastating explosion resulted in the death of 63 miners. The shaft was deepened in 1881 to reach lower seams with steam coal, but by 1887 production was declining and in 1893 production had ceased in both collieries."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cardiff||Walter Coffin|| Liberal"]}, {"page": "Cardiff (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Walter Coffin"]}, {"page": "Coffin (surname)", "response": ["* Walter Coffin, Welsh Member of Parliament and coal owner"]}, {"page": "1867 in Wales", "response": ["*15 February \u2013 Walter Coffin, industrialist, 82"]}, {"page": "1852 in Wales", "response": ["**Walter Coffin becomes the first Nonconformist MP elected in Wales."]}, {"page": "1832 in Wales", "response": ["*Walter Coffin opens the \"Rhondda No. 3\" coal seam."]}, {"page": "1780s in Wales", "response": ["**date unknown - Walter Coffin, coal-owner (died 1867)"]}, {"page": "1810 in Wales", "response": ["**Walter Coffin takes a mining lease on land at Dinas Rhondda.
