The German Government estimated it had paid the equivalent of 67.8\u00a0billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure includedother than gold or goods in kindthe scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow, state property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that  gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which  was paid before the implementation of the London Schedule of Payments. Niall Ferguson provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than  gold marks. Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his comprehensive econometric study, concedes that Germany transferred 16.8\u00a0billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. The net capital transfer into Germany amounted to 17.75\u00a0billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919\u20131931. In effect, America paid Germany four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan. According to Gerhard Weinberg, reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors. Hans Mommsen wrote \"Germany financed its reparation payments to Western creditor nations with American loans\", which the British and French then used to \"cover their long-term interest obligations and to retire their wartime debts with the United States.\"", "Historian Niall Ferguson partially supports this analysis: had reparations not been imposed, Germany would still have had significant problems caused by the need to pay war debts and the demands of voters for more social services. Ferguson argued that these problems were aggravated by a trade deficit and a weak exchange rate for the mark during 1920. Afterwards, as the value of the mark rose, inflation became a problem. None of these were the result of reparations. According to Ferguson, even without reparations total public spending in Germany between 1920 and 1923 was 33 per cent of total net national product. A.J.P. Taylor wrote \"Germany was a net gainer by the financial transactions of the nineteen-twenties: she borrowed far more from private American investors\u00a0...\u00a0than she paid in reparations\". P.M.H. Bell stated the creation of a multi-national committee, which resulted in the Dawes Plan, was done to consider ways the German budget could be balanced, the currency stabilized, and the German economy fixed to ease reparation payments. Max Winkler wrote that from 1924 onward, German officials were \"virtually flooded with loan offers by foreigners\". Overall, the German economy performed reasonably well until the foreign investments funding the economy and the loans funding reparations payments were suddenly withdrawn after the 1929 Stock Market Crash. This collapse was magnified by the volume of loans provided to German companies by US lenders. Even the reduced payments of the Dawes Plan were mainly financed through a large volume of international loans.", "According to Slavieck, the \"traditional interpretation of the treaty's impact on Germany\" was that it \"plunged the nation into an economic free fall\". This view was shared by the German people, who believed the treaty was robbing Germany of its wealth. German banker Max Warburg said the terms of the treaty were \"pillage on a global scale\". Niall Ferguson says the German view was incorrect and \"not many historians would today agree with Warburg\". However, several historians agree with Warburg.  Norman Davies writes that the treaty forced Germany to \"pay astronomic reparations\", while Tim McNeese states, \"France and Britain had placed war damages on Germany to the tune of billions of gold marks, which the defeated Germans could not begin to pay in earnest\". Ferguson says the reparations were \"less of a burden than Keynes and others claimed\" and that the \"potential burden on national income of the annuity vary from 5 percent to 10 percent\". However, he cautions against underestimating the initial German effort to pay. Before the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany transferred between eight and 13\u00a0billion gold marks, which amounted to \"between 4 and 7 percent of total national income\". Ferguson says \"the annuity demanded in 1921 put an intolerable strain on the state's finances\" and that total expenditure between 1920 and 1923 amounted to \"at least 50 percent of Reich revenue, 20 percent of total Reich spending and 10 percent of total public spending\". Thus, Ferguson says, reparations \"undermined confidence in the Reich's creditworthiness\" and \"were therefore excessiveas the German government claimed\"."]}, {"page": "Gold standard", "response": ["The Austrian School asserted that the Great Depression was the result of a credit bust.

According to Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles, the root cause was the concentration of wealth resulting in a stagnating or decreasing standard of living for the poor and middle class. These classes went into debt, producing the credit explosion of the 1920s.

There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled Lies about the Rothschilds abandoned it, saying: 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.'\" He writes that, unlike the court factors of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: \"Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs.\"Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews, p.317. Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in London; however, more recent research by Niall Ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including James Mayer de Rothschild in Paris, Carl Mayer von Rothschild in Naples and Amschel Mayer Rothschild in Frankfurt.The House of Rothschild (Vol. 2): The World's Banker: 1849\u20131999, Niall Ferguson (2000)", "By the start of the 20th century, the introduction of national taxation systems had ended the Rothschild's policy of operating with a single set of commercial account records which resulted in the various branches gradually going their own separate ways as independent banks.
