Marjorie Casebier McCoy finds commonality in tone between the work and Buechner\u2019s tetralogy, The Book of Bebb; she writes that the book is emblematic of \u2018the Bebbsian whimsy that has grasped Buechner\u2019, and that this \u2018enabled him to revivify with angular insight and delightful humor notions that had become far too heavy to convey their \u201cheavenly\u201d meaning\u2019.McCoy, Marjorie Casebier (1988).
