Later followers of the principles of the Brotherhood included Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris and John William Waterhouse.", "As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between Romantic poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters James Collinson and Frederic George Stephens, Rossetti's brother, poet and critic William Michael Rossetti, and  sculptor Thomas Woolner, had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood. Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to The Germ. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including Charles Allston Collins, and Alexander Munro. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.", "* Frederic George Stephens (critic)"]}, {"page": "1907 in literature", "response": ["*March 9 \u2013 Frederic George Stephens, English critic and member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (born 1828)"]}, {"page": "Stephens", "response": ["*Frederic George Stephens (1828\u20131907), British art critic and member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood"]}, {"page": "H.

The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven-member \"brotherhood\".J. Rothenstein, An Introduction to English Painting (I.B.Tauris, 2001), p. 115. The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the mechanistic approach first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. They believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art. Hence the name \"Pre-Raphaelite\". In particular, they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, believing that his broad technique was a sloppy and formulaic form of academic Mannerism. In contrast, they wanted to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art.S.
