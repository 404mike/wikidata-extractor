Rachel Joyce imagines Queenie\u2019s last days as she waits for Harold. Her love has always been undeclared, and in these recounted memories she is more closely involved with David than with him. David steals and declaims her love poems written for/about Harold, steals money from Queenie, fails at Cambridge.

Harold arrives at the hospice and in this story they talk. She sees in the window the shining quartz pendant he brings, her letters of reminiscence have confessed her lifelong love.
