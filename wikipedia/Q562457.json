In 1973, John Wennberg began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced. Through the 1980s, David M. Eddy described errors in clinical reasoning and gaps in evidence. In the mid-1980s, Alvin Feinstein, David Sackett and others published textbooks on clinical epidemiology, which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision-making.

Nightingale applied statistics to nursing, notably with \"Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East\". This statistical study led to advances in sanitation, although the germ theory of disease was not yet fully accepted. The evidence-based design movement began much later in the 1970s with Archie Cochranes's book Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services. to collect, codify, and disseminate \"evidence\" gathered in randomised controlled trials relative to the built environment. A 1984 study by Roger Ulrich found that surgical patients with a view of nature suffered fewer complications, used less pain medication and were discharged sooner than those who looked out on a brick wall; and laid the foundation for what has now become a discipline known as evidence-based design. Studies exist about the psychological effects of lighting, carpeting and noise on critical-care patients, and evidence links physical environment with improvement of patients and staff safety, wellness and satisfaction. Architectural researchers have studied the impact of hospital layout on staff effectiveness, and social scientists studied guidance and wayfinding. Architectural researchers have conducted post-occupancy evaluations (POE) to provide advice on improving building design and quality.

Critical appraisal and synthesis of research findings in a systematic way emerged in 1975 under the term 'meta analysis'. Early syntheses were conducted in broad areas of public policy and social interventions, with systematic research synthesis applied to medicine and health. Inspired by his own personal experiences as a senior medical officer in prisoner of war camps, Archie Cochrane worked to improve how the scientific method was used in medical evidence, writing in 1971: 'the general scientific problem with which we are primarily concerned is that of testing a hypothesis that a certain treatment alters the natural history of a disease for the better'.

Cochrane suggested that because resources would always be limited, they should be used to provide forms of health care which had been shown in properly designed evaluations to be effective.

He advocated smoke-free legislation bringing in the \"smoke-free public spaces, pubs and restaurants\" legislation, and promoted the policy of banning smoking in cars with children present. He led the creation of an integrated public health system, using the model of the three domains of public health practice, creating Public Health Wales and Director of Public Health posts in the Health Boards. During his time the resources for life science research and development increased significantly and  he led the creation of the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (NISCHR) for Wales. He championed cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia with the British Heart Foundation so that Wales became the first UK country to introduce it successfully. He was a strong advocate for government to use legislation to support health improvement measures such as healthy food vending machines in schools and hospitals, smoke-free NHS buildings and grounds, sunbed use legislation, food hygiene scores \"on the doors\", alcohol pricing and supporting cycling and physical activity initiatives. He consistently urged the Welsh Government to address the embedded health inequities in South Wales through long-term investments in housing, education and jobs. He intervened to defuse the Bridgend suicide cluster media response ensuring an all Wales strategic response to suicide prevention. He also advocated the need to increase MMR vaccine uptake given the relatively low rates and during his time there was a steady increase toward target levels. He received the Faculty of Public Health's Alwyn Smith Prize for his leadership as CMO during the 2009 pandemic flu response and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Glamorgan and an Honorary Fellowship from Cardiff Metropolitan University.

A semantic problem, as pointed out by Simon Szreter (2002), is that Public Health is a poorly defined field of medicine in the twilight zone between the responsibility of the state or government and health care provided by physicians and nurses. The drilling of clean water wells, the construction of sewage systems, and legislation resulting in better housing, better education and improved working conditions is in most countries the responsibilities of the state, and it is surely not a good idea to make a public health professional responsible for the drilling, masonry and the enforcement of housing regulation. McKeown was not a politician, and it is quite absurd to hold him responsible for the virtual dismantlement (of public health) during the last 2 decades of the 20th century. McKeown was actively involved in the organisation of medical care in Britain, and he was a frequent advisor for the WHO, and yes, together with Archie Cochrane, he was fairly critical about a wild growth of unevaluated public health interventions and expensive medical care facilities of which the efficacy had not been demonstrated.
