Smith made his Norwich City debut in the 4\u20133 victory over Leicester City, as a second half sub for the two goal hero Wes Hoolahan on 28 September. He made his first start in the 3\u20130 away victory over Bristol City due to the injury to Adam Drury in the warm up on 2 October 2010. Smith is expected to be given an extended run in the team due to Adam Drury's groin injury. Unfortunately, Smith picked up a hip injury in the 2\u20132 draw against Burnley, and was sidelined beyond the new year.
