In the 1990s, she wrote and co-starred in the television film Pat and Margaret (1994), and the sitcom dinnerladies (1998\u20132000), which she also produced. She won two more BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Actress, for her 2006 ITV1 television film, Housewife, 49. Her frequent long-term collaborators included Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, and Anne Reid. In 2006, Wood came tenth in ITV's poll of the British public's 50 Greatest TV Stars.", "The success of the television version of Talent led to Wood writing the follow-up Nearly a Happy Ending.

In 1980 she wrote and starred in the stage play Good Fun.", "Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although Wood was unsure of the project: she only agreed to go ahead if Walters received equal billing.

Wood's friends Celia Imrie, Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge were in the cast. As Seen on TV featured the Acorn Antiques series of sketches, parodying the low-budget soap opera Crossroads, and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. Acorn Antiques is remembered for characters such as \"Mrs Overall\" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie's sarcastic tone as \"Miss Babs\". One of Wood's most popular comic songs, The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's Do It), originated on this show.
