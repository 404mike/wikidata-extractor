It was written by Tony Basgallop and directed by Coky Giedroyc.", "When Tony Basgallop was in Los Angeles, he understood the importance of having a plot which could be reduced to three or four sentences. What Remains was the first whodunit that he had written; in the past he spent most of his career avoiding detective dramas. He commented that \"the key to writing and casting What Remains has been in ensuring that we had the right chemistry between the characters\".", "Caroline Frost, writing for The Huffington Post said:while Broadchurch and Southcliffe tapped into the collective effect of a crime on a tightknit community, What Remains does the opposite \u2013 highlights just how it's possible for people to get lost, and stay very alone, in a big city, where close living conditions no longer mean close neighbours, in fact, often the opposite in our desperate struggle for personal space. Anybody believing a tale like this is ridiculously far-fetched could do worse than watch the moving and disturbing Dreams of a Life starring Zawe Ashton. Equally surprising, and based on a true story. Writer Tony Basgallop confidently juggles the intertwining strands of this onion-layered tale. The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries said \"What Remains breathes new life into cop drama cliches ... he [Tony Basgallop] has made something new from a brace of cop-drama cliches\".", "Gabriel Tate called it \"the latest compelling serial to add to 2013's remarkable roster ... a pleasure to watch such a well-cast ensemble working through such a tightly crafted narrative, while the undertones of isolation and insecurity will be familiar to most big city dwellers. Very promising indeed\" in Time Out. Unreality Primetime said it was \"well written and thought-provoking ... the best murder mystery programme since Broadchurch\". Keith Watson, writing for Metro, said \"What Remains was about loneliness as much as murder\". The New Statesman said:[the series] is clearly intended to be not so much a whodunnit as a why-oh-whydunnit; its writer, Tony Basgallop (Hotel Babylon, Inside Men), seems to be more interested in the way we live now than in weapons and motives. You will have gathered that I think his script strains credulity and that he's very lucky indeed his cast includes the likes of Threlfall and Bamber."]}, {"page": "Basgallop", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Basgallop"]}, {"page": "To the Ends of the Earth (TV series)", "response": ["In 2005 the books were adapted as a BBC drama serial, written in part by the late Leigh Jackson, who fell ill after completing the first film and while working on the second and third.
