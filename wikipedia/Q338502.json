They then maintained that they had exclusive rights to the name and tried to prevent Biff Byford and Saxon's promoters and merchandisers from using the name. Byford applied to the Trade Mark Registry to have the trade mark declared invalid. He applied on the basis that the registration had been obtained in bad faith and that he was entitled to prevent use of the trade mark by bringing an action for 'passing off', that is an action to stop others misrepresenting themselves as Saxon. In 2003, the High Court declared that it was Byford and the current members of the band who owned the name, and were therefore in a position to prevent Oliver and Dawson passing themselves off as Saxon. After this Oliver and Dawson renamed their band Oliver/Dawson Saxon.", "* Graham Oliver \u2013 guitars (1977\u20131996)", "* Rainer H\u00e4nsel \u2013 guitars (1995) \u2013 replaced Graham Oliver on the Dogs of War recording "]}, {"page": "Mike Harding", "response": ["* Plays tenor banjo and harmonica on \"Jump Ararnd\" with The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican, Maartin Allcock, Eliza Carthy, Hugh Whitaker and Graham Oliver, on The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican 2008-2018 (2018, Moon-On-A-Stick Records BSVD008)", "* Plays the voice of The Devil on \"The Devil Went Darn To Barnsley\" with The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican, Maartin Allcock, Eliza Carthy and Graham Oliver, on the album The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican 2008-2018 (2018, Moon-On-A-Stick Records BSVD008)", "* Plays harmonica on \"Wath-On-Dearne Blues\", a cover of one of his own comedy compositions, with The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican, also accompanied by Graham Oliver founder guitarist with heavy metal band Saxon and Barnsley blues singer songwriter Richard Kitson, on the album Cpl.

Although there are extensive liner notes from Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson for each track in the booklet of the CD, sometimes it isn't easy to classify the tracks chronologically. \"Walking\" is - considering the chronology - the first recorded track on this compilation. It was recorded by Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson in 1972, so it might be a recording of the band Blue Condition. The tracks, which are following chronologically, are those from the Tapestry Sessions in early 1976, shortly after the band changed its name from S.O.B. to Son Of A Bitch. These songs are \"Still Fit to Rock 'n' Roll\", the early title of \"Still Fit to Boogie\", \"Ain't You Glad to Be Alive\" and the first version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 1)\" in the booklet and misprinted as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" on the inlay). Then there are the tracks from the Luxemburg sessions in 1978, still recorded under the moniker of Son Of A Bitch. These tracks are \"See the Light Shining\", \"Stand up and Be Counted\", the second version of \"Freeway Mad\" (printed as \"Freeway Mad (Part 2)\" in the booklet and on the inlay), \"Ann Marie\", \"Lift up Your Eyes\" and \"Street Fighting Gang\" (misprinted as \"Street Fighting Man\" in the booklet and on the inlay). Some tracks on the CD are from the period when the band had already changed its name to Saxon. Those are the three live tracks \"Stallions of the Highway\", \"Midnight Rider\" and \"Frozen Rainbow\" with Nigel Glockler on drums, the \"Stone Room Jam\", which was recorded during the mixing of the live album The Eagle Has Landed in 1982 and the Power and the Glory-outtakes \"Turn out the Lights\", \"Coming to the Rescue\" and \"Make 'em Rock\". The studio version of \"Frozen Rainbow\" with Rod Argent on keyboards and the original version of \"Big teaser\" cannot be classified chronologically, but they seem to be recorded, when Saxon still was called Son Of A Bitch. The live version of \"Frozen Rainbow\" is the same, which is released as bonus track on the remastered edition of The Eagle Has Landed, but with a better mix."]}, {"page": "The Eagle Has Landed \u2013 Part II", "response": ["The Eagle Has Landed \u2013 Part II is a double live album by the English heavy metal band Saxon.
