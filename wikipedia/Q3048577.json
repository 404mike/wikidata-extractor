He became harp tutor to several wealthy families, and in about 1790 was made Harp-Master to the Prince of Wales.

In 1802, the harpist Edward Jones of Merionethshire published a book in which he lamented the destructive impact that Christian preachers were having on Welsh folk customs, which they were criticising as sinful. In his view, \"the consequence is, Wales, which was formerly one of the merriest and happiest countries in the World, is now becoming one of the dullest\". Reflecting such a view, in 1852 the Reverend William Roberts, a Baptist minister at Blaenau Gwent, condemned the Mari Lwyd and other related customs as \"a mixture of old Pagan and Popish ceremonies... I wish of this folly, and all similar follies, that they find no place anywhere apart from the museum of the historian and antiquary.\""]}, {"page": "The Ash Grove", "response": ["The first published version of the tune was in 1802 in The Bardic Museum, a book written by the harpist Edward Jones.

At the end of the song, Gwen dies, and in one version of the piece, the writer talks about him mourning and that she is lying neath the shades of the lonely ash grove\". The tune might be much older, as a similar air appears in The Beggar's Opera by John Gay (1728), in the song \"Cease Your Funning\". This was arranged by Beethoven in his Twelve Scottish Songs, WoO 156 No. 5. In 1922, the English folksong collector Frank Kidson claimed that Gay's air derives from the morris dance tune \"Constant Billy\", which is first known in Playford's Dancing Master (1665)."]}, {"page": "Etnika", "response": ["In 1999, researcher Steve Bor\u0121, identified a collection of old Maltese melodies at King's College London.
