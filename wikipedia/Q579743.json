Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even so he had to increase his pace in order to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1\u20130 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

In the first leg against Real Madrid they were comfortably beaten 2-0 and most football pundits then predicted Hamburg were probably out. Hamburg then upset the apple-cart by winning the return leg 5\u20131. Keegan regarded this as one of the most outstanding team performances he had the fortune to be a part of. In the final they played Nottingham Forest. Forest played with 11 men behind the ball, and won the game 1\u20130 with a goal from John Robertson. This cup final defeat was coupled domestically with being beaten to the Bundesliga title by Bayern Munich.
