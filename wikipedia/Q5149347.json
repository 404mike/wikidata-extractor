The French drove in Coalition outposts and secured Napoleon's favoured \"central position\" \u2013 at the junction between Wellington's army to his north-west, and Bl\u00fccher's Prussians to his north-east. Wellington had expected Napoleon to try to envelop the Coalition armies by moving through Mons and to the west of Brussels. Wellington feared that such a move would cut his communications with the ports he relied on for supply. Napoleon encouraged this view with misinformation. Wellington did not hear of the capture of Charleroi until 15:00, because a message from Wellington's intelligence chief, Colquhoun Grant, was delayed by General D\u00f6rnberg. Confirmation swiftly followed in another message from the Prince of Orange. Wellington ordered his army to concentrate around the divisional headquarters, but was still unsure whether the attack in Charleroi was a feint and the main assault would come through Mons. Wellington only determined Napoleon's intentions with certainty in the evening, and his orders for his army to muster near Nivelles and Quatre Bras were sent out just before midnight."]}, {"page": "Colquhoun", "response": ["* Colquhoun Grant, British army officer of the Peninsular War"]}, {"page": "Sharpe's Sword", "response": ["References are made to incidents during the Peninsular War and the 1812 Battle of Salamanca.
