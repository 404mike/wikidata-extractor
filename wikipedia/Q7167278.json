The first was a friendly match at home to local rivals Portsmouth on 20 October 1921, which served as a benefit match for club secretary Ernest Arnfield. The Saints won the game 4\u20130, with all four goals coming in the second half \u2013 Arthur Dominy \"walked the ball into the net\" for the first, John Horton headed in a cross from Fred Foxall for the second, Foxall \"completed a solo run\" for the third, and Horton scored a second near the end of the game. The two sides met again just over a month later, with Fratton Park hosting a friendly to raise money for the Unemployment District Relief Fund. The game was much more even than the meeting at The Dell, with Percy Cherrett scoring the only goal to give Pompey the win."]}]}}
