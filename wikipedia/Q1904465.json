In his first two seasons, he made the cut in slightly more than half the events and recorded two top-10s. In 1990, his third season, would be a marked improvement. He recorded the best result of his career at the first event of the year, the Atlantic Open held in Porto, Portugal. S\u00f8rensen entered the fourth round in second place. With the collapse of overnight leader Ronald Stelten, an American player, S\u00f8rensen took a two shot lead to the 71st hole. He would falter down the stretch, however, and wind up in a six-way playoff. On the first playoff hole, in gale-force winds, he and four other competitors would make bogey or worse; Stephen McAllister's par won the event. Despite the disappointing finish, he would go on to his best year. He would make the cut in 21 of 26 events including that year's Open Championship. He finished a career-best 40th on the Order of Merit.", "| Richard Boxall, \u00a0Stephen Hamill, Stephen McAllister,  Ronan Rafferty, David Williams"]}, {"page": "EGA Trophy", "response": ["*1983 Neil Anderson, David Gilford, Craig Laurence, Lindsay Mann, Paul Mayo, Stephen McAllister, Maurice Moir, Roger Roper, Ernie Wilson"]}, {"page": "1983 European Amateur Team Championship", "response": ["|Frank Coutts, Colin Dalgleish, George MacGregor, Lindsay Mann,  Stephen McAllister, J.A.
