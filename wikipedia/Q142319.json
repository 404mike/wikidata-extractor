It was recognized in 1977 by FIDE as the World Championship for Cadets for players under 17 and attracted for example Garry Kasparov. In 1981 the age limit was reduced to under 16, applicable at the start of the year the championship is played in.

The value of the king is undefined as it cannot be captured, let alone traded, during the course of the game. Chess engines usually assign the king an arbitrary large value such as 200 points or more to indicate that the inevitable loss of the king due to checkmate trumps all other considerations . In the endgame, where there is usually little danger of checkmate, the fighting value of the king is about four points .  In the endgame, a king is more powerful than a minor piece but less powerful than a rook.  Julian Hodgson also puts its value at four points . The king is good at attacking and defending nearby pieces and pawns. It is better at defending such pieces than the knight is, and it is better at attacking them than the bishop is .
