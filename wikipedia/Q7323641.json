It was there where he first demonstrated his flair for design when his insisted that his staff should all wear a different colour each day and sit next to each other so their clothes and the editorial floor were colour-coordinated. When the title went bankrupt he got a job as a reporter on Marketing Week where he remained for two years.

While on the Express he regularly invited the paper's astrologer Jonathan Cainer to join editorial conferences to give them an added perspective.
