He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in Wales brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that \"it was not right to kill insects\" for his collections, and he had to find dead ones. He read Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne and took up birdwatching. Eras took an interest in chemistry and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to crystallography. When Eras went on to a medical course at the University of Cambridge, Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname \"Gas\". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a poco curante (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at Maer in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the Wedgwoods. His exasperated father once told him off, saying \"You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.\""]}, {"page": "John Allen Wedgwood", "response": ["On 29 January 1839, he officiated at the wedding of his cousins Charles Darwin and Emma Wedgwood in an Anglican ceremony arranged to also suit the Unitarians in St Peter's Church at Maer Hall.
