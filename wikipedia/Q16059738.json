The North, captained by WG's long-time rival A. N. Hornby, won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 287, WG taking six for 89 and Fred one for 53 (Hornby scored 103). The South were 6 for one at close of play on Thursday. WG, who opened the innings, went on to make 77 on Friday morning, sharing a third wicket partnership of 122 with Isaac Walker. When he was out, Fred came in to join Walker and came of age as a cricketer. They shared a stand of 294 for the fourth wicket, broken when Walker was out for 179. There was then something of a collapse as the South went from 430 for four to 482 all out just before the close. Fred scored 189 not out and that remained his career-highest innings. On the final day, the North managed to avoid the innings defeat and amassed 289 (WG three for 83; Fred two for 61) to ensure a draw.Gentlemen of the North v Gentlemen of the South \u2013 scorecard Prior to this match, Grace's highest score was 33.

He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Jupp, Humphrey, Isaac Walker and James Lillywhite but they all played many more innings than he did. He was 11th in the list of wicket-takers but again he bowled relatively few overs compared with most of those above him.
