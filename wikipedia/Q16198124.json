He was born into an artistic family: on his father's side, his uncle was the artist Richard Dadd; on his mother's side, his maternal grandfather was the engraver John Greenaway, and his aunt was the illustrator Kate Greenaway.Dadd studied at the Slade School of Fine Art 1900 to 1903, and he became a staff artist at The Sphere magazine. He illustrated the 1904 book William Tell Told Again by P. G. Wodehouse, accompanied by verses written by John W. Houghton.\nHis work was included in several public exhibitions before 1914, at the Royal Academy, Brook Street Art Gallery, the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.  \nAfter the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in December 1915 as a private in the 16th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment.  He served on the Western Front in France.  On 12 August 1916, Dadd's illustration of a British gas sentry ringing a medieval church bell to alert troops of a German gas attack appeared on the cover of The Sphere.The illustration had been published posthumously: Dadd was killed in France on 2 August 1916.  He is buried in the Maroeuil British Cemetery near Arras.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904 in literature", "response": ["*P. G. Wodehouse (prose), John W.

The main prose element was written by P. G. Wodehouse, while Philip Dadd supplied the frontispiece and 15 full-page illustrations, all in colour. The 15 illustrations were each accompanied by a verse written by John W. Houghton, who also wrote the prologue and epilogue in verse.", "Regarding the book in the context of Wodehouse's works, Evelyn Waugh wrote in 1961, \"Collectors prize as bibliographical rarities such early works as William Tell Told Again and Swoop, but it is impossible to discern in them any promise of what was to come.\" However, Barry Phelps, in his book P. G. Wodehouse: Man and Myth (1992), held a different view of both William Tell Told Again and The Swoop!: \"Both books are early Wodehouse, writing rapidly for cash rather than art, giving them an exuberant, uninhibited freshness. He clearly enjoyed writing them and they are a marker for what is to come.\" In his 2003 book Plum Sauce: A P. G. Wodehouse Companion, Richard Usborne described William Tell Told Again: \"A short, cheerful narrative by Wodehouse, excellent colour pictures by Philip Dadd and excellent verse captions to the pictures, by John W. Houghton \u2013\u00a0very much the sort of expert verse Wodehouse himself was already writing, in Punch and elsewhere.\""]}, {"page": "Phillip Dadd", "response": ["#redirect Philip Dadd "]}, {"page": "Dadd", "response": ["* Philip Dadd (1880-1916), British illustrator"]}]}}
