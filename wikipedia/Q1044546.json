Bailyn informed his audience that \"recent revisionist writings on eighteenth-century America are voluminous. The main points of reinterpretation will be found in the following books and articles, to which specific reference is made in the paragraphs that follow: Robert E. Brown, 'Middle-Class Democracy and the Revolution in Massachusetts, 1691-1780' (Ithaca, N. Y., 1955); E.

Morris, 'The Confederation Period and the American Historian,' William and Mary Quarterly, XIII (Apr. 1956), 139-56.\" In the body of his article, Bailyn mentioned that \"Caroline Robbins' recent book, The Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman (1959), suggests, that the commonwealth radicalism of seventeenth-century England continued to flow to the colonists, blending, ultimately, with other strains of thought to form a common body of advanced theory.\" Richard Hofstadter's 1963 lecture on \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics,\" published in the November 1964 Harper's Magazine, was not cited in The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution, but Bailyn and Hofstadter corresponded on their respective projects. Bailyn's student, Gordon S. Wood, later critiqued Hofstadter's limited treatment of an eighteenth-century \"paranoid style.\"", "Of course, during the Second World War and more than a decade before contributions to this research field by both Arendt and Pocock, literati Zera S. Fink demonstrated that Polybian and Machiavellian ideas, the latter primarily in il Discorsi, had been transmitted into (what Fink described as) \"the classical republican\" minds of seventeenth-century England--one in particular, Fink averred, was none other than James Harrington. Both Arendt and Pocock claimed that Fink's 1945 book on a \"Venetian vogue\" for \"stability\" by \"mixed government,\" and the 1942 article in which Fink examined il Discorsi passages translated and quoted in the works of James Harrington, partially germinated their research. Arendt, for instance, was quite explicitly \"indebted to Zera Fink's important study The Classical Republicans...for the influence of Machiavelli upon Harrington and the influence of the ancients upon seventeenth-century English thought, see the excellent study by Zera S. Fink.\" Pocock likewise credited Fink for beginning a study on Englishmen \"impressed by the stability of Venetian constitutional reforms\" and the classical ideas that spawned such reforms. Pocock wished to further research and elaborate on this project: \"...what I propose to do is investigate the significance in the eighteenth century of a current of ideas that stems mainly from James Harrington, but can be traced additionally to the seventeenth-century theorists studied some years ago by Z. S. Fink under the name of the 'classical republicans'...[Caroline Robbins' Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman illustrated] how regularly recourse was made, throughout the century, to a group of writers essentially the same as Fink's Venetian theorists.\"", "Douglass Adair, who spearheaded the third series of The William and Mary Quarterly, sat on the WMQ editorial board, along with Bernard Bailyn and Caroline Robbins, that accepted Gordon S. Wood's \"Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution\" for publication. In the 1940s, Adair authored previous essays on what he deemed \"republican\" thought,"]}, {"page": "Robbins (name)", "response": ["* Caroline Robbins (1903\u20131999), British historian "]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 1999", "response": ["*Caroline Robbins, 95, British historian."]}, {"page": "Stephen J.
