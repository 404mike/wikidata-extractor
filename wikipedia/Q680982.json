The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterwards, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court."]}, {"page": "William IV", "response": ["William was born in the early hours of the morning on 21 August 1765 at Buckingham House, the third child and son of King George\u00a0III and Queen Charlotte.Ziegler, p. 12.
