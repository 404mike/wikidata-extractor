In India, William Muir founded the Indian Christian village Muirabad, near Allahabad. Muir was impressed with the discovery of the Apology of al-Kindy; he lectured on it at the Royal Asiatic Society, presenting it as an important link in what he saw as a chain of notable conversions to Christianity, and later he published the translated sources.

What appealed to Gordon was that these men were able to find a balance between tradition and modern advancements, reconciling the conflicts the two seemed to pose. Scientific advancements and biblical criticism could be acknowledged without sacrificing what they saw to be the core of Christianity: the need for salvation and the preaching of personal conversion. Alexander Whyte, in particular, influenced Gordon's struggle with Higher Criticism by reminding him, \"You are to be a minister, see that you feed your people. Never mind your theological, your scientific, your higher critical problems. Keep them for your study.\"Alexander Whyte, as quoted in Marshall, David Brian. Secularizing the Faith Canadian Protestant Clergy and the Crisis of Belief, 1850-1940. Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1992, 118.
