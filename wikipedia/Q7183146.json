Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016\u201317, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be a vote in the autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017\u201318 year. Several universities have already advertised fees of \u00a39,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing. In October 2017, the Prime Minister Theresa May announced that tuition fees would be temporarily frozen at \u00a39,250. In 2018, this temporary freeze remains in place and it is likely to be extended as a university funding review is carried out.
