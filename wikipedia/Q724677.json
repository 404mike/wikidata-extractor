The Hunterian method was inherently simpler and extensible to several Indic scripts because it systematized grapheme transliteration, and it came to prevail and gain government and academic acceptance. Opponents of the grapheme transliteration model continued to mount unsuccessful attempts at reversing government policy until the turn of the century, with one critic calling appealing to \"the Indian Government to give up the whole attempt at scientific (i.e. Hunterian) transliteration, and decide once and for all in favour of a return to the old phonetic spelling.\""]}, {"page": "Syed Ahmad Khan", "response": ["In August 1871 William Wilson Hunter, a Scottish historian and member of the Indian Civil Service published Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel Against the Queen? in which he discussed the Indian Wahabi movement, it\u2019s role in the rebellionAli 1980 and argued that the Muslims were a threat to the Empire.Fuerst, p. 11 Hunter links Wahhabism with rebellion and terms them as self-stylised jihadis.Kidwai 2020, p. 182 His accusations led to the prosecution of Muslims in India especially in the North Western Provinces and those associated with Wahhabism were severely punished.Kidwai 2020, p. 182 Many Muslims found his arguments one-sided and this prompted Sir Syed to write a  rejoinder of the book.Kidwai 2020, p. 182 He reviewed the book in The Pioneer in a series of articles which were reprinted in Aligarh Institute Gazette from November 24, 1871 to February 23, 1872.Sherwani 1944 They were later collected and published in a book in England by Hafiz Ahmad Hasan, the Vakil of Tonk.Shan Muhammad 1973, p. 65 Sir Syed based his arguments upon the Prophet\u2019s own conduct during holy wars.Kidwai 2020, p. 98"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Sir William Wilson Hunter, K.C.S.I., historian, Indologist"]}, {"page": "Charles James O'Donnell", "response": ["He was appointed assistant to the Director General of Statistics William Wilson Hunter in 1875 but returned to district work as a joint magistrate in 1884.
