As a result, a closed loop in the family of smooth cubic surfaces determines a permutation of the 27 lines. The group of permutations of the 27 lines arising this way is called the monodromy group of the family of cubic surfaces. A remarkable 19th-century discovery was that the monodromy group is neither trivial nor the whole symmetric group S_{27}; it is a group of order 51840, acting transitively on the set of lines. This group was gradually recognized (by \u00c9lie Cartan (1896), Arthur Coble (1915-17), and Patrick du Val (1936)) as the Weyl group of type E_6, a group generated by reflections on a 6-dimensional real vector space, related to the Lie group E_6 of dimension 78."]}, {"page": "Cheadle Hulme", "response": ["Actors and actresses from the area include Tim McInnerny, best known for his roles in Blackadder as Lord Percy and Captain Darling, and Kirsten Cassidy, best known for playing Tanya Young in Grange Hill.
