The two opened up a big gap with a chase pack of a Guatemalan, the other 2 Russians, other 2 Chinese.  By the end of 8K the pack began to lose walkers, Mirna Ort\u00edz and  Johanna Jackson were disqualified, and Liu began to lose contact, Kaniskina off on her own.  Shortly after the half way mark, the pack was down to Elena Lashmanova and Anisya Kirdyapkina leading  Xiuzhi Lu and Shenjie Qieyang  An hour into the race and Lu began to lose contact, Lashmanova, Kirdyapkina and Qieyang chasing and then swallowing up Liu.  By 14\u00a0km Kaniskina had a 33-second lead.   Almost unnoticeable, the gap between Kaniskina and the chasers had come down to 24 seconds at 16\u00a0km, Kirdyapkina and then Liu struggling to stay with the group.  After another 2K lap, the gap was down to 17 seconds at 18\u00a0km, still seemingly insurmountable with just one lap to go.  With Kaniskina looking strong, the gap kept falling.  Kaniskina started to show the strain, as the pass became inevitable she began the most pronounced arm swing trying to find that last bit of speed, but it wasn't enough.  Less than 200 metres from the finish Lashmanova went by Kaniskina and on to the gold carpet.  Lashmanova finished with a 1:25:02 world record.  Broken Kaniskina finished 7 seconds back, just a second slower than the previous world record.  Qieyang happily finished another 7 seconds later for bronze.  After the finish, Kaniskina was barely able to walk, while a fresh Lashmanova celebrated her victory."]}, {"page": "2011 European Race Walking Cup", "response": ["|align=center|  12 || Johanna Jackson ||  || 1:33:53"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["|Johanna Jackson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|style=\"border-right:double\"|Johanna Jackson"]}, {"page": "2011 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 20 kilometres walk", "response": ["| 20 || align=\"left\" | Johanna Jackson || align=\"left\" |  || 1:35:32  ||"]}, {"page": "2012 Challenge Cup", "response": ["The draw, which took place at 3:00pm on 16 April 2012 had an Olympic and Paralympic theme with the last 16 teams drawn by two athletes who were hoping for medal success at London 2012, Johanna Jackson and Louis Speight.
