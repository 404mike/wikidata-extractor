He then toured with the Lene Lovich band on the Stiff Records \"Be Stiff Route 78 Tour\" of the UK and New York.\nFrom 1978 to 1981, Fran\u00e7ois worked with ex-Strutters Mark Kjeldsen and Bobbi (Irwin) Trehern, on a project they named the Sinceros. They went on to make two albums for Epic Records, The Sound of Sunbathing and Pet Rock, and achieved moderate success before they disbanded in 1981.\nFran\u00e7ois continued playing sessions while remaining with Epic Records, releasing a solo single \"If You Love Me\", before joining the Teardrop Explodes for their Wilder album tour, which took place in the UK, Europe, Australia and the US. He also features on the 1984 Julian Cope solo album World Shut Your Mouth.\nIn 1984, Fran\u00e7ois played bass guitar on the album This Island with Eurogliders. Produced by Nigel Gray in his Oxfordshire studio, the album included the top ten single \"Heaven (Must Be There)\". Fran\u00e7ois left the UK to live and work in Australia. He played bass and synthesizer on the Eurogliders next LP, Absolutely. The album was in the charts for 47 weeks and spawned three Australian top ten singles, including \"The City of Soul\" which featured Fran\u00e7ois' trademark funky bass techniques.\nParting company with Eurogliders in 1987, Fran\u00e7ois formed the power pop trio Panic Poets, who released the independent single \"Let's Go\" in Australia in 1988, gaining good airplay.\nIn recent years, Fran\u00e7ois has collaborated on several albums with West Australian percussionist Murray Campbell, as part of Campbell's Beatworld project. Now living in New South Wales, Fran\u00e7ois is still very much involved in songwriting and production with local artists at his recording studio (Point Studio) on the Central Coast.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eurogliders", "response": ["* Ron Fran\u00e7ois\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (1982\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Stateless (Lene Lovich album)", "response": ["* Ron Fran\u00e7ois \u2013 bass, percussion, vocals"]}, {"page": "The Sinceros", "response": ["Mark Kjeldsen, Bobby Irwin and Ron Fran\u00e7ois first played together in a London R&B band called The Strutters."]}, {"page": "The Sound of Sunbathing", "response": ["#\"Good Luck (To You)\" (Lyrics and Music by Ron Fran\u00e7ois)", "#\"Good Luck (To You)\" (Lyrics and Music by Ron Fran\u00e7ois)", "*Ron Fran\u00e7ois - bass guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Pet Rock (album)", "response": ["#\"Nothing Changes\" (Lyrics and music by Ron Fran\u00e7ois)", "#\"Girl I Realise\" (Lyrics and music by Ron Fran\u00e7ois)", "#\"As the World Turns\" (Lyrics and music by Ron Fran\u00e7ois)", "*Ron Fran\u00e7ois - bass guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Ron Francois", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Fran\u00e7ois"]}, {"page": "This Island (Eurogliders album)", "response": ["The album had a lengthy recording process.

In July of that year, the band travelled to the UK, replaced Saunders with Ron Fran\u00e7ois, and recorded its second studio album, This Island. Released in May 1984, the album peaked at No. 4 on the Australian albums chart, and was therefore the most successful of Eurogliders' studio albums. The third single, \"Heaven (Must Be There)\", also released in May 1984, turned out to be Eurogliders' most successful single. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian singles chart, and also charted in New Zealand, Canada and the USA. Once again, Villepastour starred in the audiovisual presentation of the single: this time, she 'played' tubular bells, and was also the keyboardist, in the Countdown video."]}]}}
