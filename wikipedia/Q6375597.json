This was due to a flourishing tradition of folk dance, mummers plays and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. It was thus a rich and convenient place for the collectors of the first folk song revival, including Kate Lee, Lucy Broadwood and W. P. Merrick.W. P. Merrick, Folk Songs from Sussex (English Folk Dance and Song Society, 1953). Sussex material was used by the composers of the English pastoral school, for example in Percy Grainger\u2019s arrangement of \u2018The Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol\u2019, Ralph Vaughan Williams' use of the tune \u2018Monk's Gate\u2019 as a setting for John Bunyan\u2019s \u2018To be a Pilgrim\u2019 and George Butterworth\u2019s arrangement of 'Folk Songs from Sussex'.J. R. Watson, T. Dudley-Smith, An Annotated Anthology of Hymns (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 108. Most important of the collector's sources were the Copper Family of Rottingdean, who emerged as authorities on folk song and eventually as major recording artists.Copper Family Website, http://www.thecopperfamily.com/index.html, retrieved 13/02/09. Sussex folk song also had a formative effect on one of the major figures of the second revival, as it was as a child of five in Sussex that A. L. Lloyd first heard folk music.E. D. Gregory, 'A. L. Lloyd and the English Folk Song Revival, 1934\u201344', Canadian Journal for Traditional Music (1997). Other performers include Scan Tester, Henry Burstow and the sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins. Sussex songs were also the foundation of the repertoire of the influential Young Tradition.Obituaries, 'Bob Copper', 1 April 2004, The Independent, .

The village also had home-grown talent of significance, notably the Copper Family who maintained a long tradition of English folk song, performing for the collector Kate Lee as early as 1892. Its best-known member was Bob Copper (1915\u20132004), also known as a writer.

Contralto, composer, and festival organizer Mary Augusta Wakefield was another early member. In 1904 she became the Honorary Secretary, following the illness and subsequent death of her predecessor in the post, Kate Lee, and her diary records that she held a meeting with Cecil Sharp and Ralph Vaughan Williams to plan for the resurrection of the Society and \"fan its dying embers\". Their work was evidently successful as the Society continued in existence until its amalgamation with the English Folk Dance Society in 1932, which gave rise to the English Folk Dance and Song Society, which exists to this day. Broadwood also took on the mantle of Editor of the Folk Song Journal at this time. Although her Secretaryship of the Society was to last for only a short while, she retained her post as editor of the Journal (with the exception of a very short period of relinquishment) until her resignation from the work in 1926. Her work as Editor, and her research scholarship were recognised internationally, and, in his subsequent obituary of her, Vaughan Williams (amongst others) noted that it was principally her work which had ensured the existence and revival of the Society."]}, {"page": "English Folk Dance and Song Society", "response": ["The Folk-Song Society, founded in London in 1898,Keel, Frederick (1948).
