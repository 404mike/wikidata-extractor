Frank Besant. She had an older brother named Arthur Besant. When her father and mother separated, she was to be under the custody of her mother, but in 1878 her father went to the High Court and won the case for custody. It was not until she was 21 that she returned to her mother.In 1892 Mabel married a journalist named Ernest Scott at Marylebone, London. They emigrated to Australia where she had a daughter, Muriel and became a Roman Catholic. She returned to England with Muriel in 1909 but Scott did not sue for divorce until 1915. For some time she assisted her mother in both British Co-Masonry and the Theosophical Society Adyar.\nAfter her mother's death, Mabel Besant-Scott briefly became the head of the British Federation of Co-Freemasonry and held the highest thirty third degree in Scottish Rite Freemasonry. In 1933 she visited India where her mother died and met the Avatar Meher Baba, where they discussed her mother resurrecting as a man in India. She wrote several articles for The Aydar Bulletin, a periodical of the Theosophical Society based in Adyar, India. A year later she abruptly resigned from Co-Freemasonry, joining the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship shortly afterwards and taking with her some of her followers from Co-Masonry. She was one of the most active members of this Rosicrucian theatre near Christchurch, which was led by George Alexander Sullivan.In The Rebirth of Witchcraft by Doreen Valiente and Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions by James R.

In 1938, also on Catherine Chalk's land, they built Christchurch Garden Theatre, which called itself \u201cThe First Rosicrucian Theater in England.\u201d It presented Sullivan's mystically-themed plays during June\u2013September 1938. Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the reviver of British witchcraft (\u201cWicca\u201d), claimed to have been initiated into traditional witchcraft through contacts he made at the rosicrucian theatre, though there is some debate about this. Gerald Gardner\u2019s biography by Jack Bracelin (although said by Frederic Lamond to have been written by Idries Shah) mentions the group. Although the group named itself after the Rosicrucian tradition, and although its rituals had a Masonic flavour to them, the teachings of George Alexander Sullivan \u2014 at least as given by Peter Caddy \u2014 resemble most of all the teachings of the New Thought movement.

However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, George Alexander Sullivan, believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met a group of people within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of Freemasonry known as Co-Masonry, who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the Rosicrucian Order when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, Mabel Besant-Scott, had done so.Bracelin 1960. pp. 164\u2013166. The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and Theosophy, and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton.Heselton 2000. pp. 100\u2013112.
