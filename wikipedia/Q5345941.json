He was educated at a private school and then entered a business house at Manchester. He went to London and in 1842 emigrated to Australia. He at first had a small property on the northern outskirts of Melbourne but in 1844, in partnership with James S. Johnston, took up a cattle station near Dandenong, Victoria. About the year 1847 he bought The Argus from William Kerr, incorporated with it The Patriot, and five years later absorbed another journal, The Daily News.\nIn the early days of the gold-rush the paper was produced under great difficulties, but the circulation kept increasing, and it became a valuable property. Wilson strenuously opposed the influx of convicts from Tasmania, fought for the separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales, and opposed Governor Charles Hotham in his attitude to the miners; but when the rebellion broke out he took the stand that there were peaceable and legitimate methods of obtaining redress. When Charles Gavan Duffy came to Victoria and went into politics Wilson sent him a list of suggested reforms which included justice to the Aborigines, the organizing of agriculture as a department of the state, the introduction of the ballot into municipal elections, and the leasing of crown lands for cultivation with the right of ultimate purchase. He was the first to raise the cry \"unlock the lands\". He was in fact a thorough democrat in sentiment, and an ardent reformer. Costs of running the Argus had increased and Wilson was close to ruin, but was saved when Lauchlan Mackinnon bought a partnership from James Gill, and took over management.In 1857 finding he was losing his eyesight Wilson paid a long visit to England, but in 1858-9 travelled through Australia and New Zealand and wrote a series of sketches for The Argus, published in London in 1859 under the title, Rambles in the Antipodes, with two maps and 12 illustrations by Samuel Thomas Gill. He took much interest in Acclimatization, founded the Acclimatization Society in Melbourne in 1861, and was its first president. In the same year he visited Sydney and started the Acclimatization Society of New South Wales.\nWilson finally settled in 1864 at Hayes, Bromley in England, and lived at Hayes Place the life of an English country gentleman farming 300 acres. He occasionally contributed to The Times and the Fortnightly Review; an article from this journal, Principles of Representation, was published as a pamphlet in 1866. Another pamphlet, on Acclimatization, was printed in 1875. He died at Hayes on 10 January 1878 and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery on 7 July. The bulk of his estate was used to form the Edward Wilson Trust which since his death has distributed several million dollars to Victorian charities, in particular the Melbourne, Alfred and Children's hospitals in Victoria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burke and Wills expedition", "response": ["* Edward Wilson, Editor of the Argus"]}, {"page": "Edward Wilson", "response": ["Edward Wilson may refer to:", "*Edward Wilson, clergyman and the founder of Wilson's School, originally in Camberwell, London", "*Edward Wilson (MP) (1719\u20131764), English MP for Westmorland", "*Edward Wilson (actor) (1947\u20132008), English actor and theatre director", "*Edward Wilson (engineer) (1820\u20131877), railway engineer in England", "*Edward Wilson (journalist) (1813\u20131878), 19th-century Australian journalist", "*Edward Wilson (novelist), 21st century British writer of spy novels", "*Tay Wilson (Tennant Edward Wilson, 1925\u20132014), member of the International Olympic Committee from New Zealand", "*Edward Wilson, the character played by Matt Damon in The Good Shepherd"]}, {"page": "Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)", "response": ["Edward Wilson, visiting the lake in the 1850s described it as follows: \"Lake Alexandrina is the finest sheet of fresh water I ever saw. Indeed so formidable did it look, with a stiff wind blowing up quite a sufficient swell to make one seasick, that I could scarcely believe it to be fresh. Such is the fact however. It is forty or fifty miles long by twelve or fifteen wide and the shores around it receded into the dim distance until they become invisible, in the way which we are accustomed only with ideas of salt water. Supplied almost entirely by the Murray, the whole lake retains the muddy tinge of which I have spoken, and this sadly detracts from the otherwise beautiful appearances of this magnificent sheet of water.\""]}, {"page": "The Argus (Melbourne)", "response": ["The first edition was published on 2 June 1846.

In 1859 Mr. Edward Wilson selected Gill to illustrate his book, Rambles in the Antipodes. He also procured a major commission from the Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library in 1869, to reproduce 40 of his earlier watercolours of life on the Victorian goldfields. At the same time as the Melbourne Public Library commission, Gill prepared a largely identical set of 53 watercolours under the title drawing of The Goldfields of Victoria During 1852\u201353.

A meeting was held on January 21, 1859, at the London Tavern on Bishopsgate Street. The attendees included Professor Richard Owen at the head of the table and the servings included a large pike, American partridges, a young bean goose and an African eland. At the meeting Mitchell and others suggested that many of these exotic animals could live in the British wilderness. Professor Owen wrote in the newspapers later on the taste of the eland and the need for animal introductions. On June 26, 1860, another meeting was held and the Acclimatisation Society was formally founded in London and a year later the Secretary to the Society, Frank Buckland, a popular naturalist known for his taste in exotic meats, noted the \"success\" of the Society in introducing peafowl, common pheasant, swan, starling and linnet into Australia through the efforts of Edward Wilson. One of the supporters of the Society was Miss Burdett Coutts. Other such societies spread quickly around the world, particularly to European colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. In many instances they existed both as societies for the study of natural history as well as to improve the success rate of introduced species. In 1850, English sparrows were introduced into America and Eugene Schieffelin introduced starlings in 1890 as part of a plan to introduce all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["** Charles Edward Wilson (rugby player and soldier) (1871\u20131914), British military officer and rugby union player", "** Charles Edward Wilson (General Electric executive) (1886\u20131972), CEO of GE and member of the Truman Administration", "* Edward Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "** Edward Wilson (MP) (c. 1719\u20131764), English MP for Westmorland", "** Edward Wilson (journalist) (1813\u20131878), 19th-century Australian journalist", "** Edward Wilson (engineer) (1820\u20131877), engineer and architect in Worcester, England", "** Edward Wilson (actor) (1947\u20132008), English actor and theatre director", "** Edward Wilson (novelist), 21st-century British writer of spy novels", "*** Richard Edward Wilson (born 1941), American composer", "*** William Edward Wilson (astronomer) (1851\u20131908), Irish astronomer"]}, {"page": "Edward Williams (Victorian judge)", "response": [" Williams later represented Edward Wilson (who had bought The Argus from Kerr) and James Johnston against another libel suit brought by Moor.

About this time he went into partnership with Edward Wilson in a cattle station near Dandenong, Victoria but the venture did not pay, and the partnership was dissolved, Johnston persuading Wilson to take to literary pursuits. Subsequently the two purchased the Melbourne Argus in equal co-partnership. The new venture did not at first pay better than the cattle station, and in 1852 Johnston sold his share to James Gill, who resold it to Lauchlan Mackinnon, whose interests Johnston subsequently represented in the management of the Argus when Mackinnon went to Europe."]}, {"page": "Lauchlan Mackinnon", "response": ["In Australia Mackinnon at once engaged in the hazardous business of \"overlanding\", and succeeded in his dangerous mission of conveying stock from Sydney to Adelaide\u2014a feat which attracted much attention at the time, as it was the first overland journey made between these distant points. A little later (in 1840) he made one of the earliest overland journeys with sheep from Sydney to Melbourne. The pastoral capabilities of the country attracted his attention, and he determined to settle in Australia Felix. He took up a run in the western district on the Loddon River, and subsequently removed to Mount Fyans. He was for some years associated in business with the late James Montgomery, and in 1852 he joined Edward Wilson, and became one of the proprietors of the Argus. Prior to this he had taken a prominent part in political life, particularly interesting himself in the agitation for the separation of Port Phillip District from New South Wales. He was one of the representatives for the Electoral district of Port Phillip in the Parliament of New South Wales in 1848, and vigorously supported its claims for justice from the governing authorities of New South Wales. He was a strong and earnest supporter of the anti-convict movement, and took a prominent part in the demonstration which was held in Melbourne in 1849, when the inhabitants resolved to oppose the landing of convicts from the ship Randolph by physical force, and to undergo any extremity of suffering rather than permit the colony to become a receptacle of felons.", "After separation had been secured, Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool district in the old unicameral Victorian Legislative Council, and assisted to pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted offenders into the colony. He energetically combated the efforts of the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the police force of Port Phillip\u2014a position which, however, he did not accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. In 1864 he was nominated to serve on the Hawthorn Council, and elected as the Mayor. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his first wife being a daughter of Robert Montgomery, and sister of James Montgomery; and his second, Emily, daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Melbourne General Cemetery", "response": ["* Edward Wilson (1913\u20131878), journalist"]}]}}
