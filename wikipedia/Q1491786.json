While several studios, including New Line Cinema, expressed interest, progress was slow. Rachel Talalay's stepdaughter gave her a Tank Girl comic to read while she was shooting her directorial debut film, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (released in 1991). Talalay read the comic between takes and became interested in directing a Tank Girl film. She contacted Astor and, after hearing nothing for almost a year, was about to give up trying to secure the rights when he gave her permission to make the film. Talalay pitched the film to Amblin Entertainment and Columbia Pictures, which both turned it down. Talalay turned down an offer from Disney, as she did not believe the studio would allow the levels of violence and the sexual references the plot required. An offer from MGM was accepted. Talalay worked closely with the Tank Girl comic's co-creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett during the film's production, and selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer. The studio was unhappy with Hardwicke, who was relatively unknown at the time, being chosen over more experienced designers, and Talalay had to meet with the producers to persuade them to allow Hardwicke to work on the project. Tedi Sarafian wrote the screenplay and Gale Tattersall was chosen as cinematographer. Believing that MGM would not allow the depiction of a bestial relationship in the film, the romance between Tank Girl and Booga was only written into the second or third version of the script, after the character was already established in the minds of people involved in the production. By this stage, Booga: \"was a character and not just a kangaroo [so] it wasn't an issue anymore.\""]}, {"page": "2006 American Society of Cinematographers Awards", "response": ["** Gale Tattersall \u2013 House (Episode: \"Meaning\")"]}, {"page": "Tattersall", "response": ["* Gale Tattersall (born 1948), British-American film maker and cinematographer"]}, {"page": "Newton Thomas Sigel", "response": ["|Gale Tattersall"]}, {"page": "2008 American Society of Cinematographers Awards", "response": ["** Gale Tattersall \u2013 House (Episode: \"House's Head\")"]}, {"page": "Lockdown (House)", "response": ["Director of photography Gale Tattersall used Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras to film"]}, {"page": "Help Me (House)", "response": ["After successfully using the cameras for scenes on the episode \"Lockdown\" director of photography Gale Tattersall convinced producers to film an entire episode using the cameras.
