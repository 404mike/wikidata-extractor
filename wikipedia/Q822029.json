The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience). Initially, the band rehearsed in Jonny Buckland's bedroom in a flat, with neighbours who were able to tolerate the noise.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  The band finally settled on the name \"Coldplay\", which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.", "thumb|Coldplay performing at the ALTer EGO concert in January 2020|220x220pxOn 23 October 2019, the album tracks were revealed in advertisements in the band members local newspapers in the UK, including north Wales' Daily Post (with whom Jonny Buckland once had a holiday job), and Exeter's Express & Echo (the newspaper of Chris Martin's hometown). \"Orphans\" and \"Arabesque\" were then released as the album's lead singles on 24 October 2019 on the Annie Mac show on BBC Radio 1, with the latter song being the first Coldplay song to feature profanity.

During an interview for YouTube in 2019, lead vocalist Chris Martin described their way of making songs as \"a series of doors\" where he usually brings initial ideas to guitarist Jonny Buckland, who either disapprove them or give his input. The same happens from Buckland to Berryman and then drummer Will Champion, allowing all band members to express themselves artistically. This process, however, is known to not always be linear, given how tracks like \"Magic\" and \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" started through the bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland respectively.", "* Jonny Buckland \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, piano, harmonica"]}, {"page": "Tufnell Park", "response": ["* Jonny Buckland, musician"]}, {"page": "Simon Pegg", "response": ["Pegg is close friends with Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin: Pegg appears as a violin-playing Elvis impersonator in Coldplay's 2010 single \"Christmas Lights\".
