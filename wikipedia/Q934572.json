The first of these was the keirin. This event involves between six and eight riders following a small motorbike (the Derny) around the 250m track for 5.5 laps, as the bike slowly builds up the speed. The bike pulls off with 2.5 laps to go and the riders race for the line. Hoy had previously competed at the keirin in various events but one of his first major successes was at the Manchester round of the World Cup Classics Series in 2007, shortly before the World Championships, where he also won, ahead of his teammate Ross Edgar.", "He made his return to racing in the UK at the Revolution\u00a022 event in Manchester in December. He received a standing ovation from the Manchester faithful at the start of the event when he was introduced to the crowd. At this event Hoy won both the Sprint and Keirin competitions, defeating likes of Jason Kenny, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar, Matthew Crampton and Teun Mulder along the way. Hoy competed in the World Cup Classics series' final event in Copenhagen, Denmark in February, helping his team to a gold medal in the team sprint event. However, he crashed out during the men's Keirin final and was forced to miss the final day of competition, including the men's sprint. Although at first, his injury seemed minor, he returned to Manchester where, following a scan, he was diagnosed with a serious de-gloving injury which finished his season and kept him off his bike for almost 3 months. He was unable to compete as planned at the Revolution 24 event in Manchester the following weekend, he did however make an appearance at the event. He had to pull out of the World Championships in Poland at the end of March, where he would have attempted to defend 2 World titles, because of the hip injury.", "* 2002 \u2013 15px 1\u00a0km time trial; 15px Team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Ross Edgar)", "* 2006 \u2013 15px Team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Ross Edgar); 15px 1\u00a0km time trial"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": [": Ross Edgar, Chris Hoy, Marco Librizzi & Craig Maclean, Team Sprint", "* Ross Edgar"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": [": Ross Edgar, Chris Hoy & Craig MacLean, Men's Team Sprint", ": Ross Edgar, Men's Sprint", ": Ross Edgar, Men's Keirin", "*Ross Edgar \u2013 Track Sprint Events"]}, {"page": "England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\"|Ross EdgarChris HoyCraig Maclean 44.309L  + 0.027"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics", "response": ["| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Ross Edgar Chris Hoy Craig MacLean ||  Theo Bos Teun Mulder Tim Veldt ||  Matthew Crampton Jason Queally Jamie Staff", "| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Chris Hoy  Jamie Staff  Matthew Crampton ||  Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9  Fran\u00e7ois Pervis  K\u00e9vin Sireau ||  Ross Edgar  Jason Kenny  Jason Queally ", "| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Chris Hoy  Craig MacLean  Ross Edgar ||  Robert F\u00f6rstemann  Matthias John  Michael Seidenbecher ||  Ryan Bayley  Shane Perkins  Scott Sunderland "]}, {"page": "2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["|Ross EdgarChris HoyCraig MacLean"]}, {"page": "2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's team sprint", "response": ["| || Ross EdgarChris HoyCraig MacLean || || 12.880 (1) || 13.451 (2) || ", "| || Ross EdgarChris HoyCraig MacLean || || 12.935 (2) || 13.303 (1) ||"]}, {"page": "2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["|Ross EdgarChris HoyJamie Staff||43.777"]}, {"page": "British National Circuit Race Championships", "response": ["| 1995 || Ross Edgar || Thomas White || Philip Law"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Ross Edgar"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2002 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Chris HoyCraig MacleanRoss Edgar "]}, {"page": "UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's team sprint", "response": ["|Chris Hoy Craig MacLeanRoss Edgar ", "|Chris Hoy Jamie Staff  Ross Edgar", "| Ross EdgarChris HoyJason Kenny"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics", "response": ["| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Ross Edgar Chris Hoy Craig Maclean ||  Theo Bos Teun Mulder Tim Veldt ||  Maximilian Levy Benjamin Wittmann Robert F\u00f6rstemann"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics", "response": ["| team\u00a0sprint ||  Ross EdgarJason KennyJamie Staff || \u0141ukasz KwiatkowskiKamil Kuczy\u0144skiMaciej Bielecki || Sebastian DoehrerRen\u00e9 EndersMathias Stumpf"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's keirin", "response": ["| Ross Edgar || ", "| Ross Edgar || ", "| Ross Edgar || "]}, {"page": "Jason Kenny", "response": ["Kenny made his debut in the world championships in 2008, finishing fifth overall in the sprint competition.

This saw members of the GB Team sprint squad, Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Ross Edgar, face off against members of the GB team pursuit squad, Ed Clancy, Geraint Thomas and Steven Burke. The race took place over three laps with a flying start, so very much was a mix between the sprint and endurance disciplines. Due to the three lap length of the race, the same as the Team Sprint event, it was expected by its nature to favour the sprint squad. However it was noted that the endurance squad regularly carry out similar short drills during training, so the playing field was quite level going into the event.
