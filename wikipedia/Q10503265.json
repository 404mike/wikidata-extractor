He started his senior career with Chesterfield Municipal before signing his first professional contract with Football League First Division side Oldham Athletic in August 1920. He made nine league appearances in his first season with the club and scored one goal, against Derby County. A change in manager for the 1921\u201322 season meant Braidwood found it difficult to break into the first-team, and he played only once in the campaign.\nIn the summer of 1922 Braidwood was signed on a free transfer by his former Oldham teammate David Wilson, who had since become player-manager of Football League Third Division North outfit Nelson. He was inserted straight into the team for the first league match of the season, a 2\u20136 defeat away at Bradford Park Avenue. Braidwood scored six goals in 38 games as Nelson won the division in 1923, and achieved promotion to the Football League Second Division. He scored against Fulham in the 1\u20131 draw at Seedhill on 22 December 1923, and played in Nelson's 1\u20130 win against Manchester United on 8 March 1924. Braidwood continued to play for Nelson until March 1926 when he signed for Rochdale, where he scored one goal in 87 league matches before moving into non-League football with Great Harwood and New Mills in 1930.\nBraidwood's cousin, James Pearson, also played professional football for Nelson.", "link_mentions": {}}}
