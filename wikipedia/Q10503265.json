He started his senior career with Chesterfield Municipal before signing his first professional contract with Football League First Division side Oldham Athletic in August 1920. He made nine league appearances in his first season with the club and scored one goal, against Derby County. A change in manager for the 1921\u201322 season meant Braidwood found it difficult to break into the first-team, and he played only once in the campaign.\nIn the summer of 1922 Braidwood was signed on a free transfer by his former Oldham teammate David Wilson, who had since become player-manager of Football League Third Division North outfit Nelson. He was inserted straight into the team for the first league match of the season, a 2\u20136 defeat away at Bradford Park Avenue. Braidwood scored six goals in 38 games as Nelson won the division in 1923, and achieved promotion to the Football League Second Division. He scored against Fulham in the 1\u20131 draw at Seedhill on 22 December 1923, and played in Nelson's 1\u20130 win against Manchester United on 8 March 1924. Braidwood continued to play for Nelson until March 1926 when he signed for Rochdale, where he scored one goal in 87 league matches before moving into non-League football with Great Harwood and New Mills in 1930.\nBraidwood's cousin, James Pearson, also played professional football for Nelson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1922\u201323 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Nelson entered the FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round, in which they defeated Rochdale. However, they were knocked out by Stalybridge Celtic in the next round. A total of 19 players were used by Nelson in their 40 first-team matches, only six of whom had played for the club in the previous season. Bob Hutchinson and Ernie Braidwood, both new signings, played every league and cup match. With 23 goals in 36 appearances, Joe Eddleston was the team's top goalscorer for the second season in succession. The highest attendance of the season at the club's Seedhill stadium was 12,000 on two occasions, the first of these the win over Chesterfield on 10 March 1923.", "There were a number of first-team personnel changes from the previous campaign, with only six first-team players staying at the club. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top scorer in 1921\u201322 with 16 league goals, remained along with Clement Rigg, Sid Hoad and Bob Lilley. Scottish defenders John Steel and James Price also continued to play for Nelson. Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews, who joined Bury,Dykes, p. 17 and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan, who retired from professional football. Goalkeepers Harry Heyes and Robert Bruce both moved on in the close season, so Stockport County custodian Joseph Birds was signed as a replacement in June 1922.Dykes, p. 20 In an attempt to improve the attacking prowess at the club, Wilson signed experienced inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme on a free transfer from Darlington in May 1922,Dykes, p. 73 and Scottish forward Mike McCulloch arrived from Heart of Midlothian for a transfer fee of \u00a3150.Dykes, p. 51 Wilson also added to the defensive ranks with the signings of his former Oldham Athletic team-mate Ernie Braidwood, and of Jimmy Broadhead on a free transfer from Scunthorpe & Lindsey United.Dykes, p. 22", "| Ernie Braidwood", "October began with a 1\u20133 defeat away at Ashington, although new signing Arthur Wolstenholme scored his first goal of the campaign, and Nelson's first ever league goal against the Northumberland club. A 2\u20130 win in the return match with goals from Eddleston and McCulloch took Nelson to the top of the league for the first time in the season the following week, overtaking Wigan Borough at the summit. The month ended with a pair of wins over Tranmere Rovers; the first a 2\u20130 win on 21 October, and the second a 1\u20130 success a week later thanks to John Black's first goal in a Nelson jersey. The team failed to score for only the second time in the season in the 0\u20131 away defeat to Barrow on 4 November. Despite conceding at Seedhill for the first time in the campaign, Nelson atoned for the loss seven days later with a 2\u20131 victory as a result of strikes from Eddleston and Wolstenholme. Nelson did not play another league match for two weeks, when they faced Rochdale at home. A first Nelson goal for defender Ernie Braidwood could not prevent the side succumbing to a 1\u20132 reverse, not helped by first-team regulars Wilson and Wolstenholme missing the match due to injury, forcing inexperienced inside-right William Bennett to make his league debut.Dykes, p. 19", "David Wilson used a total of 19 players during the 1922\u201323 season and there were nine different goalscorers.

He did not make the team as regularly in a higher league, and was often second choice left-half behind new signing Leigh Collins. Broadhead found his first-team opportunities highly limited during the 1924\u201325 season. On 21 April 1925, he played his first match in almost a year when he was selected for the 2\u20131 home win over Southport.Dykes, p. 78 He played in the first six games of the following campaign, but was then replaced by Ernie Braidwood and later by Ambrose Harris.

He went on to play the following ten matches, before his place in the team was taken by Ernie Braidwood. Harris returned to the side on 27 February 1926, for the 4\u20130 win at home against Durham City.

Centre forward Joe Eddleston scored 26 goals in 43 games to become the team's top goalscorer for the fourth consecutive season. Two Nelson records were set during the campaign, although one was later broken; the seven-goal winning margin against Crewe Alexandra was never bettered in Football League matches, while the attendance of 13,500 for the visit of Darlington in April 1925 was the largest ever seen at Seedhill at that time.", "A week later Eddleston took his tally of goals to eight, scoring twice as Nelson overcame Walsall 2\u20131 at Seedhill. He scored again in the next match as the team gained their first point of the season away from home, drawing 1\u20131 at Wigan Borough, who had been Nelson's first ever opponents in the Football League over three years previously. Half-back Ernie Braidwood scored his first goal of the campaign in the 2\u20131 win against Halifax Town.

November began badly for Nelson as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season, a 0\u20135 loss away at New Brighton. Allan Mathieson and Joe Wilcox scored two goals each as New Brighton won the first ever competitive meeting between the two sides. Nelson moved up to sixth place in the league following the next match, a 1\u20130 win at home to Grimsby Town.

In the first home match of the new year, on 17 January 1925, Nelson atoned for their defeat to Accrington Stanley earlier in the season with a 4\u20131 win thanks to two goals from Eddleston, one from Chadwick, and a first goal in almost three months for Cameron. Clem Rigg scored two penalties the following week as the side beat Barrow to move above Bradford Park Avenue into fifth position in the Third Division North. On 7 February Nelson won their third consecutive home fixture, beating Tranmere Rovers by four goals to one. Left-half Herbert Butterworth made his senior debut for the club against Tranmere, despite signing from Wolverhampton Wanderers almost two years previously,Dykes (2009), p. 25 while Chadwick scored twice in one game for the first time. A trip to Walsall seven days later brought a first away victory of 1925 for the team as goals from Chadwick and Hoad gave Nelson a 2\u20131 win, which elevated them to third place in the league. A narrow win against Wigan Borough at Seedhill on 21 February lifted Nelson further up the table into second position, behind only Darlington.
