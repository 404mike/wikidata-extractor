In the press before the game there was speculation that Hanley would actually play Phil Clarke at five-eighth and himself at lock, though most were questioning why the man who sparked the Lions in the second test, former captain Garry Schofield, wasn't in the starting side (it was rumoured that personal differences between Leeds teammates Hanley and Schofield dating back to Schofield retaining the Lions captaincy over Hanley for the 1992 World Cup Final is what kept Schofield not only out of the first test team, but on the Lions bench for the final two games). The Lions changes for the decider were: Graham Steadman was dropped and Gary Connolly moved from the centres to his preferred fullback with Paul Newlove moving from the bench to replace Connolly in the centres. Shaun Edwards returned from suspension to captain the side, demoting Bobby Goulding to the bench. Phil Clarke did play 5/8 with Darryl Powell moved to the bench, Chris Joynt from the front row to lock and prop Barrie McDermott into the run on side while pacey St. Helens back rower Sonny Nickle came into the team on the bench replacing Mick Cassidy. Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton made just one change to the side that had comprehensively won the second test with David Fairleigh coming onto the bench for his second test to replace 20 test veteran Paul Sironen. Fairleigh had originally been chosen over Sironen for the second test but had fallen ill on the day of the game which saw the giant Balmain forward brought back into the side.", "|IC ||17|| Sonny Nickle"]}, {"page": "1997 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["|Sonny Nickle"]}, {"page": "1998 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["|Sonny Nickle"]}, {"page": "1996 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["*CCR4: Jeremy Donougher, Sonny Nickle, Davide Longo, Gary Christie, Paul Cook, Karl Fairbank, Carlos Hassan, Paul Loughlin and Paul Medley all scored their 1st tries for the Bulls."]}, {"page": "Paul Newlove", "response": ["St. Helens on 29 November 1995 paid Bradford Northern \u00a3250,000 cash (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately \u00a3464,900 in 2013), and also sent Sonny Nickle, Bernard Dwyer and Paul Loughlin to Bradford Northern.
