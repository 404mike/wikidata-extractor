Crane's first husband was in the Rhodesian Army, fighting in the Bush War, when he was killed at the age of 25. Crane then had a child and was pregnant with the couple's second, and turned to a life of crime after his death. Her activities included smuggling diamonds and emeralds, making blackmarket currency deals, owning a striptease joint, and selling hard-core pornography. In her biography, which appeared after her unexplained death, she describes how she would tuck emeralds into her beehive hairdo or pack them into her son's nappies for smuggling. Crane invested her profits in legitimate businesses such as the Copa Cobana restaurant, one of Rhodesia's most popular and fashionable meeting places. In later life, she was a commodity broker."]}, {"page": "Abbotsford, Johannesburg", "response": ["In the early 2000s prominent public figures Hazel Crane and Brett Kebble were murdered in the suburb.IOL 13 November 2003 :Kebble and Hazel Crane murdered in same area "]}, {"page": "Category talk:Murder victims", "response": ["* socialites: Bessie Darling, Murder of Wendy Albano, Hazel Crane, Gale Benson, Society Murders, Murder of Martine Vik Magnussen, Doris Angleton, Barbara Daly Baekeland, Minna Craucher, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Kathleen Peterson"]}, {"page": "List of South African women writers", "response": ["* Hazel Crane (1951\u20132003), memoirist"]}, {"page": "List of Zimbabwean women writers", "response": ["* Hazel Crane (1951\u20132003), memoirist"]}, {"page": "List of unsolved murders (21st century)", "response": ["*South African memoirist and socialite Hazel Crane (52), a close friend of Winnie Mandela, was shot and killed on 10 November 2003, in her car while traveling to Johannesburg, where she was expected to testify in the trial of an Israeli man accused of killing her husband.
