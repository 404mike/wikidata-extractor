The collection was largely made up of specimens collected around the world by other collectors and is now at the New York Botanical Garden, having been purchased after his death. These collectors included Richard Spruce and also Alfred Russel Wallace, who became Mitten's son-in-law in 1866.\nHe had four daughters: Annie, the eldest, was the only one to marry;  \nanother, Flora, provided assistance in compiling notes for William Edward Nicholson to write a  sketch with bibliography  on her father.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Russel Wallace", "response": ["After a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L.

In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876.

The discovery of similar odd plants in the mid-20th century by Dr. Noriwo Takaki (1915\u20132006) in Japan sparked more interest.  The many unusual features of these plants led to the establishment in 1958 of the species Takakia lepidozioides, in a new genus Takakia, named to honor the man who rediscovered it and recognized its unique characteristics.  The species originally described by Mitten was subsequently recognized by Grolle as belonging to this new genus, and accordingly renamed Takakia ceratophylla."]}, {"page": "James Motley", "response": ["After the family hit substantial financial problems, he went out to Labuan in 1849 to pioneer coal mining and other enterprises for the Eastern Archipelago Company.

Inspired by the quality and quantity of Kew's herbarium, library, and gardens, the couple set about organizing an institution of comparable stature for New York.  A Club meeting was held in October, 1888; rich and prominent citizens were recruited as incorporators; and the Botanical Garden was established by act of the state legislature in 1891.   Elizabeth was a prime mover in the efforts to raise funds for the organization in the 1890s. Nathaniel became the first Director-in-Chief of the Botanical Garden in 1896; Elizabeth joined him in a volunteer capacity.  It was largely through her interest that the collection of liverworts and mosses of William Mitten was acquired for the NYBG in 1906.
