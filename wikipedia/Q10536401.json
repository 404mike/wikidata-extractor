The team continued their campaign of friendly fixtures into 1890, with varying degrees of success, whilst competing in the FA Cup for the first time. With the club hoping to be accepted into the newly formed Midland Counties League for the following season the committee made a number of additions to the squad in March, signing Billy Bairstow from local side Sheffield Club but more significantly signing a trio of players from nearby Rotherham Swifts. Rab Howell, Arthur Watson and Michael Whitham would all become stalwarts of the team in the coming seasons, with both Howell and Whitham subsequently going on to represent England. They represented United's first reported entry into the transfer market, arriving for a combined fee of \u00a3200, and signalled a new era of full professionalism for the club."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["|William Calder"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["United continued to add to the squad, signing keeper Will Lilley from Staveley, before registering a string of victories until the end of the year, culminating in a 6\u20130 win over Stockton at the end of December.  The league then took a winter break of almost three months, not resuming until almost the end of March.  The club continued to strengthen their attacking options by recruiting three additional forwards from Scotland; Sandy Wallace, John Scott and resigning former player James Duncan.  William Calder and Harry Munro were both allowed to join Gainsborough Trinity, before United resumed their league campaign with a 4\u20133 loss away at Newcastle West End who were struggling at the bottom of the table.  This signalled a down\u2013turn in form and inconsistent results until the end of the season meant that United lost touch with the top of the table and eventually finished third."]}]}}
