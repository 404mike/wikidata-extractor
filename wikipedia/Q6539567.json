He made his debut as a substitute in the 66th minute of a 1\u20130 victory over Hayes & Yeading United on 8 August 2009, which was followed by his first start in a 1\u20130 defeat to Salisbury City on 11 August due to Liam Dolman not being fit. He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury he was able to play in the next match, a 2\u20130 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was taking time to gel, saying \"We've all played at a high standard, individually and collectively we are good, but there's something missing. I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes.\" His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot against Kettering Town in a 2\u20130 away victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said \"It was a good finish by Duane, he does it in training quite often\". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5\u20131 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle. He did not miss any further playing time as he featured in the following match, a 1\u20131 draw with Rushden & Diamonds on 5 April 2010. He finished 2009\u201310 with 49 appearances and 1 goal for Kidderminster."]}, {"page": "AFC Rushden & Diamonds", "response": ["|align=center|Liam Dolman", "|align=center|Liam Dolman"]}, {"page": "Dolman (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Liam Dolman (born 1987), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 24 || RB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Liam Dolman"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 19 || RB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Liam Dolman"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 24 || CB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Liam Dolman"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 19 || RB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Liam Dolman"]}]}}
