He started his career in the youth system at Norwich City, even though his signature was sought by many London clubs. He scored Norwich's first goal in the 2-1 FA Youth Cup victory over the previous season's champions Aston Villa in December 2002. He accompanied the first team during the 2003 pre-season tour to the Netherlands and prior to the signing of Marc Edworthy, was acting as second choice right back behind Keith Briggs. In January 2004, it was announced that he would not be offered a new professional deal by the Canaries after 8 years at the club.  In September 2004, he signed for Barnet, making his debut in a 3\u20131 win over Stevenage Borough in the Football League Trophy. Barnet won the Conference title in his first season with the club, gaining promotion to Football League Two. In May 2005, he signed a new one-year contract with the club after making nineteen appearances in the previous campaign, scoring once in the 7\u20131 rout against Farnborough Town. He failed to secure a regular starting place for the club in the Football League and Barnet announced in May 2006 that he would not be retained."]}]}}
