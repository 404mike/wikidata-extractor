It was here that he met his wife, Susan Martin, an undergraduate who was president of the Anglican Society.\nHe was appointed Rector of St Cuthbert's, Hawick in 1955 and he and Susan were married in the summer of 1956.  After 5 years, Crosfield was asked to be Chaplain of Gordonstoun School and his appointment coincided with the arrival at the school of the young Prince Charles, whom he later prepared for confirmation.\nIn 1968, he was appointed Vice-Provost and Canon Residentiary at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, but, following Patrick Rodger's departure to be Bishop of Manchester, he became its Provost in 1970, a post he was to hold until retirement 20 years later. During his time at the cathedral, he founded St. Mary's Music School, which had grown out of the St. Mary's Cathedral Choir School. The Music School opened its doors in 1972, with Yehudi Menuhin as its patron.\nIn the 1980s, horrified by the effects of unemployment on young people, Crosfield set up the St. Mary's Cathedral Workshop, which has looked after the fabric of the Victorian Cathedral whilst training apprentice stonemasons and reviving the skills and trades associated with old buildings that were in danger of disappearing.\nMoving to Penicuik, near Edinburgh, in retirement, he continued his work as a priest as part of the Ministry Team of St. James the Less Episcopal Church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Episcopal)", "response": ["* 1970\u20131990 Philip Crosfield"]}, {"page": "George Philip Chorley Crosfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Crosfield"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Philip Crosfield, 88, Anglican priest."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2013", "response": ["*Philip Crosfield, 88, Scottish Anglican priest.Obituary: The Rev Canon Philip Crosfield, OBE, soldier and priest, news.scotsman.com, 27 March 2013"]}, {"page": "George Crosfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Crosfield"]}, {"page": "Crosfield", "response": ["*Philip Crosfield (1924\u20132013), British Anglican priest"]}, {"page": "Phillip Crosfield", "response": ["#redirect Philip Crosfield "]}]}}
