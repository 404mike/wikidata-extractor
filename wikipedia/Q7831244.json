The first single for Silvertone, \"Elephant Stone\", made little impact, and in early 1989 the band's performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences.Robb, p. 195 \"Made of Stone\" received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ Richard Skinner on his late night Radio One show, but peaked at number ninety on the UK Singles Chart. The Stone Roses was released in April  / May 1989, initially to mostly positive reviews, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 32 in mid-May, the highest position it would reach that year.Robb, p. 207 This was followed with the single \"She Bangs the Drums\", which gave them a top forty UK hit, and a number one on the UK Independent Chart, and by that point they were receiving much greater press attention and were selling out shows across the country.Robb, p. 218Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980\u20131989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 218 The band gained widespread notoriety when, one minute into a live 1989 TV performance on the BBC's The Late Show, the power failed, prompting Ian Brown to repeatedly squeal \"Amateurs!\" at Tracey MacLeod. Later in 1989 the band released a double A-side single, \"Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For\", which reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in November.Roberts, David, ed. (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums (19th ed.). HiT Entertainment. p. 534. . Originally intended as a B-side, \"Fools Gold\" quickly became the Roses' most famous song and a performance of it on Top of the Pops cemented their national fame.

Whilst sitting there, Gauthier tweeted the actions of the food critics to his followers and criticised them on several points such as their loudness, a copy of The Independent sitting facing out in an open bag by MacLeod's feet and that Norman didn't know what aioli was.

He said that \"Titanic is a total waste of life and only worth visiting if you're the sort of saddo who thinks it's essential for your credibility to be seen in the latest MPW restaurant\".  Another reviewer for The Independent, Tracey MacLeod, described the interior as an \"Art-Deco approximation of Hades\".  She ordered the clam chowder but thought it was thin and the potato tasted re-heated. She also thought that the sticky toffee pudding was \"neither sticky enough nor toffeeish enough\", but the bread and butter pudding was better. Richard Wallace ate at Titanic in March 1999 and reviewed it for The Daily Mirror. He described the service as \"first class\" but that his fries were undercooked.

A ceiling clad with fabric that would feel at home on the seats of the Bakerloo line, carpeted corridors your gran would like, and a scattering of pot plants and nic-nacs lend a feel that's simultaneously homely and nothing at all like a home you could imagine. Grace Dent of the London Evening Standard described a \"glorious dining room that is part classic French brasserie, part industrial\u2014supporting pillars, a fireman's pole and low-hanging lights\u2014and part chintzy in-joke with pot plants, ornaments, thick hallway carpets and marble tables.\""]}, {"page": "Bread Street Kitchen", "response": ["Food critic Jay Rayner visited the restaurant for The Observer in October 2011. He described it as \"loud and brash\", but enjoyed several dishes such as a sea bass with aubergine pur\u00e9e, and a veal chop which he thought could have been improved by resting it longer. But he thought that the tamarind chicken wings were overpriced and of poor quality, the burger on the menu was \"overminced to a paste, destroying both flavour and texture\". He felt that the restaurant might improve with time. Tracey MacLeod said that \"nearly everything\u00a0... was good\" in her review in The Independent. She liked the burger and suggested that that mutton pie was going to become the restaurant's signature dish. She found that her waitress wasn't as familiar with the menu as she would have liked, and that the service was very slow."]}]}}
