The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper Neil McCorkell who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. Neville Rogers and Johnny Arnold played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and Gerry Hill both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder Jim Bailey, who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. Playfair considered \"the steady and loyal George Heath\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, Victor Ransom, Lofty Herman and the injury-plagued Charles Knott. Other players included Gilbert Dawson, Thomas Dean, Arthur Holt, Alan Shirreff and future stalwart Leo Harrison.Playfair, pp. 110\u2013111."]}, {"page": "Dean (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Dean (1920\u20132004), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "World record progression 4 \u00d7 200 metres freestyle relay", "response": ["|Thomas Dean, James Guy, Matthew Richards, Duncan Scott"]}, {"page": "Thomas Dean (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Dean was a cricketer.", "*Thomas Dean (mechanic) from Dean Rocks", "*Thomas Dean (computer scientist), professor at Brown University and researcher at Google", "*Thomas Dean (swimmer) (born 2000), British swimmer", "*Thomas Deane (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Thomas Dean, cricketer, was born in Gosport"]}, {"page": "Dean, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Dean"]}, {"page": "List of Eastern Province representative cricketers", "response": ["* Thomas Dean, 1956/57"]}]}}
