Subsequently, the Doctor invites Rose to be his travelling companion, taking her to the end of the world and tampering her mobile so she can remain in contact with her mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), and boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) while time-travelling in \"The End of the World\". In their travels through time and space, Rose learns the importance of not tampering with history, when in \"Father's Day\", she attempts to save the life of her father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall), who had died when she was a baby. Throughout their journeys, she and the Doctor are haunted by two mysterious recurring words: \"Bad Wolf\". Rose, the Doctor, and new companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) come to understand the meaning of this phrase in \"Bad Wolf\", when they encounter an unstoppable army of Daleks on the space station Satellite 5, which first appeared in \"The Long Game\".

Returning, she uses her power over the infinity of time and space to spread the words \"Bad Wolf\" over its entirety, then saving the universe from the Dalek invasion. Rose resurrects Jack, who died from Dalek fire, and destroys the Dalek fleet before the Doctor drains the energy out of her to save her life from its harmful effects.

She is later attacked by shop window dummies but is saved when Rose and the Doctor destroy the alien consciousness able to control plastic. When Rose returns to London, twelve months have passed; in the intervening year Jackie had organised a missing person campaign to search for her daughter and accused Rose's boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) of murder.
