Inverness also knocked other SPL teams out of cup competitions, including Motherwell and Hearts. Over the first ten years of their existence the club had been responsible for a total of 12 'shocks' and as a result had gained themselves a reputation as being \"giant killers\".

Having led 1\u20130 for the majority of the game thanks to a Graham Bayne goal, Steven Pressley equalised before Kenny Miller netted the winner in stoppage time.

This, unlike many rivalries, is generally friendly as both sets of fans live and work together given their close geographic locations.  Due to the geographical proximity of the clubs and despite the rivalry, Inverness CT have signed many former Ross County players over the years, including Barry Wilson, Stuart Golabek, Roy McBain, Graham Bayne, Richard Hastings, Steven Hislop, John Rankin, Andrew Barrowman, Lionel Djebi-Zadi and Don Cowie. Many former Inverness CT players have also \"crossed the bridge\" in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser,  Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years.

Previous manager Aidy Boothroyd left the club by \"mutual consent\" in November 2008 and was replaced by former Reading and Chelsea academy boss Brendan Rodgers. New arrivals Jack Cork, Don Cowie and Mike Williamson contributed to Watford's improved form between February and May 2009, lifting Watford away from the relegation zone in the closing weeks of the season. The club's financial problems had been well documented and several changes to the playing staff were anticipated over the summer. In addition to anticipated player sales, another person linked with a move away from Vicarage Road was manager Rodgers, who had been linked with a move to former club Reading. He was not happy with the suggestion that he was in talks with Reading and suggested that his integrity was being questioned. When he subsequently joined Reading in June, Watford received an initial \u00a3500,000 in compensation.

This was followed by a headed equaliser from Doncaster's James Hayter ten minutes later. In the second half, Doncaster striker Dean Shiels had a shot which his manager felt had crossed the line. However, the referee deemed that it had not, and the match finished as a draw. Watford were defeated 2\u20130 at Sheffield United in their next league fixture, with Jamie Ward and Ched Evans scoring for the opposition. The result caused Watford to slip into the relegation places for the only time of the season. Mackay expressed disappointment at his side for the goals they had conceded, and revealed that club was considering a transfer offer for Smith.", "Don Cowie made his debut for Scotland during the October international break.
