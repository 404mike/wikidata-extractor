Cornell University Press, 1990), Robert V Bruce writes: \"Whatever the effect of the tour (if it ever came off), one  effect of the circular was to lodge David [Charles] Bell, [Alexander's uncle] in the Dublin House of Correction a year later\". David Charles Bell (1817-1902), taught English Literature and Elocution at Dublin University, and apparently did spend some time in prison in Dublin as a result of his own nationalist commitments. According to Bruce, in 1865 he wrote to Alexander's father, his brother Melville Bell, from the prison: \"still... looking forward to the proud watchwords--Ireland! Independence!\"  But we are informed from the source cited (Bell, p. 271), which includes letters Bell wrote to Luby from America, that the tour of the United States did go ahead in October 1864, and that the lecturer was David Bell (no relation) formerly of Ballybay."]}]}}
