Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Carol Ann Duffy, who was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "October 17", "response": ["*1921 \u2013 George Mackay Brown, Scottish author, poet, and playwright (d. 1996)"]}, {"page": "Orkney", "response": ["The best known literary figures from modern Orkney are the poet Edwin Muir, the poet and novelist George Mackay Brown, and the novelist Eric Linklater.Drever, David \"Orkney Literature\" in Omand (2003) p. 257."]}, {"page": "Shetland", "response": ["There is one monthly magazine in production: Shetland.\"Home\", Millgaet Media, Retrieved 17 March 2011 The quarterly The New Shetlander, founded in 1947, is said to be Scotland's longest-running literary magazine.\"The New Shetlander\", Voluntary Action Shetland, Retrieved 8 December 2013 For much of the later 20th century, it was the major vehicle for the work of local writers \u2014 and of others, including early work by George Mackay Brown.\"Life and Work: Part 3\", , George Mackay Brown website, Retrieved 8 December 2013"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*George Mackay Brown (1921\u20131996), Scottish poet, author and dramatist"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|George Mackay Brown || Beside the Ocean of Time || John Murray"]}, {"page": "Dietrich Bonhoeffer", "response": ["** George Mackay Brown, Magnus (Hogarth Press, 1973) A novel in which the imprisoned 10th century Orcadian saint Magnus Erlendsson is transformed into Bonhoeffer."]}, {"page": "Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney", "response": ["Saint Magnus is the subject of the novel Magnus by Orcadian author George Mackay Brown, which was published in 1973, St Magnus, Earl of Orkney by John Mooney, and \"Saint Magnus, the Last Viking\" a novel for young adults by Susan Peek, published in 2016.

According to friends, their marriage was happy and peaceful, as they complemented each other well, and MacLean \"mellowed\" with age and family life. He had never been a member of the Communist Party, and the Soviet occupation of Poland after the war caused MacLean to become disillusioned with the Soviet Union and Stalinism. He retained his socialist world-view and strong belief in social justice. During this period, he frequently reviewed poetry and continued to make friends in literary circles, including the younger poets Iain Crichton Smith and George Mackay Brown.
