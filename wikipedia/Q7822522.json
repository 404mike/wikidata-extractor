Although Hancock's decision to cease working with James, when it became known in early 1960,John Fisher Tony Hancock: The Definitive Biography, London: Harper Collins, 2008, p. 289 disappointed many at the time, his last BBC series in 1961 contains some of his best-remembered work (including \"The Blood Donor\" and \"The Radio Ham\"). After breaking with his scriptwriters Ray Galton and Alan Simpson later that year, his career declined.", "Sidney James featured in both the radio and TV versions, while the radio version also included regulars Bill Kerr, Kenneth Williams and, successively, Moira Lister, Andr\u00e9e Melly and Hattie Jacques. The series rejected the variety format then dominant in British radio comedy and instead used a form drawn more from everyday life: the situation comedy, with the humour coming from the characters and the circumstances in which they find themselves. Owing to a contractual wrangle with producer Jack Hylton, Hancock had an ITV series, The Tony Hancock Show, during this period, which ran in 1956-57.", "Hancock starred in the film The Rebel (1961), in which he plays the role of an office worker-turned-artist who finds himself successful after a move to Paris, but only as the result of mistaken identity. Although a success in Britain, the film was not well received in the United States: owing to the existence of a contemporary television series of the same name, the film had to be retitled, and the new title, Call Me Genius, inflamed American critics. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times thought Hancock \"even less comical\" than Norman Wisdom.Bosley Crowther \"Screen: A British Comic:Tony Hancock Stars in 'Call Me Genius'\", New York Times, 17 October 1961.", "Hancock continued to make regular appearances on British television until 1967, including a 50 minute show for BBC2 from the Royal Festival Hall, which was poorly-received. By then his alcoholism was seriously affecting his performances. Two unsuccessful variety series for ABC Television, The Blackpool Show (1966) and Hancock's (1967) were his last work for British television. He tried a role in a Disney film - The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin - but was sacked after reportedly having trouble with the mock-Shakespearian dialogue. He collapsed with a liver attack on 1 January 1967 and was told he would die within three months if he continued drinking.Fisher, John Tony Hancock: The Definitive Biography (2008) p. 439  In December 1967, while recovering from a broken rib from a drunken fall, he became ill with pneumonia.Fisher, John Tony Hancock: The Definitive Biography (2008) p. 454 His final television appearances were in Australia under a contract to make a 13-part series for the Seven Network. However, after arriving in Australia in March 1968, only three programmes were completed and remained unaired for nearly four years. These shows are the only existing television footage of him in colour, as all his shows up to this point had been made for black-and-white television.", "Freddie Ross worked as his publicist from 1954 and became more involved in his life, eventually becoming his mistress. He divorced Cicely in 1965 and married Ross in December of that year.GRO Register of Marriages: DEC 1965 5D 1664 ST MARYLEBONE - Anthony J. Hancock = Freda (Freddie) Ross This second marriage was short-lived. During these years Hancock was also involved with Joan Le Mesurier (n\u00e9e Malin), the new wife of actor John Le Mesurier, Hancock's best friend and a regular supporting character-actor from his television series. Joan was later to describe the relationship in her book Lady Don't Fall Backwards,Lady Don't Fall Backwards by Joan Le Mesurier (ISIS, 1990, ) including the claim that her husband readily forgave the affair; he is quoted as saying that if it had been anyone else he would not have understood it, but with Tony Hancock it made sense. In July 1966 Freddie took an overdose but survived. Arriving in Blackpool to record an edition of his variety series, Hancock was met by pressmen asking about his wife's attempted suicide. The final dissolution of the marriage took place a few days before Hancock's own suicide.John Fisher, Tony Hancock : the Definitive Biography, London : HarperCollins, 2008, pp474-5", "In one of his suicide notes he wrote: \"Things just seemed to go too wrong too many times.\"John Fisher, Tony Hancock : the Definitive Biography, London : HarperCollins, 2008, p.469 His ashes were brought back to England by satirist Willie RushtonFisher, p.484 and were buried in St Dunstan's Church in Cranford, London.", "In a 2002 poll, BBC radio listeners voted Hancock their favourite British comedian. Commenting on this poll, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson observed that modern-day creations such as Alan Partridge and David Brent owed much of their success to mimicking dominant features of Tony Hancock's character. \"The thing they've all got in common is self-delusion,\" they remarked, in a statement issued by the BBC. \"They all think they're more intelligent than everyone else, more cultured, that people don't recognise their true greatness \u2013 self-delusion in every sense. And there's nothing people like better than failure.\" Mary Kalemkerian, Head of Programmes for BBC 7, commented: \"Classic comedians such as Tony Hancock and the Goons are obviously still firm favourites with BBC radio listeners. Age doesn't seem to matter \u2013 if it's funny, it's funny.\" Dan Peat of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society said of the poll: \"It's fantastic news. If he was alive, he would have taken it one of two ways. He would probably have made some kind of dry crack, but in truth he would have been chuffed.\"", "Playwright Roy Smiles' play about Tony Hancock: The Lad Himself, was staged at the Edinburgh Festival in 2013 with Mark Brailsford as Tony Hancock.
