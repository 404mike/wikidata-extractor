In her exploration of the subject, she also included studies on \"vaginal imagery,\" \"video pornography,\" and \"visibility and the female body.\" In her book, she discusses the history of the female nude and how to decide where to draw the line between pornography and art. She also talks about how traditionally, the female nude \"signifies the containment and disciplining of unruly female matter (and sexuality),\" and also, how in a Kantian fashion, women's bodies represent a challenge of converting a troublesome nature into \"pure art.\" Nead also discusses how feminist artists have resisted these traditions in various different ways. She further explores the use of women's bodies in art in her book about Chila Burman's work, Chila Kumari Burman: Beyond Two Cultures (1995)."]}, {"page": "Pointon (surname)", "response": ["*Marcia Pointon, British art historian"]}]}}
