Having made an indifferent start to the 2019\u201320 League Two season, Colchester entered the play-offs for the first time with a 3\u20131 win at Leyton Orient on Boxing day. The team reached the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup, eliminating both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur on penalties after holding both Premier League teams to 0\u20130 draws. In the quarter-finals they were beaten 3\u20130 by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The season ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the table was decided on points per game with Colchester in the play-offs in sixth-place. However the club announced that 16 players would be released at their end of their contracts, with chairman Robbie Cowling admitting that he \"would have been determined to re-sign\" Brandon Comley, Ryan Jackson, Frank Nouble and Luke Prosser in normal circumstances. Colchester lost out to Exeter City after extra-time in the play-off semi-finals and McGreal was subsequently dismissed by the club on 14 July 2020 as Cowling felt that \"significant changes are required that will be best served with a new head coach\".

After half an hour of his debut, playing at right-back five days later at home to Reading, Jenkinson dislocated a shoulder in a collision with teammate Michael Morrison and was expected to be \"out long-term\". He made his return to the first team when he started the FA Cup tie against Huddersfield Town on 27 January 2018, and earned a league start two weeks later, replacing the injured Jonathan Grounds.

He continued in the struggling side for the next six matchesall defeatsuntil a knee injury forced him out. He was restored to the starting eleven in early April for the visit to league leaders Brighton & Hove Albion, but the Birmingham Mail correspondent thought his forward-thinking nature made his selection too risky while the team remained in relegation danger. He finished the season with ten appearances as the team secured their Championship survival on the last day of the season. Keita was a second-half substitute in the opening match of the 2017\u201318 season, but picked up a groin injury that kept him out for a few weeks.

Redknapp said afterwards that he couldn't claim to have enjoyed the match, that \"it was almost the same team which struggled to stay up last season and that is a big worry\", and if the club failed to sign some quality players it would be \"another tough season\". Wearing a mask to protect his broken nose and damaged cheekbone, Morrison started the televised visit to Burton Albion and Shotton, whose wife had recently given birth, was left out entirely. Donaldson's cross was knocked down by Jutkiewicz for Maghoma to tap in against his former club, but after the break, Birmingham conceded two well-worked goals to lose to Burton for the third time in three attempts. Redknapp was vitriolic afterwards, accusing the players of having \"ruined Zola last year\", of failing to \"win any battles\", criticising \"four or five of them\" for disappearing, and stating that what he needs \"is to change a lot of them because that's not good enough.\" Before the next fixture, three loanees arrived from Premier League clubs: inexperienced full-back Cohen Bramall and England international defender Carl Jenkinson, both from Arsenal, and Southampton striker Sam Gallagher.

For the fourth-round tie, both Birmingham and their hosts, Premier League club Huddersfield Town, made seven changes, Cotterill also switching to three at the back with Cohen Bramall and Carl Jenkinson, recently returned to fitness, at wing-back. The match ended 1\u20131 after Lukas Jutkiewicz took advantage of a defensive mistake to equalise. He also had a header disallowed for what was reported as a \"dubious\" offside decision, and Huddersfield's Joe Lolley should have won the match in stoppage time.", "In the first round of the EFL Cup, Birmingham were drawn at home to Crawley Town of League Two. They had little difficulty beating a Crawley side with nine changes from their preceding league match: Che Adams scored his first senior hat-trick, and goals from David Davis and Robert Tesche gave Birmingham a 5\u20131 win. In the second round, at home to Premier League club AFC Bournemouth, Birmingham lined up in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation and gave a debut to loanee Cohen Bramall at left wing-back and a first start to Isaac Vassell. They had the better of the first half, and took the lead after 11 minutes when Jonathan Grounds headed a corner down to the unmarked Maikel Kieftenbeld who tapped in. After Vassell beat defenders for pace, turned the goalkeeper and rolled the ball towards goal, Tyrone Mings was able to get back to clear. Vassell was replaced through injury at half-time, Bournemouth equalised a minute later, the momentum switched, and a defensive lapse allowed Mark Pugh to score the winner after 68 minutes.", "| 21 August 2017 || Cohen Bramall || Arsenal || End of season", "!scope=row|Cohen Bramall *"]}]}}
