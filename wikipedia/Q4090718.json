After serving in the army during the First World War he undertook various jobs, including a brief appointment as an officer in the Armenian army, and wrote journalism and books on a range of topics. He served two terms as a Labour Member of Parliament between 1929 and 1947.\nBaldwin never achieved ministerial office in Britain. His last post was as Governor of the Leeward Islands, from 1948 to 1950.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oliver Baldwin", "response": ["#REDIRECTOliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["***Oliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, MP for Dudley 1929\u20131931, Paisley 1945\u20131947 (Labour).
