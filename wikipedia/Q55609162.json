Howard was elected captain at Christmas 1702 and again met with John Bowen, at the port of Mayotta. Together, the two attacked the East Indiaman Pembroke in March 1703, off Johanna Island in the Comoros Islands. Howard left Bowen for a period of time while Bowen's ship Speedy Return was being careened. Briefly putting in to Madagascar, Howard's men visited with Aert Van Tuyl (\"Ort Van Tyle\"), an ex-pirate who owned an inland plantation. When they heard that Van Tuyl had earlier attacked some fellow pirates (possibly Thomas Mostyn), they fought with Van Tuyl and his native allies. Howard's men escaped but were forced to leave David Williams and Tom Collins behind, whom Van Tuyl kept as slaves until their escape some months later. Howard and Bowen cooperated again in August 1703 where they attacked and took two Indian ships, with a combined value of \u00a370,000. The two crews were merged aboard the larger of the Indian ships \u2013 a 56-gun ship renamed the Defiant \u2013 with Bowen in command. Returning to Rajapura, the crew divided the takings."]}, {"page": "Van Tuyl", "response": ["In 1695, brothers Otto and Aert van Tuyl, ship carpenters by trade, landed berths aboard John Hoar's pirate ship John and Rebecca, bound from New York City to the Indian Ocean: Otto as the ship's doctor and Aert the ship's carpenter (for more information about this trip, see Abraham Samuel). After taking one major prize ship, they sailed to St. Maries Island off northeast Madagascar to refit and to sell their stolen goods. Shortly after their arrival in 1697 the local natives revolted, killing a number of resident pirates. Otto and Aert survived, apparently by allying themselves with a rival native faction on the mainland of Madagascar. The following year captains William Kidd and Robert Culliford arrived at St. Maries. Otto and a number of Kidd's men joined Culliford for what turned out to be a brutal but lucrative cruise to the Malabar Coast of India.\u201cCopy of ye Examination of Otto Van Toyle one of Hoar\u2019s men\u2026\u201d in 1699 Colonial correspondence, Public Records Office, Kew, Richmond, Surrey.

Charles Johnson,\u201d Manuel Schonhorn Ed., U. of South Carolina Press, 1972, pg. 492. Sailors from pirate Thomas Howard's ship Prosperous visited his plantation a few years later. Hearing that Van Tuyl had attacked some fellow pirates (possibly Thomas Mostyn), they fought with Van Tuyl and his men, who captured Tom Collins and David Williams before driving off the rest of Howard's men. Aert was last heard of in 1714. The newly enriched Otto returned to St. Maries in 1698 where he booked passage home on a merchant ship, arriving at New York City in June, 1699. Arrested by New York authorities, Otto evaded justice through good connections and bribery.\u201cEarl of Bellomont to the Lords of Trade,\u201d in Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New York, ed. by E.

Returning to Tulear, they captured a brigantine which they sank after looting it for supplies and slaves, again putting ashore anyone who refused to join them. They then cruised up the eastern coast of Africa taking several small ships. Returning to St. Augustine to careen, they beached the ship carelessly and broke its keel. Jones and Ryder\u2019s further activities are not known; one source said they later joined Culliford\u2019s crew. Among Jones' crew was future pirate Captain David Williams, who would also go on to sail with Culliford as well as under a number of other Madagascar-based pirate captains."]}, {"page": "Thomas Collins (pirate)", "response": ["*David Williams - another pirate who sailed with Howard and escaped Van Tuyl's plantation."]}, {"page": "John Pro", "response": ["Pro made his fortune as a pirate cruising the Indian Ocean against Moorish shipping, possibly alongside David Williams or Thomas Collins. They returned to the pirate trading post at Ile Ste Marie off the Madagascar coast to divide their treasure. Adam Baldridge had abandoned the settlement in 1697 after a Malagasy uprising, but Pro remained behind to rebuild. In 1703 Williams and Collins were captured by fellow ex-pirate Aert Van Tuyl after they and the crew of Thomas Howard\u2019s ship Prosperous got into a fight with Van Tuyl and his native allies. Escaping six months later, Williams made his way to Pro\u2019s outpost."]}]}}
