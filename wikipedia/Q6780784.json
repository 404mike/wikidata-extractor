Even with limited suffrage, after the First World War many Western women remain destined to a life of domestic servitude or limited careers. The Second World War gives women in Britain and the United States a brief opportunity to work in traditionally male industries, but they are promptly replaced at war's end. In the 1960s, new household appliances, higher education, and the book The Feminine Mystique inspires campaigns for equal pay and employment opportunities, such as the Dagenham strike. However, women would still need to struggle against discrimination and harassment in male-dominated careers. The pill helps women gain control of their fertility. In less developed places of the world, there are other issues of concern to women, including genital mutilation, dowry killings and infanticide; while in Iran, a legacy of gender equality is rolled back after the Islamic Revolution. The Fourth World Conference on Women shows how the aspirations and achievements for women vary between rich and poor countries. The introductory scene shows the 1970 Women's Strike for Equality.
