He was a right-handed medium pace bowler and a middle to lower order batsman. In 82 first-class matches he took 205 wickets with an average of 26.39 and a best of 7 for 58. He scored 1022 runs with an average of 16.48 and a high score of 101 not out. Throughout his career he was dogged by injuries, these forcing him into early retirement at the age of 28. He later played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland.\nBatting:\tRight-hand batsman\nBowling:\tRight-arm medium pace\nRelations:\tSon: LJ RatcliffeTeams:\tLancashire (Main FC: 1972-1980); Lancashire (Main ListA: 1972-1980); All teams\nLancashire Cap: 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lyon (cricketer)", "response": ["The batting was better in 1979 and Lyon's aggregate of 313 runs and average of 22.35 were his best in first-class cricket. Much of that improvement was due to one innings: against Warwickshire at Old Trafford, he was sent in again as a nightwatchman after Lancashire had been forced to follow on and two quick wickets had fallen. As at Weston three years earlier, Lyon not only survived but prospered: he made 123 and, after the deficit had been overhauled, shared in an eighth wicket stand of 158 with Bob Ratcliffe which remains the Lancashire record for that wicket in first-class cricket. Ratcliffe also scored the only century of his career in this innings. The wicket-keeping for Lyon was less satisfactory, though, and he made only 32 dismissals in the season. He lost his place to Scott for the last matches and was not offered a new contract at the end of the season."]}]}}
