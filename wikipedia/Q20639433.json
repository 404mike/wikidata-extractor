(1908\u20131980)", "response": ["York started 1976\u201377 poorly, and they were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most of the first half of the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an improvement in results, but after winning only 1 of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977\u201378 season also started poorly; York lost 7 of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches of the table and finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978\u201379; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3\u20131 at the City Ground. In 1979\u201380, York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, before finishing 17th. With the club 18th in the table by mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980."]}, {"page": "1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||14  || Chris Galvin"]}, {"page": "Chris Galvin", "response": ["Chris Galvin may refer to:", "*Chris Galvin (chef) (born 1958), English chef", "*Chris Galvin (footballer) (1951), English professional footballer"]}]}}
