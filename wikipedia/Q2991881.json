In 1969 the band needed a new bassist. He once quipped, \"I never even wanted to play the bass (laughter). The only reason why I started playing the bass was because there was nobody in Dunfermline who could do it (laughter).\" The band became known as Nazareth in 1970.He is the father of Lee Agnew, drummer for Nazareth since the death of the original drummer Darrell Sweet, who died in 1999.
