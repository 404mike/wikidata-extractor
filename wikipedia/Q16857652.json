In 1790 he took command of HMS Sheerness and in 1796 became flag captain of HMS Venerable under Admiral Adam Duncan and was heavily engaged at the Battle of Camperdown the following year. For his service in the battle, Fairfax was knighted and in 1801 was made a rear-admiral serving in the Baltic Sea but had made an enemy of Lord Spencer and was permanently placed in reserve. In 1810 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the Red and died in Edinburgh in 1813. His fourth son Henry Fairfax was made a baronet in 1836 in recognition of his father's service.Portrait of Vice-Admiral Sir William Fairfax, Bt (1739-1813), by William Grimaldi (1751-1830). Bonhams.

These books provide 3-D illustrations made of unfolding paper that allow for the child to feel as if the book is coming to life.  First created in the mid-thirteenth century, they were originally not intended for children until publisher Robert Sayer created Harlquinade in 1765.  With his creating of a \u201clift-the-flap\u201d book, he gave children a way to truly become involved with what they are reading.  From then, several other authors, such as William Grimaldi, designed their version of the pop-up book depicting elaborate scenes from page to page that allowed for the reader to determine the outcome of the story."]}, {"page": "Stacey Grimaldi", "response": ["Stacey Grimaldi was descended from the house of Grimaldi: he was the great-grandson of Alexander Grimaldi of Genoa, who quit that city after its bombardment by Louis XIV in 1684, and whose father of the same name had been doge of Genoa in 1671. He was born in the parish of St. James, Westminster, on 18 October 1790, and was the second son of William Grimaldi, miniature-painter, of Albemarle Street, London, by his wife Frances, daughter of Louis Barker of Rochester. Upon the death of his elder brother in 1835 the title of Marquis Grimaldi of Genoa and the claims on the family possessions in Genoa and Monaco became vested in him."]}, {"page": "Thomas Worlidge", "response": ["Worlidge's last work was his Antique Gems, a series of 182 etchings of gems from the antique (three are in duplicate). The series was published in parts, some of which seem to have been issued as early as 1754; but Worlidge died before the work was completed. It was finished by his pupils William Grimaldi and George Powle, and, printed on satin, was published by his widow in 1768 at the price of eighteen guineas a copy.In its original form the volume bore the title, A select Collection of Drawings from curious antique Gems, most of them in the possession of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom, etched after the manner of Rembrandt by T. Worlidge, printed by Dryden Leach for M. Worlidge, Great Queen Street, Lincolns Inn Fields; and M. Wicksteed, Seal-engraver at Bath, MD.CCLXVIII. The frontispiece, dated 1754, shows Worlidge drawing the Pomfret bust of Cicero; behind on an easel is a portrait of his second wife, Mary. No letterpress was included originally in the volume, but between 1768 and 1780 a few copies were issued with letterpress. After 1780 a new edition, but bearing the original date of 1768, appeared with letterpress in two volumes at five guineas each. The title-page omits mention of \u2018M. Wicksteed's\u2019 name, but is otherwise a replica of the first. Some of the old copper plates (108 in all) were reproduced in \u2018Antique Gems, etched by T. Worlidge on Copper Plates, in the Possession of Sheffield Grace, Esq.,\u2019 London, 1823, (privately printed). Charles William King in his Antique Gems (1872, i. 469) thought Worlidge's plates often inferior to those of Jonathan Spilsbury, and that the descriptions placed below contained some blunders."]}, {"page": "Grimaldi, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Grimaldi"]}]}}
