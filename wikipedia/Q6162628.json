The speech was filmed by undercover investigator Jason Gwynne and included in a 2004 BBC documentary, The Secret Agent. On 12 December 2004, these comments resulted in Tyndall being arrested on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred. That month, Tyndall was again expelled from the BNP, this time permanently. The police then charged him, although he was granted unconditional bail in April 2005. Tyndall died of heart failure at his flat\u201452 Westbourne Villas in Hove\u2014on 19 July 2005.

This success led to a large number of the National Democrats party, including Simon Darby and Martin Wingfield defecting to the British National Party from 1999 to 2003. After the 2004 elections, the BBC and Searchlight created a documentary called The Secret Agent, featuring Jason Gwynne infiltrating the BNP. In it, Griffin and Mark Collett made comments critical of Islam. Following the documentary, Barclays Bank froze the party's accounts. Collett and Griffin were acquitted on charges of incitement to racial hatred in 2006. The BNP branded the BBC \"cockroaches\". In Burnley, the BNP lost one of its councillors, Maureen Stowe, who left the party after claiming it was racist. She told The Guardian, \"I became a BNP councillor, like most people who voted for me, by believing their lies\". Following the 7/7 bombings in London, the BNP released fliers with the slogan; \"maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP\". Griffin claimed that this was the \"cost of voting Labour\", attacking the government for bringing the United Kingdom into an \"illegal\" Iraq War and for its immigration policies. YouGov claimed in 2006, that support for the party stood at up to 7%. Large gains were made in the 2006 local elections, where the BNP more than doubled its number of councillors and became the second party on the Barking and Dagenham council."]}, {"page": "Gwyn (name)", "response": ["*Jason Gwynne, British journalist"]}]}}
