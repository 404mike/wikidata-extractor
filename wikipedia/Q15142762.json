He studied in Brussels with Arthur De Greef before first working in England at the Lyceum Theatre where he was Musical Director. He also established a singing school in London in 1899 and was Musical Director for various theatre companies. His output consisted mainly of incidental music for plays including a number at His Majesty's Theatre under Sir Herbert Tree, including Trilby in 1895. His music was twice performed in London's Promenade concerts (in 1901 and 1911).\nR\u00f4ze was Musical Director of the Royal Opera House and his three-act opera Joan of Arc was premiered there on 1 November 1913. A review in the Times was very critical of the opera\u2019s disjointed nature and warned that \u2018a drama with the characters singing and an orchestra to accompany them is not necessarily an opera.\u2019 Later in the same month he engaged Frank Bridge to conduct Richard Wagner\u2019s opera Tannh\u00e4user. Joan of Arc received a further performance in Paris at a fundraising event for the Red Cross in 1917 but was ultimately unsuccessful. The opera was written in English at a time when there were few English operas in the repertoire. With his opera, R\u00f4ze sought, in his own words, to establish the \u2018English language in the position it should hold on the operatic stage once and for all\u2019. In the same 1913 season he conducted Bizet\u2019s opera Carmen in English. A gala performance of Joan of Arc in the presence of King George and Queen Mary in December 1913 was interrupted by suffragist protestors.R\u00f4ze was the founding conductor of the British Symphony Orchestra, a professional ensemble formed in 1919 from demobilised soldiers returning to London after World War I.He was married to a soprano, Louise Miles (nom de sc\u00e8ne Marie Sora), from New York. His daughter Marie-Louise Roze was also a soprano. Her second husband was the Belgium sculptor John Cluysenaar.", "link_mentions": {}}}
