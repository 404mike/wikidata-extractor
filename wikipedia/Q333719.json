Similarly, editor Otto Penzler published an essay by Child explaining that Jack Reacher was created deliberately in contrast to the prevailing trends in crime fiction. His name is short and commonplace, as opposed to quirky or unusual; Reacher's  personal ethics and wandering lifestyle are reminiscent of the chivalrous knight errant of medieval lore as opposed to an anti-hero tormented by addiction and haunted by past misbehavior.Otto Penzler (editor) The lineup: the world's greatest crime writers tell the inside story of their greatest detectives.

Child tends to agree with such observations: \"I was huge as a kid and Reacher's stature is me translated as a kid. I enjoyed being bigger and fighting shamelessly.
