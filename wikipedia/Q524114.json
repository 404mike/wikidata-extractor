Rock Hard called the album \"nice, but harmless\", and ultimately deemed it \"a mean disappointment\" as potentially the last Whitesnake album.

Produced by Gilmour along with Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas, the album features orchestrations by renowned Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, and lyrics principally written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson.

Due to the popularity of grunge, promoters were allegedly \"skeptical of [Coverdale and Page's] pulling power in a poor market for traditional heavy rock\". Thus, a \"financially viable\" tour was not possible. This was seconded by Pratt, who stated: \"It was originally meant to be an American and European tour, but it was booked as arenas and the ticket sales just weren't there.\" Conversely, Coverdale stated: \"The whole arrangement for the Coverdale\u2013Page project was to go directly to the theatres, to the stage, and nothing, not even a whisper, came from Jimmy's manager when the album was released.\" Coverdale blamed Page's manager for the lack of touring; he was allegedly unenthusiastic about the project and wouldn't commit to live dates. Pratt, meanwhile, stated that Page was content with performing in theaters, while Coverdale considered it \"downsizing\". Japanese dates for December 1993 were still tentatively booked, and according to Coverdale, it wasn't until he brought the matter directly to Page that the latter agreed to do the shows. These concerts marked the first time Page had played in the country since Led Zeppelin's 1972 Japanese Tour. Aside from Coverdale\u2013Page material, the seven shows also featured certain Whitesnake and Led Zeppelin songs. Despite the lack of any further touring, both Coverdale and Page intended to continue working together.

Released in August 1982 as an Icehouse album, Primitive Man reached No.\u00a03 on the National album charts and provided their international breakthrough single, \"Hey Little Girl\" which peaked at No.\u00a07 in Australia, No.\u00a02 in Switzerland, No.\u00a05 in Germany and top 20 in UK, Sweden and Netherlands.

She spoke about the \"wilderness\" of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim.

The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians.
