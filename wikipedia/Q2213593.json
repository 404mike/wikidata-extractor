The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \"one of the finest collections in the world\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \"garden rooms\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \"garden rooms\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\"", "Sackville-West and Nicolson found Sissinghurst in April 1930, after Dorothy Wellesley, their near neighbour and a former lover of Sackville-West's, saw the estate for sale. They had become increasingly concerned about encroaching development near their property Long Barn, near Sevenoaks, Kent. Their offer on Sissinghurst was accepted on 6 May and the castle and the farm around it were bought for \u00a312,375, using only Sackville-West's money rather than Nicolson's. The property was  in total. The house had no electricity, running water, or drains, and the garden was in disarray. Anne Scott-James notes their \"planting inheritance\" as \"a grove of nut-trees, some apple trees, a quince [and] a tangle of old roses\". The physical assets on the site were \"four buildings of beautiful mellow brick, part of a moat [and] various fine walls\". Clearing the ground took almost three years, but by 1939 the garden was largely complete, with the exception of the White Garden. Nicolson was responsible for the design and layout, while Sackville-West, at the head of her team of gardeners, undertook the planting. Simon Jenkins, the architectural writer, describes Nicolson's design as \"post-Picturesque, a garden not as an imitation of nature but as imitation of a house\", and suggests his thinking was much influenced by Lawrence Johnston's garden at Hidcote. Sackville-West's approach was plant-centred, within the constraints of her husband's plan, \"profusion, even extravagance and exuberance, within confines of the utmost linear severity\".", "The National Trust took over the whole of Sissinghurst \u2013 its garden, farm, and buildings \u2013 in 1967. Since then, the number of visitors has steadily increased. Anne Scott-James,  the author of the first non-Nicolson history of the garden, records 13,200 visitors in 1961, the year of Sackville-West's death, 47,100 in 1967, when the castle passed to the Trust, and 91,584 by 1973. It is now among the Trust's most popular properties, receiving nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. Although the increased foot traffic has necessitated the replacement of the grass paths with York paving stones, the entry fees generate considerable income which, under the terms of the handover, can only be expended on Sissinghurst. In 2008, Adam Nicholson described the estate as \"better funded than it has been since the 16th century\". Major works of reconstruction, such as the restoration of the Tower brickwork, and the cataloguing and conservation of the collection of books in the library, have been made possible by the availability of these funds.", "Although the estate as a whole is , the gardens themselves occupy only . Anne Scott-James sets out the principles of the design: \"a garden of formal structure, of a private and secret nature, truly English in character, and plant[ed] with romantic profusion\". As gardeners and landscapers, both Sackville-West and Nicolson were amateurs. Nicolson largely undertook the design and Sackville-West the planting. The landscape is designed as a series of \"garden rooms\", each with a different character of colour or theme, the enclosures being high clipped hedges and pink brick walls. The rooms and \"doors\" are so arranged as to offer glimpses into other parts of the garden.", "The Rose Garden was constructed on the site of the old kitchen garden from 1937. It terminates the north\u2013south axis running from the White Garden and concludes with a brick wall, designed by A. R. Powys and known as the Powys Wall, constructed in 1935. Old garden roses, those bred before 1867, formed the heart of the garden's planting. Such roses appealed not only for their lavish appearance, but also for their history. The informal and unstructured massing of the plants was Sackville-West's deliberate choice, and has become one of Sissinghurst's defining features. Roses were supplied by, among others, Hilda Murrell of Edwin Murrell Ltd., notable rose growers in Shropshire, and the florist Constance Spry from her home Winkfield Place. In addition to using established suppliers and receiving plants as gifts from friends, Sackville-West sometimes sourced specimens herself. Sarah Raven records Sackville-West digging up the hybrid perpetual rose 'Souvenir du Docteur Jamain' at an old nursery; Anne Scott-James noted that the rose had passed out of commerce and it was Sackville-West who returned it to cultivation. The Rose Garden is divided by the Roundel, constructed of yew hedging by Nicolson and Nigel in 1933. As elsewhere in the garden, the Trust has replaced the original grass paths with stone and brick, to cope with the increases in visitor numbers. Scott-James considered the roses in the Rose Garden \"one of the finest collections in the world\". The writer Jane Brown describes the Rose Garden, more than any other including the White, as expressing \"the essence of Vita's gardening personality, just as her writing-room enshrines her poetic ghost\"."]}, {"page": "Picture Post", "response": ["Hopkinson said that his photographers were thoroughbreds and that text could always be written after the event, but if his photographers did not come back with good pictures, he had nothing to work with.
