In 1963, a specimen was sent from Uganda to Middlesex Hospital to be cultured. Virus particles were identified in the cultured cells, and the results were published in The Lancet in 1964 by Epstein, Achong, and Barr. Cell lines were sent to Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who developed serological markers. In 1967, a technician in their laboratory developed mononucleosis and they were able to compare a stored serum sample, showing that antibodies to the virus developed. In 1968, they discovered that EBV can directly immortalize B cells after infection, mimicking some forms of EBV-related infections, and confirmed the link between the virus and infectious mononucleosis."]}, {"page": "Burkitt lymphoma", "response": ["Burkitt lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, particularly B lymphocytes found in the germinal center.

He was the first to describe a type of cancer that now bears his name Burkitt's lymphoma. This type of cancer was endemic in equatorial Africa and was the commonest malignancy of children in the early 1960s. In an attempt to find a cause for the cancer, Burkitt sent cells from the tumour to Anthony Epstein (b. 1921) a British virologist, who along with Yvonne Barr and Bert Achong (1928\u20131996), and after many failures, discovered viruses that resembled herpes virus in the fluid that surrounded the cells. The virus was later shown to be a previously unrecognised herpes virus, which is now called Epstein\u2013Barr virus. Surprisingly, Epstein\u2013Barr virus is a very common but relatively mild infection of Europeans.  Why it can cause such a devastating illness in Africans is not fully understood, but reduced immunity to virus caused by malaria might be to blame. Epstein\u2013Barr virus is important in the history of viruses for being the first virus shown to cause cancer in humans."]}, {"page": "Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize", "response": ["** Denis Parsons Burkitt, London / Uganda"]}, {"page": "School of Medicine (Trinity College Dublin)", "response": ["* Denis Parsons Burkitt (1911\u20131993), Irish surgeon"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Denis Parsons Burkitt||16/03/1972||28 February 1911 \u2013 23 March 1993"]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Denis Parsons Burkitt"]}, {"page": "Dennis Burkitt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Parsons Burkitt"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1972", "response": ["# Denis Parsons Burkitt"]}, {"page": "1974 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Denis Parsons Burkitt, , Member, Medical Research Council External Scientific Staff."]}]}}
