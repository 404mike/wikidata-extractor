In his time with Dundee, he played on the losing side in the final of the Scottish Cup in 1952, but then helped the team retain the Scottish League Cup later in the same year. He came into contention for international honours (with Dundee colleague Bill Brown one of his rivals hoping to replace Jimmy Cowan who had been usual custodian for Scotland in that post-war period) but ultimately Henderson never received a cap for his country. His time as a veteran at Dundee United was spoiled by a broken leg.", "link_mentions": {}}}
