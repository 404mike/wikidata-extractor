In his time with Dundee, he played on the losing side in the final of the Scottish Cup in 1952, but then helped the team retain the Scottish League Cup later in the same year. He came into contention for international honours (with Dundee colleague Bill Brown one of his rivals hoping to replace Jimmy Cowan who had been usual custodian for Scotland in that post-war period) but ultimately Henderson never received a cap for his country. His time as a veteran at Dundee United was spoiled by a broken leg.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Henderson", "response": ["Robert, Rob, Robbie, Bob or Bobby Henderson may refer to:", "*Bobby Henderson (footballer) (1917\u20132006), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle, Dundee FC)", "*Bobby Henderson (musician) (1910\u20131969), American jazz pianist", "*Bobby Henderson (activist) (born 1980), creator of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"]}, {"page": "Dundee derby", "response": ["|   1952 ||  Bobby Henderson || Unknown"]}, {"page": "1952 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||||Bobby Henderson"]}, {"page": "1952 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || Bobby Henderson"]}, {"page": "Bob Johnstone (goalkeeper)", "response": ["Johnstone had been brought to the Jags from the junior leagues in June 1933, a week after the previous goalkeeper, Scotland international John Jackson, was sold to Chelsea,R Johnstone (Partick Thistle, Scottish Football Snaps (Mitchell's Cigarettes), 1935, via Partick Thistle History Archive and immediately took over the place in the first team, going on to make 255 appearances for the club in all competitionsPlayers J, Partick Thistle History Archive and claim winner's medals in the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, both in the 1934\u201335 season;Partick Thistle Win The Glasgow Cup, The Glasgow Herald, 15 October 1934, via Partick Thistle History ArchiveQueen's in too big a hurry, The Sunday Post, 12 May 1935, via Partick Thistle History Archive His position began to come under threat from the young Bobby Henderson before regular football was suspended."]}]}}
