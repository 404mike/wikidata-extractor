A number of scholars have indicated that Dracula version of the vampire myth participates in antisemitic stereotyping. Jules Zanger links the novel's portrayal of the vampire to the appearance of Eastern European Jews in fin de si\u00e8cle England. Between 1881 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England had increased sixfold because of pogroms and antisemitic laws. Jack Halberstam provides a list of Dracula's associations with antisemitic conceptions of Jewish people: his appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and \"lack of allegiance\" to one country. In terms of his appearance, Halbertstam notes Dracula's resemblance to other fictional Jews; for example, his long, sharp nails are compared to those of Fagin in Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist (1838), and Svengali of George du Maurier's Trilby (1895), who is depicted as animalistic and thin."]}, {"page": "Gothic fiction", "response": ["The 1880s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to fin de siecle, which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time.
