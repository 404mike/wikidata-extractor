After two impressive seasons at Roots Hall, he was signed by Newcastle United for \u00a310,000 in April 1951, where Newcastle paid \u00a39,000 up front and \u00a31,000 when Davies made his full international debut, which he did against Scotland at Ninian Park, 18 months after joining Newcastle. Davies went on to play six times for Wales, his final cap coming against England in 1957.After seven seasons at Newcastle, where he played 157 league matches and scored 49 goals, Davies was sent to Swansea Town in October 1958 as part of the deal that took Ivor Allchurch to Newcastle. Davies spent four seasons at Swansea, before finishing his league career with two seasons at Carlisle United. In 1966, Davies left professional football, and joined non-league Merthyr Tydfil where he spent one season.\nAs of November 1970 he was player-manager of King's Lynn.In 1971, Davies emigrated to Perth, Australia, where he stayed in football and coached several local sides. He remained in Perth until his death on 9 February 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["In 1955, the club was rocked by the sudden death of manager McCandless, days after the players had returned to pre-season training. The Swansea board decided against appointing a permanent replacement, instead establishing a three-man selection committee consisting of Ron Burgess, Allchurch and Joe Sykes, with Burgess being given the title of \"team manager\". Under the guidance of the trio, the Swans were able to mount a serious promotion challenge, going unbeaten in eleven games between September and December 1955. However, following a serious injury to defender Tom Kiley, the committee fell out with the Swansea board over their refusal to provide funds to secure a replacement for Kiley, Burgess having transfers for Bob McKinlay and Jim Dugdale rejected by the board. The loss of Kiley and the conflict with the board saw Swansea lose 7 of their last 8 matches of the season, eventually finishing in 10th position. His growing frustration at the club's refusal to invest in the squad and a strained relationship with new manager Trevor Morris led Allchurch to announce his decision to leave the club, stating in his own newspaper column \"I am ready to admit that I had high hopes that my own club would get promotion a couple of years ago [...] then I would have been happy to end my career in the town [...] But that dream does not look like coming true\". Morris later used the money from Allchurch's transfer to sign Colin Webster and Reg Davies."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Reg Davies||||FW||1951\u20131958||171||50||"]}, {"page": "North Metropolitan Region (Western Australia)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"6\"|Reg Davies"]}, {"page": "Tommy Mulgrew", "response": ["Born in Motherwell, he started his football career with Morton in March 1948, before moving to England firstly with Northampton (from July 1949).
