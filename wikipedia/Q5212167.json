He disappeared in April 1912 while attempting to fly from Holyhead, Wales, to Ireland in a Bl\u00e9riot monoplane, and was presumed dead shortly after.Allen had initially set off from Hendon Aerodrome together with his friend and fellow pilot Denys Corbett Wilson who successfully completed his flight to Ireland, the first complete flight between Great Britain and Ireland, on 22 April. Although it was reported that their flights were the result of a wager between the two men, this was subsequently denied.The following week, on 26 April, Vivian Hewitt successfully completed a flight between Holyhead and Dublin, landing in the Phoenix Park. Interviewed by the press, he expressed the view that Allen had been insufficiently experienced as an aviator for a flight of such difficulty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denys Corbett Wilson", "response": ["Wilson had initially set off from Hendon Aerodrome on 17 April 1912 in his Bleriot XI monoplane in a race against his friend and fellow pilot Damer Leslie Allen, also flying a Bleriot, who disappeared the following day over the Irish Sea while attempting a flight from Holyhead, Wales to Ireland. Corbett-Wilson meanwhile was forced to land near Hereford and booked into the Mitre Hotel.  Rather than wait for his mechanic to arrive, he decided to purchase petrol and oil locally.  The oil (castor oil was used at the time) however turned out to be the wrong grade and on resuming his flight the following morning he was once again forced down because of engine trouble.  This time he landed in Colva, Radnorshire where he wisely waited for his mechanic to arrive.  It was on 21 April he took off and decided to head west instead of north for Chester and Holyhead as the original plan.  He arrived at a field near Harbour Village, Goodwick around mid-morning.  The historic flight to Ireland took place on the 22nd of April. Wilson began his flight at 6 a.m, taking off from Fishguard in South Wales.\u00a0 When he was 20 miles from the coast of Wexford he flew into a heavy storm. His compass went out of order so he flew blindly for 40 minutes until he eventually made a hasty descent in a field in Enniscorthy."]}, {"page": "Vivian Hewitt", "response": ["On 26 April 1912, Hewitt successfully completed a flight between Holyhead and Dublin, landing in the Phoenix Park.
