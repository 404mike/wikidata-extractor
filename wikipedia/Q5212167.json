He disappeared in April 1912 while attempting to fly from Holyhead, Wales, to Ireland in a Bl\u00e9riot monoplane, and was presumed dead shortly after.Allen had initially set off from Hendon Aerodrome together with his friend and fellow pilot Denys Corbett Wilson who successfully completed his flight to Ireland, the first complete flight between Great Britain and Ireland, on 22 April. Although it was reported that their flights were the result of a wager between the two men, this was subsequently denied.The following week, on 26 April, Vivian Hewitt successfully completed a flight between Holyhead and Dublin, landing in the Phoenix Park. Interviewed by the press, he expressed the view that Allen had been insufficiently experienced as an aviator for a flight of such difficulty.", "link_mentions": {}}}
