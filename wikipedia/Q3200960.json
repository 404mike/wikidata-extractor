By this time Carry On had become a leading film franchise, with the author Robert Ross describing it as a \"phenomenon\". That year's film, Carry On Regardless, was the fifth in the series; Jacques received a fee of \u00a3100 for the small role of a disgruntled hospital sister, who appeared briefly on screen alongside the English character actor Kynaston Reeves. Jacques was initially intended for a major part in the film, but she was unable to commit to a longer role because of ill health. She appeared in her sixth Carry On, Carry On Cabby, in 1963, as \"Peggy Hawkins\", the emotionally neglected wife of taxi-firm boss \"Charlie\", played by Sid James. Jacques later named the film as her favourite of the series, as she was allowed to drop her \"battleaxe\" persona and play the romantic lead opposite James."]}, {"page": "Gates to Paradise", "response": ["* Kynaston Reeves \u2013 Superior"]}, {"page": "Billy Bunter", "response": ["Billy Bunter was played by Gerald CampionReport of Gerald Campion's passing: ComicsUK.co.uk website.
