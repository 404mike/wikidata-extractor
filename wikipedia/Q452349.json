Lawson was a friend of Bennett, and when asked why he chose to perform Bothy Culture, he said:", "The bulk of the music was the result of two separate string sections, with numerous Scottish fiddlers leading the traditional melodies in one string section while accompanying soundscapes were provided by classical violins, double bass and cellos in the other.
