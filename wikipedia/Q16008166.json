He started to play the dulcimer around age twelve, and gained a lot of experience by playing in dance halls and busking in the early 1920s.  Over the course of his life he worked at various jobs, including driving buses, driving an ambulance for a children's home, and running a dance band.  His repertoire included traditional Irish and Scottish tunes, pop tunes, show tunes, and more.  He was \"discovered\" as part of the folk revival in the early 1970s, and helped inspire players of the younger generation such as John McCutcheon and Malcolm Dalglish.  McCutcheon described Cooper as \"the most complete dulcimer player\" he had met.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977 in music", "response": ["*date unknown \u2013 Jimmy Cooper, hammered dulcimer player, 70"]}, {"page": "List of hammered dulcimer players", "response": ["* Jimmy Cooper"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Cooper", "response": ["Jimmy Cooper may refer to:", "*Jimmy Cooper (musician) (1907\u20131977), Scottish hammered dulcimer player", "*Jimmy Cooper (footballer) (born 1939), Scottish football winger", "*Jimmy Cooper (boxer), American featherweight boxer from the 1940s and 1950s", "*Jimmy Cooper, lead character from the film Quadrophenia", "*Jimmy Cooper (The O.C.), fictional TV character from The O.C."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Jimmy Cooper, hammered dulcimer player"]}, {"page": "1977 in British music", "response": ["**Jimmy Cooper, hammered dulcimer player, 69/70Gifford, Paul M.
