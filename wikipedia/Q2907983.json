He played for the Magpies from 1949 to 1961, becoming something of a cult hero amongst supporters who nicknamed him 'Dazzler'. He was an instrumental part of the team that experienced much success in the 1950s, winning three FA Cups in a five-year period, which included scoring a goal in the 1955 FA Cup Final. He made a total of 410 appearances for the club, scoring 113 goals.\nAfter leaving Newcastle, Mitchell spent one season with Berwick Rangers before returning to Tyneside as player-manager of Gateshead.
