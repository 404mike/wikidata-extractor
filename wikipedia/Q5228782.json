Highly recruited nationally as a fullback prospect from Columbus West High School, Francis chose to attend his hometown university after being recruited by Woody Hayes.\nPlaying behind College Hall of Famer Bob Ferguson for two years, and a backfield that included future Pro Football Hall of Famer Paul Warfield and future American Football League legend Matt Snell (AFL), Francis did not break into the starting lineup until his senior year.  That year, Ohio State started out as the preseason AP #1 team in the country.  Although close losses to UCLA and Northwestern derailed Ohio State's national championship hopes that season, Francis\u2014in a backfield that still included Paul Warfield\u2014led the team in rushing, averaging over 5 yds/carry.  In 1962, David was the Big Ten rushing champion (5.2 yds per carry).\nFrancis' greatest achievement as an Ohio State football player was saved for his last game against arch-rival Michigan. Until the 2007 season, his 186-yard, two touchdown performance was the most yards gained by an Ohio State running back against Michigan.(Beanie Wells)  Most noteworthy about that performance, is that Francis, under complete exhaustion, collapsed untouched near the goal line in an open field run before he could tally his third touchdown.\nDrafted by the Washington Redskins, Francis played one year in the National Football League before his career was ended by injury.\nDavid is married to Polly Francis and lives in Fairview, Texas.  David has two sons and two stepsons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Francis", "response": ["*Dave Francis (born 1941), Ohio State Buckeyes football player"]}, {"page": "David Francis OSU", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Francis"]}, {"page": "1963 NFL Draft", "response": ["|align=center|91||Washington Redskins||Dave Francis||Back||Ohio State"]}, {"page": "List of Washington Football Team players", "response": ["|Dave Francis"]}, {"page": "Washington Football Team draft history", "response": ["| 7 || 7 || 91 || Dave Francis || FB || Ohio State"]}, {"page": "1962 Ohio State Buckeyes football team", "response": ["| Dave Francis || NFL || 7 || 91 || Fullback || Washington Redskins"]}, {"page": "List of Ohio State Buckeyes in the NFL draft", "response": ["| 7 || align=center|91 || Washington Redskins ||Dave Francis || RB"]}, {"page": "Ohio State Buckeyes football statistical leaders", "response": ["| 1962 || Dave Francis || Dave Francis || Joe Sparma || Paul Warfield || na"]}, {"page": "1962 All-Big Ten Conference football team", "response": ["* Dave Francis, Ohio State (AP-3)"]}, {"page": "1962 Big Ten Conference football season", "response": ["|Dave Francis||Back||Ohio State||7||91"]}]}}
