He made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Swindon Town on 27 February 1954. During his first four seasons he was only selected occasionally, although he made 15 appearances in 1955\u201356 as Orient won the Third Division South title. However, it was not until the 1957\u201358 season that Bishop became a regular first-team player, forming a strong defensive line with Welshmen Mal Lucas and Cyril Lea. By the time of Orient's 1961\u201362 campaign Bishop was ever-present, playing in all 49 of the club's matches as they won promotion to the First Division for the first time.\"The Men who Made Leyton Orient\", N Kaufman & A Ravenhill, Tempus, 2002 pp. 45\u201346"]}]}}
