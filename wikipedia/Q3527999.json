Carr only began playing first-class cricket in 1909 aged 37 for Kent County Cricket Club. A leg-break bowler who was one of the early proponents of the new googly delivery, he shot to fame in 1909 and enjoyed a short career in the years before the First World War. He was named one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 1910.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1909 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Warren Bardsley, Sydney Barnes, Douglas Carr, Arthur Day, Vernon Ransford"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Douglas Carr"]}, {"page": "Carr (name)", "response": ["*Douglas Carr (1872\u20131950), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Archie MacLaren", "response": ["The final match of the series was drawn, mainly because the pitch heavily favoured batting. MacLaren was involved in another selection controversy when the fast bowler Claude Buckenham was left out of the England team at his instigation. The Wisden match report described this decision as \"so grave a blunder that it is difficult to find words in which to speak of it.\" The Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, commented: \"A fatal blunder was committed in leaving out Buckenham\u2014a blunder for which it was generally understood that MacLaren was responsible. Experts occasionally do strange things and this was one of the strangest. The idea of letting England go into the field in fine weather, on a typical Oval wicket, with no fast bowler except Sharp touched the confines of lunacy.\" Further issues arose over MacLaren's handling of his bowlers, and Wisden suggested \"MacLaren was sadly at fault in his management of the England bowling\". Douglas Carr, a 37-year-old, was called into the team after some success in preceding games and on the premise that the Australians would be unable to play his googly. After Carr had initial success, MacLaren kept him bowling for a long period until the player tired and was easily punished by the batsmen.Down (1981), p. 123. In his only innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match ended, much of the blame for England's failures was apportioned to him.Down (1981), p. 124. In the series, he scored 85 runs at 12.14. The Oval match was his final Test match; in 35 games he had scored 1,931 runs at 33.87.

He also appeared in amateur sides put together by H. D. G. Leveson Gower against both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and in an end-of-season Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough. In the season as a whole he took 94 wickets at an average of 22.10 runs per wicket. \"Wiseacres, sprawled in their canvas chairs in front of the Stragglers Bar at Taunton, stroked leathery faces and said he would walk into the England team,\" says one account of that first full season. What made Greswell's bowling different was the very late movement that he achieved off the pitch. Bowling at \"deceptively languid medium pace\", he also used a lot of swing: \"He could exploit the element of surprise without appearing to try. He could knock over leg stumps and orchestrate dolly catches to short leg.\" The possibility of a call-up to the England Test side was not fanciful: in the Somerset match against the Australians at Bath, he took four Australian wickets for 11 runs in 13 overs, and the Australians, set just 68 to win the match, scraped home with only two wickets to spare. And the England selectors in 1909 were not averse to experimentation: later in the season, they picked Douglas Carr, another novelty bowler also in his first season of full-time cricket. Greswell did particularly well in two of the season's more visible matches. For Leveson Gower's team against Cambridge University at Eastbourne, he took six for 108 in the first innings and seven for 62 in the second: this was his first 10-wicket match (13/170), though this was a 12-a-side game (but still regarded as first-class). Then, in Somerset's match against Middlesex at Lord's, he took three for 59 and six for 96, and also hit exactly 100 in 75 minutes \u2013 the only century of his career."]}, {"page": "List of people from Cranbrook, Kent", "response": ["*Douglas Carr (1872\u20131950), cricketer."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Douglas Carr (1909\u20131913)"]}, {"page": "Kent County Cricket Club in 1909", "response": ["Two of the County's players Arthur Day and Douglas Carr were selected as Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1910 as a result of their performances during the season.
