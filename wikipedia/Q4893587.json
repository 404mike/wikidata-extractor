He was born in Manchester. His treatment of the cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas has been highly acclaimed.\nHe is also noted for his recordings of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Roberts' recording of the Well-Tempered Clavier, Books 1 and 2, performed on piano, was released in 1999 by Nimbus Records and was well received. Roberts also has recorded Bach's Six Partitas, BWV 825\u201330, and his French Suites, BWV 812\u201317. In collaboration with other performers, Roberts released discs of music for one and two pianos by Paul Hindemith and of trios by Frank Bridge.\nAccording to Roberts' official home page, he has been the subject of a 40-minute BBC2 documentary, and he \"particularly enjoys performing the piano trio repertoire with his sons Andrew and Nicholas\".\nRoberts commented that although he enjoyed making the Beethoven recordings, he feels his playing was somewhat restrained in the first \"direct cut\" recording.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Dodgson", "response": ["His music for wind band includes a four-movement Wind Symphony (1974). His orchestral output features a set of nine Essays for orchestra (five of which were recorded on a Dutton CD by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under David Lloyd Jones), each lasting around a quarter of an hour, in which Dodgson says he aimed \"to treat the orchestra boldly, as an integrated body and with ideas concentrated and unified more than contrasted\", in keeping with Francis Bacon's conception of the essay as \"dispersed meditations\". Other commercial recordings of cycles of Dodgson's works include the seven piano sonatas played by Bernard Roberts and the eight string quartets performed by the Tippett String Quartet."]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Bernard Roberts"]}, {"page": "Nimbus Records", "response": ["* Bernard Roberts"]}, {"page": "Machynlleth Festival", "response": ["Performers in the first three Machynlleth Festivals included  tenor Paul Agnew (1987),  oboist Nicholas Daniel (1988),  soprano Elizabeth Vaughan (1988),  actor Leonard Fenton (1988 and 1989),  saxophonist Don Rendell (1989) and  bass-baritone Bryn Terfel (1989).
