Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been included in the play in order to show how reckless the hero was and that this was the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. At the beginning of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths."]}, {"page": "1814", "response": ["* July 25 \u2013 Charles Dibdin, English composer (b. 1745)"]}, {"page": "1745", "response": ["** Charles Dibdin, English composer (d. 1814) "]}, {"page": "Blackfriars Bridge", "response": ["In 1774 the new bridge was mentioned in a popular song in Charles Dibdin's opera The Waterman,C.

The Pickle Clowns: New American Circus Comedy. p.\u00a011. Southern Illinois University Press. Astley's first competitor was equestrian Charles Hughes, who had previously worked with Astley. Together with Charles Dibdin, a famous author of pantomimes, Hughes opened a rival amphitheatre in London, which Dibdin called the Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy.", "Astley did not invent trick-riding, which was already a popular entertainment of the period. Nor did he originate the idea of performing in a circular 'ring'. The use of the circular arena is successful for two reasons. First, it is easier for the audience to keep the riders in sight. Second, the circular ring (though Astley called it 'the Ride') helps riders through the generation of centrifugal force, which assists them in keeping their balance while standing on the backs of their galloping horses. Astley never called his 'Astley's Amphitheatre of Equestrian Arts' a circus; that title was thought up by Charles Dibdin, who in partnership with Astley's rival Charles Hughes, opened the Royal Circus on 4 November 1782, a short distance from Astley's in Lambeth, London.Joe Nickell (2005).

Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Charles Coffey, Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.J. Warrack and E. West, The Oxford Dictionary of Opera (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.", "The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern \"jukebox musical\"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including folk melodies, popular airs by classical composers (such as Purcell) and even children's nursery rhymes. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London broadside ballads are set. It is from this connection that the term \"ballad opera\" is drawn. This ragbag of \"pre-loved\" music is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as \"Lillibullero\", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.  In 1762, Thomas Arne's Love in a Village presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's Lionel and Clarissa in 1768.", "Later in the century broader comedies such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Duenna and the innumerable works of Charles Dibdin moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera."]}, {"page": "Tom Bowling", "response": ["*An 18th-century song by Charles Dibdin"]}, {"page": "Lyceum Theatre, London", "response": ["The first Lyceum Theatre was housed in a building erected in 1765 on a site adjacent to the present theatre, with its entrance on The Strand, by the architect James Paine for the exhibitions of The Society of Artists.Pope, W.

Famed actor David Garrick also performed there. In 1794, the composer Samuel Arnold Sr rebuilt the interior of the building, making it into a proper theatre, but through the opposition of the existing patent theatres, he was not granted a patent. Therefore, he leased it to other entertainments again, including Philip Astley, who brought his circus there when his amphitheatre was burned down at Westminster. It was also used as a chapel, a concert room, and for the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussauds in 1802."]}, {"page": "Shiver my timbers", "response": ["The expression is a derivative of actual 18th century nautical slang, when the phrase \"timbers!\" or \"my timbers!\" meant an exclamation (cf. \"my goodness!\") as can be seen in Poor Jack, a song from 1789 by Charles Dibdin."]}]}}
