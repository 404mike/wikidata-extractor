He develops a genuine friendship with Kirk, even though Kirk outwardly holds his boring demeanour in some disdain. He often gives Kirk a lift home on his motorcycle combination due to Kirk's 'Porsche' always \"being in dock\". In series two, Ralphy (as Kirk calls him) makes a \"shrewd investment\" by buying a mobile discotheque from a friend and adopts the persona of disc jockey Dazzling Darren Dring; a name conjured up by Kirk. Unfortunately, he only has two records in his 'collection'; Green Door by Shakin' Stevens, and another unnamed track which is scratched so it is never played. His microphone patter and act are not nearly as glitzy as his name, unanimated and interjecting his performance with such comments as \"Get down\", \"Do that funky thing\" and \"Don't give me that jive, Clive\" in his normal monotone voice."]}, {"page": "Moody and Pegg", "response": ["* Peter Denyer as George"]}, {"page": "Romany Jones", "response": ["|  13 ||  5 ||  Not So Sweet Charity ||  Peter Denyer & Graham Hooson ||  "]}, {"page": "2009 in British television", "response": ["| Peter Denyer"]}, {"page": "The Fenn Street Gang", "response": ["The series follows the lives of many of the pupils from Fenn Street School as they enter the world of work.
