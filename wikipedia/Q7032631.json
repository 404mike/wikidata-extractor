However, some spectators were offended by the perceived aggressive nature of the spear-throwing gesture, and many considered it retaliatory against the booing he had received in previous weeks. It divided opinion among News Corp commentators, with many viewing it as inflammatory to the situation which had received particularly wide media coverage during the previous week. The booing of Goodes intensified in the months after the war dance, leading further public debate and to Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion calling the booers \"ignorant\". Goodes was surprised by the attention and negative reaction to his dance, and later apologised for any offence, saying that because he was depicting an \"Aboriginal warrior\" and the ceremony was a \"war cry\" it needed to be directed at the opposing team's players."]}, {"page": "Ron Boswell", "response": ["He was the leader of the National Party in the Senate from 10 April 1990 to 3 December 2007 and held many positions in the Coalition shadow ministry including Shadow Minister for Regional Development and External Territories (from September 1988 to April 1990), Shadow Minister for Northern Australia and External Territories (April 1993 to May 1994) and Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs (May 1994 to December 1994).

In practice, since the mid-1980s, CLP House members have sat with the Liberals while CLP Senators sit with the Nationals.
