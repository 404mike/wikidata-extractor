She created both title roles in Jan\u00e1\u010dek's K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1 and Jen\u016ffa in their respective British premieres. She has been described as \"the best English dramatic soprano since Eva Turner\" (her teacher).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eva Turner", "response": ["After retiring from the stage, she remained active in the industry, the following year, she was offered the position of visiting the Professor of voice at the University of Oklahoma, and a one-year contract was extended for nine years. She derived amusement from a misprint in a local newspaper which described her as \"Professor of Vice\", especially as she was later to say that she was \"not in demand\" except as a singer. She returned to London in 1959 where she was appointed Professor of Singing at the Royal Academy of Music, a position she held until aged well into her 80s. Her style of teaching was too forthright for some (Rita Hunter found it too demanding), but it produced such successful students as Amy Shuard, Roberta Knie, Janet Coster and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa. Shuard and later Dame Gwyneth Jones, both of whom had success in the role of Turandot, studied this part with her."]}, {"page": "The Royal Opera", "response": ["Despite Beecham's views, by the mid-1950s the Covent Garden company included many British and Commonwealth singers who were already or were soon to be much sought after by overseas opera houses.Temperley.
