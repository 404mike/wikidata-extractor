He was born at East Grinstead, Sussex.\nPayne made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Kent in 1869 at the Higher Common Ground, Tunbridge Wells. Kent won the toss and elected to bat first, making 116 all out. In response, Sussex made 152 all out in their first-innings, with Payne being run out during it for a duck. Kent then made an improved 304 all out in their second-innings, during which Payne bowled four wicketless overs, to set Sussex 268 for victory.  However, Sussex failed in their chase and were dismissed for just 118, with Payne being dismissed for 4 runs by George Bennett. This was his only major appearance for Sussex.\nHe died at the town of his birth on 25 June 1892.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Payne", "response": ["George Payne may refer to:", "*George Payne (Freemason) (1685\u20131757)", "*George Payne (racehorse owner) (1804\u20131878), English breeder of thoroughbred horses", "*George Payne (baseball) (1889\u20131959), American baseball pitcher and member of the Texas League Hall of Fame", "*George Payne (Australian footballer) (1893\u20131962), Australian rules footballer who played for South Melbourne", "*George Payne (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20131987), English footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Tranmere Rovers and Northwich Victoria", "*George Payne (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u20131932), former Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and Sunderland player", "*George Payne (cricketer) (1850\u20131892), English cricketer", "*George Payne (actor), American pornographic actor"]}]}}
