In a videotape recorded by Settelen in 1992, Diana said that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\" It is thought she was referring to Barry Mannakee, who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. Diana said in the tape that Mannakee had been \"chucked out\" from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair. Penny Junor suggested in her 1998 book that Diana was in a romantic relationship with Mannakee. Diana's friends dismissed the claim as absurd. In the subsequently released tapes, Diana said she had feelings for that \"someone\", saying \"I was quite happy to give all this up [and] just to go off and live with him\". She described him as \"the greatest friend [she's] ever had\", though she denied any sexual relationship with him. She also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that \"[He] made me feel so inadequate in every possible way, that each time I came up for air he pushed me down again.\""]}, {"page": "Charles, Prince of Wales", "response": ["Within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near 13-year age difference.

Later in the year, two thugs, Les Grimes (Mike Grady) and Neil Foxall (Terence Budd), broke into the Rovers in the night in search of valuables and money. Despite being unable to defend herself, Annie refused to be intimidated and defiantly told them her money was in the bank (in fact, there was money on the premises which she kept in a safe place). The thugs left after searching the place and finding nothing of value, and despite telling friends and staff she was fine Annie fell down the stairs the next day and was admitted to hospital. The brewery then discovered Annie's true living situation, however she was held in high enough esteem that she was offered the tenancy of a pub in Cheshire, rather than retirement. When informed of the brewery's decision by Warren Coates (Peter Settelen), an unflappable Annie immediately telephoned Douglas Cresswell, who put a stop to the plans.

In both, Elizabeth has a lot of sympathy for Wickham, perhaps more in the 1980 version where he is played by the blond Peter Settelen. He is shown playing croquet with Elizabeth who speaks fondly of Jane, who has just received a letter from Caroline, expressing the hope that her brother will marry Miss Darcy. Wickham says that being loved by Elizabeth would be a privilege because of her loyalty towards those for whom she cares.  A mutual attraction is more clearly seen in this adaptation than the 1995 adaptation.Sue Parrill 2002, p. 71 When Mrs. Gardiner warns against reckless commitments, as in the novel, her niece reassures her that she is not in love with Wickham, but adds, nonetheless, that the lack of money rarely prevents young people from falling in love. She calms her sisters, much more affected than herself by Wickham's courtship of Mary King, pointing out to them that young people must also have enough money to live on. Lydia, by contrast, seems to be already very interested in Wickham and tries to get his attention.Sue Parrill 2002, p. 72"]}, {"page": "The Voyage of Charles Darwin", "response": ["*Peter Settelen \u2013 Lieutenant Sullivan"]}, {"page": "List of Jackanory episodes", "response": ["|2876|| The Wheel on the School: Part 1 || Meindert DeJong || Peter Settelen || 31-Jan-83", "|2877|| The Wheel on the School: Part 2 || Meindert DeJong || Peter Settelen || 01-Feb-83", "|2878|| The Wheel on the School: Part 3 || Meindert DeJong || Peter Settelen || 02-Feb-83", "|2879|| The Wheel on the School: Part 4 || Meindert DeJong || Peter Settelen || 03-Feb-83", "|2880|| The Wheel on the School: Part 5 || Meindert DeJong || Peter Settelen || 04-Feb-83"]}, {"page": "Heil Caesar", "response": ["*Octavius Caesar: Peter Settelen "]}, {"page": "The One and Only Phyllis Dixey", "response": ["* Peter Settelen as Father McGuire"]}, {"page": "Settelen, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Settelen"]}]}}
