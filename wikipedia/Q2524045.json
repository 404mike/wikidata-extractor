He also produced albums for artists such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Jesus Lizard, the Stranglers, the Futureheads, Michael Hutchence, Killing Joke, Polysics, Fight Like Apes, Therapy? and the Young Knives.Gill was noted for a distinctive rhythm guitar style and sound, emphasizing a treble-heavy attack likened by one critic to \"metal splintering.\" He favored tight linkage with drums and bass, and unlike many guitarists shunned the \"warmer\" sound of valve amplifiers in favor of the \"coldness\" and \"thinness\" of a Fender Stratocaster through transistor amps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "response": ["The band released their debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, in August 1984.
