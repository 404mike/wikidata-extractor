Published in 1957, The Rise of the Novel is considered by many contemporary literary scholars as the seminal work on the origins of the novel, and an important study of literary realism. The book traces the rise of the modern novel to philosophical, economic and social trends and conditions that become prominent in the early 18th century.

Birns argues that it meets three aspects of Ian Watt's definition of the kind of novel read by the middle class, dominant among the reading public: firstly, it shows multiple social classes interacting; secondly, it is in a domestic context, the homely Shire; thirdly, it favours the point of view of the \"emerging and aspiring middle classes\". Birns concludes that \"'The Scouring of the Shire' is where Tolkien's dark romance bends the most towards the realistic novel of domestic reintegration and redemption.\" Plank writes that the distinctive feature of the \"Scouring\" is that unlike in the rest of the book, there are no miracles and the laws of nature work with \"full and undisputed force\".

And third, he attached great weight to the technologies of communication as instruments of psychological and social change.

However, Austen's novels did not conform to certain strong Romantic and Victorian British preferences, which required that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\".Duffy, 98\u201399; see also MacDonagh, 146; Watt, 3\u20134. Victorian critics and audiences were drawn to the work of authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot; by comparison, Austen's novels seemed provincial and quiet.Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 2; Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 1. Although Austen's works were republished beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 by Richard Bentley in the Standard Novels series, and remained in print continuously thereafter, they were not best-sellers.Johnson, 211. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 1, 20.", "In an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the status quo but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected.Litz, \"Criticism, 1939\u20131983\", 112; Stovel, 233. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked\".Irvine, 92. Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that in its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single women is seen as a problem.Irvine, 93. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer.Southam, \"Introduction\", Vol. 2, 129\u201331. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics.Johnson, 219; Todd. 20. They agreed that she \"combined [Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".Todd, 20.", "Ian Watt in his 1957 book The Rise of the Novel argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse.Irvine, 97\u201398. Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book The Rhetoric of Fiction, in which he offered a detailed study of Emma, which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator.Irvine, 95 Booth argued that Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader.Irvine, 95. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in Emma is related to the diction of the characters, with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character.Irvine, 99 A. Walton Ktiz argued that the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of Emma from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand Emma mind without becoming limited by it.Irvine, 99."]}, {"page": "Sociology of literature", "response": ["One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is The Rise of the Novel (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University.
