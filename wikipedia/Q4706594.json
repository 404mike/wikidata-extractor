By the time that darts had gained big popularity in the early 1980s, Evans's form had faded and he wasn't in the limelight as much as Eric Bristow, John Lowe and Jocky Wilson \u2013 who all found more fame and success from the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bullseye (British game show)", "response": ["| Alan Evans "]}, {"page": "Leighton Rees", "response": ["It was during his time working as a store man that Leighton found the sport of darts, becoming a regular for his local pub and county, and playing for Wales in 1970. It was not until 1972 though that he gained any real national attention. Sid Waddell, who later became a commentator for the BBC and Sky Sports, was at the time producer of Yorkshire Television's The Indoor League \u2013 a show with pub games tournaments. Waddell and his researchers had heard reports of a trio of great darts players in the South Wales valleys, an area that was quickly becoming a hotbed of talent for the sport. Waddell had already seen Alan Evans of Rhondda play at the Alexandra Palace during the 1972 News of the World Championship, the first darts tournament televised across Britain. The other two names mentioned were Tony Ridler of Newport and Leighton Rees of Ynysybwl.", "After twice winning the darts tournament on The Indoor League in 1974 and 1976, Rees turned professional in 1976 and reached the final of that year's News of the World Darts Championship, losing to Bill Lennard from Manchester. Rees was also part of the 1977 Wales team that won the very first World Darts Federation World Cup alongside Alan Evans and David \"Rocky\" Jones. ", "Rees' finest hour however would come in 1978 at the inaugural Embassy World Professional Darts Championship, in Nottingham. Seeded third he easily dispensed with Australian Barry Atkinson in round one at a score of 6\u20130 before taking on his close friend, Welsh team-mate and fifth seed Alan Evans in the second round. It turned into a classic with both players averaging over 90 per three darts (almost unheard of in those days). Evans took an early lead with a couple of 180s before Rees recorded the championship's first ever ten-dart finish (also the first ever televised) before eventually running out a 6\u20133 victor. At the time the BBC's executive producer Nick Hunter proclaimed it as the match that made darts live up to all their expectations and cemented it as a National TV item for years to come.", "In 1980, Rees married Debbie Ryle, a Californian, in Las Vegas while he was competing in a tournament there.  Eric Bristow was best man. Despite being the first world champion, it could be argued that Rees missed out on darts' glory years. The prize for his title was \u00a33,000 and as the prize money rose and tournaments began to spring up all over UK television channels, Rees' form began to slide and by the 1980s he never managed to match the continued success of Lowe, Bristow and Wilson. Rees was forced to make his living from playing exhibition matches with his compatriot and great friend Alan Evans."]}, {"page": "Eric Bristow", "response": ["*1979: Quarter Finals (lost to Alan Evans 1\u20133 sets)"]}, {"page": "Bob Anderson (darts player)", "response": ["*1987: Quarter-Finals (lost to Alan Evans 3\u20134)"]}, {"page": "Sid Waddell", "response": ["1972 was a big year for darts as ITV broadcast the News of the World Darts Championship for the first time.
