Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the Air Ministry, Hawker refined their monoplane proposal, incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft, including retractable landing gear and the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.

Earlier, during 1933, British aircraft designer Sydney Camm had conducted discussions with Major John Buchanan of the Directorate of Technical Development on a monoplane based on the existing Fury.Mason 1967, pp. 3\u20134. Mason attributes Camm's discussions with figures within the RAF, such as Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley, as having provoked the specification and some of its details, such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircraft's nose.Mason 1967, p. 4.", "* Fozard, John W., ed.

Two preliminary designs were similar and were larger than the Hurricane. These later became known as the \"N\" and \"R\" (from the initial of the engine manufacturers), because they were designed for the newly developed Napier Sabre and Rolls-Royce Vulture engines respectively.Mason 1991, p. 316. Both engines used 24 cylinders and were designed for over ; the difference between the two was primarily in the arrangement of the cylinders \u2013 an H-block in the Sabre and an X-block in the Vulture.Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12. Hawker submitted these preliminary designs in July 1937 but were advised to wait until a formal specification for a new fighter was issued.", "In August 1942, Hawker's second test pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while deputising for Chief Test Pilot Philip Lucas, carried out a straight and level speed test from Hawker's test centre at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around the tail of the aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up to the end of the Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its sleeve valves, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing."]}, {"page": "Brooklands", "response": ["*Sydney Camm (aircraft designer)"]}, {"page": "Hawker Tempest", "response": ["During development of the earlier Hawker Typhoon, the design team, under the leadership of Sydney Camm, had already planned out a series of design improvements; these improvements cumulated in the Hawker P. 1012, otherwise known as the Typhoon II or Thin-Wing Typhoon.Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 18, 105. Although the Typhoon was generally considered to be a good design, Camm and his design team were disappointed with the performance of its wing, which had proved to be too thick in its cross section, and thus created airflow problems which inhibited flight performance, especially at higher altitudes and speeds where it was affected by compressibility. The Typhoon's wing, which used a NACA 4 digit series wing section, had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 19.5 per cent (root) to 12 per cent (tip), in comparison to the Supermarine Spitfire's 13.2 per cent tapering to 6 per cent at the tip, the thinner design being deliberately chosen to reduce drag.J. A. D. Ackroyd. \"The Spitfire Wing Planform: A Suggestion.\" Journal of Aeronautical History, Paper No. 2013/02.Both the Spitfire and the Typhoon were designed when little was known about the behaviour of air at high subsonic Mach numbers, and of what would later become known as the Critical Mach number. The importance of this to high speed, high altitude flight would be discovered during combat in the Battle of Britain, where the Spitfire's thinner wing gave it an advantage at higher altitudes over the thicker wing-sectioned Hurricane, which was affected to a greater extent by compressibility. Fortuitously, the Spitfire had been designed with a thin wing that was subsequently discovered by the RAE to possess a high Critical Mach No. In addition, there had been other issues experienced with the Typhoon, such as engine unreliability, insufficient structural integrity, and the inability to perform high altitude interception duties.Mason 1967, p. 3.", "As a result of the termination of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest. Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine as an alternative to the liquid cooled engines which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest II prototypes were completed.Mason 1991, p. 337. Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding \"gills\". The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and was clean and effective.", "In 1944, in response to the issuing of Air Ministry Specification F.13/44, which sought a long-range fighter equipped with the Rolls Royce R.46 engine, Sydney Camm initiated work on a new design, designated as the P.1027. This was essentially a slightly enlarged Tempest which was powered by the R.46 engine, which was projected to develop around 2,500\u20134,000\u00a0hp (1,864\u20132,983\u00a0kW). This engine would have driven a pair of four-bladed contra-rotating propellers. The radiator was relocated into a ventral bath set underneath the rear fuselage and wing centre section: the wingspan was 41\u00a0ft (12.5\u00a0m) and the length was 37\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (11.4\u00a0m)."]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Sir Sydney Camm (1893\u20131966)"]}, {"page": "BAC TSR-2", "response": ["Aeronautical engineer and designer of the Hawker Hurricane Sir Sydney Camm said of the TSR-2: \"All modern aircraft have four dimensions: span, length, height and politics.

Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them.Mason 1991, pp.\u00a0355\u2013356. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter.
