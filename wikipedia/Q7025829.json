However, after reading the script, director Nicholas Mallett persuaded producer John Nathan-Turner that given the settings involved, the serial could be made more effective and realistic by shooting the entire production on location, to which Nathan-Turner eventually agreed. Shooting on the serial went over-length to such a degree that consideration was briefly given to editing the story into five rather than four episodes. However, Ian Briggs strongly opposed this, feeling that the narrative flow would be badly disrupted.", "The Curse of Fenric was released on VHS in 1991. The release included about six minutes' worth of the extra scenes. This story was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in October 2003 in a two-disc set as part of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary Celebration releases. This consisted of the original four broadcast episodes, with an additional DVD commentary recorded by Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred and Nicholas Parsons, plus a 'Special Edition' edited into one movie-length adventure including 12 minutes of unbroadcast material. This version has reworked special effects and music arranged by Mark Ayres based on notes written up by himself and the late Nicholas Mallett; it also sees several scenes re-edited to produce a more coherent narrative. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 39 on 30 June 2010."]}, {"page": "Christien Anholt", "response": ["|Nicholas Mallett"]}, {"page": "Mallett, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Mallett"]}]}}
