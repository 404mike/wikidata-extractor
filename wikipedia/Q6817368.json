He is best known for directing the excavation of the Etruscan 6th-century BC shipwreck off Giglio Island, Italy, the oldest known shipwreck of the Archaic era, and the Hoi An Cargo which revolutionized the understanding of Ming-Vietnamese porcelain from Vietnam's art-historical Golden Age.Bound became more involved in deep-ocean archaeology.  In 2014\u201315, he led a search for the Imperial German East Asia Squadron, sunk during the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914, and since then in AUV and ROV surveys in depths up to 6000 m. He eventually located the squadron's flagship, SMS Scharnhorst, in April 2019, 105 years after her sinking.He was in Antarctica as director of exploration for the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019, the main task being the study of the Larsen C Ice Shelf and second finding Ernest Shackleton's ship, Endurance, which sank under the ice in 1915.  Although they succeeded in cutting through the pack to the point where the Endurance sank, the hunt had to be abandoned when the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) conducting the seabed search failed to arrive at a programmed rendezvous point with the ship.Discovery Channel has called Bound \"the Indiana Jones of the Deep\".", "link_mentions": []}}
