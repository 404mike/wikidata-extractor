His was a paradoxical life, of self-exile and exile, and of writing on and (as often taken) against Judaism. He was influenced by the racialist theories of Arthur de Gobineau. He also admired Benjamin Disraeli, two of whose novels he translated into the German language.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard", "response": ["The first academic to draw attention to Kierkegaard was fellow Dane Georg Brandes, who published in German as well as Danish.

He wrote a trilogy of critical works on the theme of America (1923\u201325) believing that America was a natural 'biological' connecting link, or 'Bridge', between Germany and England.

P. Telotte, Animating Space: From Mickey to Wall-E. (University Press of Kentucky, 2010) pp.223-4.

Jahrgang, 1. Halbjahr, S. 11-17. and it was also very clear to Levy that Scheffauer still retained a fair share of American puritanism that so animated all of his criticism. Scheffauer's collection of essays: The New Vision in the German Arts (London,1924) was testimony to this unique German-American poetical and philosophical sensibility.See \"Expressionism for America\".
