It was originally intended that Great Britain would be represented by the England national team. However, in a final trial game, England were beaten 6\u20130 by a Rest of Great Britain team featuring Purcell. This subsequently saw Purcell included in the Olympic squad. Although representing Great Britain, pictures from the Olympics, show Purcell wearing a swimming costume with a shamrock and the word \"Ireland\" on it. In the Olympic final, Great Britain beat Belgium 3\u20132 to win the gold medal. Other members of the team included Charles Sydney Smith, Paul Radmilovic, Charles Bugbee, Christopher Jones, William Peacock and William Henry Dean.David Needham: Ireland\u2019s First Real World Cup -The Story of the 1924 Ireland Olympic Football Team (2012, The Manuscript Publisher) "]}, {"page": "William Dean", "response": ["* William Henry Dean (1887\u20131949), English water polo player"]}]}}
