The Department of Ancient History had continued after the split with Prehistory had appointed several classical archaeologists that also taught and researched in conjunction with the Department of Prehistory and Archaeology: John Cherry, Ian Sanders, David Kennedy, and John Lloyd all joined and led major archaeological projects. National cuts to universities in the UK through the 1980s however meant the closure of the Department of Ancient History in 1988 with some staff deciding to leave Sheffield and others merging into the Department of Prehistory and Archaeology. In the 1980s, the Department changed its name to the Department of Archaeology and Prehistory, marking a change to its research emphasis. This change ushered in a strengthening of materials research in the Department of Archaeology and Prehistory during the 1990s with the appointment of Barbara Ottaway to teach metallurgy and later Caroline Jackson in glass. Further appointments through the 1980s and 1990s increased the specialities of the Department: Glynis Jones (palaeobotany), Paul Halstead (zooarchaeology), Mark Edmonds (landscape and Neolithic archaeology), John Moreland (medieval archaeology), Mike Parker Pearson (prehistoric archaeology), Marek Zvelebil (prehistory and agriculture), Maureen Carroll (Roman archaeology), and Andrew Chamberlain (human osteology), Kevin Edwards (palaeoenvironments), and John Barrett (archaeological theory and British Bronze Age) expanded the range of specialisms in the department.", "|Keith Branigan, Paul Mellars, Mike Parker Pearson, Marek Zvelebil", "|Marek Zvelebil"]}]}}
