Actually married women were not required to pay tax in Britain at that time. According to the law the joint income of a couple was added together and the husband paid the tax. However Elizabeth who earned more than her husband refused to tell her husband how much she earned. This put the authorities into a quandary as Elizabeth was not liable to pay tax and her husband said he was willing to pay the tax but he said that he had no idea how much to pay. In 1910 the authorities illegally seized some of Elizabeth's goods in an attempt to levy the tax on her income. The authorities then tried to claim the tax either from the Wilks or by her husband alone. This was legally unsatisfactory as Mark was being asked for tax on an income of about \u00a3600 per annum that he was nominally unaware of. Then 3,000 teachers signed a petition when Mark Wilks was placed in Brixton prison and there was a demonstration in Trafalgar Square to protest at his treatment. He was released after a fortnight to a celebrations from the supporters of the Women's Tax Resistance LeagueHilary Frances, 'Wilks , Elizabeth (1861\u20131956)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Nov 2017 which included George Bernard Shaw.", "*Elizabeth Wilks"]}, {"page": "Headley Down", "response": ["*Elizabeth Wilks died here having given the village sixteen new cottages and ten acres of woodland."]}, {"page": "Wilks, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Wilks"]}, {"page": "Sarah Benett", "response": ["In her later years Sarah Benett lived in Finchley in North London.
