He had worked at the University of Cambridge, the British Museum, and the Institute of Archaeology of University of London, before ending his career as Professor of Human Palaeoecology at the University of York. He has been described as \"one of the pioneers in the field of archaeological science\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lindow Man", "response": ["Archaeologist Don Brothwell considers that many of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27\u00a0bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4th\u00a0centuries. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.", "British archaeologist and anthropologist Don Brothwell\u2019s The Bog Man and the Archaeology of People provides an account of the modern scientific techniques employed to conserve and analyse Lindow Man.  Celtic history, language and lore scholar Anne Ross and archaeological chemist Don Robins's The Life and Death of a Druid Prince provides an account of the circumstances surrounding Lindow Man's life and death, in part hypothesising that he had lived as a highborn, perhaps even as a druid who was sacrificed to the gods at the time of the Menai Massacre and Boudica\u2019s rebellion."]}, {"page": "V. Gordon Childe", "response": ["Childe's biographer Sally Green found no evidence that Childe ever had a serious intimate relationship; she assumed he was heterosexual because she found no evidence of same-sex attraction. Conversely, his student Don Brothwell thought him to be homosexual. He had many friends of both sexes, although he remained \"awkward and uncouth, without any social graces\". Despite his difficulties in relating to others, he enjoyed interacting and socialising with his students, often inviting them to dine with him. He was shy and often hid his personal feelings. Brothwell suggested that these personality traits may reflect undiagnosed Asperger syndrome."]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Don Brothwell (1933\u20132016) British; paleopathology"]}, {"page": "1933 in archaeology", "response": ["* Don Brothwell, British archaeologist (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "Joann Fletcher", "response": ["In 2003, Fletcher and a multidisciplinary scientific team from the University of York, including the forensic anthropologist, Don Brothwell, took part in an expedition to the Valley of the Kings in Egypt that was sanctioned by Zahi Hawass, then head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA). The investigation pursued a hypothesis put forward by Fletcher that one of the three mummies studied could be the mummified body of Queen Nefertiti. All three of the mummified bodies had been found among a cache of mummies in tomb KV35 in 1898. The team's scientific findings supported this and the hypothesis was included in the official report submitted to Hawass and the SCA shortly after the 2003 expedition. The expedition, the result of 12 years of research, was funded by the Discovery Channel, which also produced a documentary on the findings."]}, {"page": "HM Prison Lincoln", "response": ["* Don Brothwell; British archaeologist who was imprisoned after refusing the call-up for National Service as a conscientious objector"]}, {"page": "Threefold death", "response": ["Alfred Dieck claimed a high number of up to 1,860 known bog bodies in Europe. Archaeologist Don Brothwell considers that many of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The physical evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it does not explain why he was killed. Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice, although there is division in the academic community over this issue and in the case of Lindow Man, whether the killing was murder or ritualistic is still debated. Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the \"triple death\" (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to several different gods. The wide date range for Lindow Man's death (2\u00a0BC to 119\u00a0AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s\u00a0AD. As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice, this opens up other possibilities; this was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death."]}, {"page": "Guanche mummies", "response": ["In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo discovered several incisions in some mummies that he speculated may have been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Don Brothwell, 82\u201383, archaeologist."]}, {"page": "2016 in archaeology", "response": ["* September 26 \u2013 Don Brothwell, British archaeologist (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2016", "response": ["*Don Brothwell, 83, British archaeologist.Don Brothwell remembered"]}, {"page": "Donald Reginald Brothwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Don Brothwell"]}, {"page": "Donald Brothwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Don Brothwell"]}, {"page": "Brothwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Don Brothwell"]}, {"page": "Epidemiology of plague", "response": ["In the first century AD, Rufus of Ephesus, a Greek anatomist, refers to an outbreak of plague in Libya, Egypt, and Syria.
