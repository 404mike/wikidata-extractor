Ivan Butler in his Cinema in Britain  called it 'A minor Ealing perhaps even a little tired towards the evening of their long comedy day but a very pleasant sunset for all that.'  George Perry in his history of the Ealing Studios, Forever Ealing, compared it to Whisky Galore and Passport to Pimlico, as this film shares \"the theme of the small group pitted against and universally triumphing over the superior odds of a more powerful opponent.' But, quoting a location report by Hugh Samson of Picturegoer, he suggests there was a lack of sympathy for the subject: \"Odd point about this railway location: not a single railway enthusiast to be found in the whole crew. T.E.B.'Tibby' Clarke, writer of the script, loathes trains. Producer Michael Truman can't get out of them fast enough. And director Crichton - well, you wouldn't find him taking engine numbers at Paddington Station.\" Charles Barr in Ealing Studios felt that the film did not identify with audiences who, for instance in Passport to Pimlico, were yearning for the end of rationing; \"There is no grasp of a living community, or of the relevance of the train to people's daily needs.\""]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Film", "response": ["| The Divided Heart || Charles Crichton || Michael Truman ||  United Kingdom", "| The Maggie || Alexander Mackendrick || Michael Truman ||  United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "Ian Hendry", "response": ["| Directed by Michael Truman"]}, {"page": "Truman (surname)", "response": ["*Michael Truman (1916\u20131972), British film producer"]}, {"page": "Heather Sears", "response": ["After graduating from drama school, Sears was active from 1955 onward in the Windsor repertory theatre.
