A confident, well-dressed man he was at home with all types of horses and self-possessed enough to move smoothly between his aristocratic clientele. He prospered attributing his success to clients that included: the Earl of Derby, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Portland and most importantly Edward VII for whom he painted his Derby Stakes winner Minoru in 1909. It established him as a major painter of racehorses, a relatively small field that included his friend Alfred Munnings, Emile Adam, Lionel Edwards and Raoul Millais. Palmer created a niche for himself and his style and subject matter rarely deviated for the remainder of his career."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Raoul Millais (1901-1999), portrait painter and equestrian artist"]}]}}
