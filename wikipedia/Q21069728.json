His colleagues were Charles Kimber, followed by John Miller then Hawker, who had been studying mineralogy in England. He has been reported as one of the first three members elected after the passing of the Payment of Members Act. He was returned by a large majority at the general election in the following year. One of the first debates in which he made his presence was Sir John Downer's Divorce Bill, to which he had a strong opposition. He was regarded as a fluent debater, though at times rather excitable, with a reputation for thoroughness and honesty. In 1892 he was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands in the short-lived Holder cabinet, the youngest minister to that time, and reappointed to that role in the Kingston cabinet the following year. His administration of the Land Acts was marked by conspicuous ability, but his name was principally associated with the Village Settlements scheme of 1894."]}]}}
