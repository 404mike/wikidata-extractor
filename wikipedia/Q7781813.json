He regarded it as a spiritual war, the 'Good'of Britain and her allies facing the wickedness of Germany and, therefore, fighting for a choice between '...public law or military licence...freedom or absolutism, independence or servitude, truth or falsehood, purity or corruption, faith or force, love or hate, Christ or Beliel...'Carlisle Diocesan Gazette, July 1915.

These included his own sons, Reginald, who won a MC as a chaplain, and Philip, who was a major in the Border Regiment;and Theodore Hardy, vicar of Hutton Roof, who was awarded the VC.  His assistant, the Bishop of Barrow-in-Furness, who volunteered as a Chaplain and served with the Church Army, and the Vicar of Ambleside, who worked in a munitions factory during the week and returned to his parish at weekends to take services, were praised.  Unlike most of his colleagues, he refused to forbid his clergy from joining the forces as combatants, writing 'If it is wrong for a clergyman to enlist, can he encourage others to enlist?  If we honour and praise the dead for a sacred cause how can it be wrong for clergy to enlist in so noble a cause?'.Carlisle Diocesan Chronicle, December, 1915  Diggle also refused to accept candidates for ordination if they were 'of military age and medically fit at this critical juncture in the nation's needs'.Op cit June 1916  One of Diggle's last tasks was to join President Wilson of the USA in the nonconformist chapel where Wilson's ancestors had worshipped, and was widely criticised since he was a CofE bishop.
