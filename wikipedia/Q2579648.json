He also wrote numerous technical pieces on naval technology and strategy and was also noted for his articles concerning racial politics in the Southern United States. Despite having trained as a lawyer, Clowes had always preferred literature and writing, publishing his first work in 1876 and becoming a full-time journalist in 1879. For the services rendered in his career, Clowes was knighted, awarded the gold medal of the United States Naval Institute and given a civil list pension.

Clowes also maintained that in any contention between a ship carrying the commander and another, it was the responsibility of the other ship to keep clear from the path of his commander. Although this particular form of turn was not included in the official manoeuvering book, it was mentioned in other standard texts of seamanship.Hough p. 164. This view has been taken by others, who have added to the argument Tryon's behaviour, which was consistent with his having set a TA problem for his subordinate to solve and therefore followed his normal habit of not explaining his intentions or intervening until afterwards. Others have argued that the witnesses' accounts suggest Tryon accepted having made a mistake, and that had one column of ships passed outside the other instead of both turning inwards, they would then have been in the wrong formation to approach their normal positions at the anchorage.Gordon p. 270. Debate has also centred upon whether the flag signals instructions \"...preserving the order of the fleet\" imply that afterwards the ships should be in two columns as before (i.e. Camperdown in the starboard column) or whether the signals only meant that each division should still be in one column with the same order of ships, but that it could have swapped sides with the other column.Gordon pp. 268\u2013269."]}, {"page": "Battle of San Domingo", "response": ["The victory, just four months after the success at Trafalgar, was celebrated in Britain and across the Empire, particularly in the Caribbean. Mere rumours of Leiss\u00e8gues' presence had stifled trade and caused panic among the merchant houses of the West Indies and Duckworth's victory helped to restore confidence in commercial ocean travel once more.Rose, p. 39 In Britain both the House of Commons and the House of Lords voted their thanks to the entire squadron when Duckworth's account of the action was read out, the motions led by Lord Grenville and Charles Grey, who both made expansive speeches in praise of Duckworth. Head money, a bounty on enemy servicemen killed, wounded or captured, was paid for 4,268 men, even though records showed that the French fleet carried significantly fewer men than that. Additional prize money was paid for the captured Jupiter and awards of money, ceremonial plate and ornate swords were made by patriotic societies and Lloyd's of London insurers. Admiral Louis was made a baronet and Cochrane a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, while a number of promotions were distributed among the first lieutenants.James, Vol. 4, p. 200 Duckworth, however, received nothing beyond his share of the general rewards. Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in chief of the Mediterranean, was furious that Duckworth had deserted his post off Cadiz, failed to bring Willaumez to battle in December and then sailed for the West Indies to resupply rather than returning to the Spanish coast.  Historians William James and William Laird Clowes both considered that if Duckworth had not defeated Leiss\u00e8gues he would probably have faced a court martial.Clowes, p. 193  Duckworth's absence forced Collingwood to divert some of his own ships to the Cadiz blockade. The force provided still proved inadequate \u2013 on 26 February a French frigate squadron broke out of the port and escaped to Rochefort.Gardiner, p. 25 Collingwood's influence was enough to block additional rewards to Duckworth, who subsequently returned to the Mediterranean and in 1807 commanded the fleet at the ineffectual Dardanelles Operation.Duckworth, Sir John Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, A.

Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking a squadron of British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 29 Linois was concerned throughout the engagement for the safety of his ships: with the nearest dockyard over  away at \u00cele de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled.Maffeo, p. 191 He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force.James, Vol. 3, p. 250 Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that \"it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois\"James, Vol. 3, p. 251 and William Laird Clowes said in 1900 that \"his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity\".Clowes, p. 339 Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that \"his [Linois's] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was.\" He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that \"Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least \u00a38 million through mere timidity\". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decr\u00e8s on the subject, stating:"]}, {"page": "Action of 25 September 1806", "response": ["It took some time for the British squadron to effect repairs on their ships and prizes in preparation for the journey back to Britain. They had suffered light casualties of nine killed and 29 wounded, but among the more seriously injured was Hood, whose arm had been amputated during the battle. French losses were much heavier but are unknown: Hood did not include them in his official report but promised to provide them soon afterwards in a follow up letter, which, if it was written, has never been located.James, p. 264 All four of the captured frigates were large new vessels that were immediately purchased for service in the Royal Navy, Gloire and Armide retaining their names while Infatigable became HMS Immortalite and Minerve became HMS Alceste. Although Hood and his men were commended at the time, subsequent historical focus has been on the bravery of the inexperienced French crews in resisting an attack by an overwhelming force for so long. William James wrote in 1827 of the \"gallant conduct on the part of the French ships\" and William Laird Clowes, writing in 1900 stated that \"The resistance offered by the French to a force so superior was in every way credible\".Clowes, p. 391James, p. 266"]}, {"page": "Battle of Groix", "response": ["More controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient]. His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, \"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\" (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\" Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hy\u00e8res fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.Mostert, p. 164Woodman, p. 61"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Basque Roads", "response": ["In Britain, Gambier's conduct has been criticised by historians ever since the battle. For example, William Laird Clowes, wrote in 1901 that \"there can be no question that affair of Aix Road was mismanaged by the Admiralty at home and by the Admiral on the spot\" and that \"a great naval commander never loses an occasion to attack when conditions are favourable to him.\" In 2007 historian Noel Mostert wrote \"Oh Nelson! Nelson, Nelson, where were you? Never could the absence of the man from a scene of action clearly designed for his drive and decision have been more painfully alive.\"Mostert, p. 565 In the same year, David Cordingly wrote that \"The boldness of the attack . . . was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair.\"Cordingly, p. 205 Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy. Years later, Napoleon wrote to an English correspondent that Cochrane \"could not only have destroyed [the French ships], . . . but he might and would have taken them out, had your admiral supported him as he ought to have done . . .
