Baden-Powell authored the first editions of the seminal work Scouting for Boys, which was an inspiration for the Scout Movement.Educated at Charterhouse School, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. Several of his books, written for military reconnaissance and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys. In August 1907, he held a demonstration camp, the Brownsea Island Scout camp, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting. Based on his earlier books, particularly Aids to Scouting, he wrote Scouting for Boys, published in 1908 by Sir Arthur Pearson, for boy readership. In 1910 Baden-Powell retired from the army and formed The Scout Association.\nThe first Scout Rally was held at The Crystal Palace in 1909. Girls in Scout uniform attended, telling Baden-Powell that they were the \"Girl Scouts\". In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell started the Girl Guide and Girl Scout organisation. In 1912 he married Olave St Clair Soames. He gave guidance to the Scout and Girl Guide movements until retiring in 1937. Baden-Powell lived his last years in Nyeri, Kenya, where he died and was buried in 1941.  His grave is a national monument.Baden-Powell is the great-grandfather of Gerard Baden-Clay, known for murdering his wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 22", "response": ["*1857 \u2013 Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, English general, co-founded The Scout Association (d. 1941)"]}, {"page": "January 8", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, English general and founder of the Scout movement (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1941", "response": ["** Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, English soldier; founder of the Scouts (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "Lord Baden-Powell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell"]}, {"page": "Robert Baden Powell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell"]}, {"page": "Lord Baden Powell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell"]}, {"page": "William Henry Smyth", "response": ["*Henrietta Grace (1824\u20131914), who married Baden Powell and was mother of nine, including Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell"]}, {"page": "Charles Piazzi Smyth", "response": ["Smyth's brothers were Warington Wilkinson Smyth and Henry Augustus Smyth.
