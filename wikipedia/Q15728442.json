Formed in 1980, the group was an early band of the glam metal genre, starting off about the same time as bands of the genre such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\nIn their home country, the band's speciality was in its D.I.Y. aesthetic (common for many NWOBHM bands), over the top stage shows, and striking image. During their early days, they would often play in pubs but still used confetti, pyrotechnics, and dressed in full glam metal gear, including their trademark platform boots and huge, teased hair.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Discharge (band)", "response": ["With the release of Ignorance, Purtill and Maloney left the band to form the punk/metal crossover band HellsBelles, to be replaced by guitarists Les \"The Mole\" Hunt and drummer Michael \"Micky\" Gibson. Following the later addition of second guitarist Stephen \"Fish\" Brooks, they released 1986's Grave New World, a mainstream metal album with a glam sound from Morris's high-pitched singing style. The album reached the indie top 10, but the band struggled with personnel problems as Morris departed and was briefly replaced by ex-Wrathchild frontman Rob \"Rocky Shades\" Berkeley the following year. The group disbanded shortly thereafter."]}, {"page": "Wrathchild", "response": ["Wrathchild was formed in November 1980 in Evesham, Worcestershire, by Marc Angel and Philip Vokins.

They recorded the demo Dead Good which was featured on their Myspace website for a short time. The line-up included Rocky Shades, Jon Sudbury and James Crofts. They were set to play the Hard Rock Hell III festival in December 2009, but were removed from the bill in October; reason as quoted by Hard Rock Hell promoters \"All involved in Hard Rock Hell felt that without being able to use the name to advertise, and without more than one member of the original line-up in the band, what we were left with was simply not what we booked. It\u2019s as if we had booked Genesis and got Phil Collins. Hence it was not a proper booking, to which the agent who booked it agreed to.\"", "In December 2010, Rocky Shades decided to start afresh by creating a new band with no relation to the Wrathchild name, Wildside Riot. The initial line-up was Rocky Shades on vocals, Gaz Wilde (Gary Hunt) on drums, Iggie Pistolero and Rob D'Var on guitars. Natt Kid took on bass duties initially, eventually replaced by James Crofts (previously of Rocky Shades Wrathchild).
