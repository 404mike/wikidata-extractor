The relatively undeveloped computing capabilities and solid state measurement capabilities made it almost impossible to be able to get accurate measurements.  Early scientists such as John Monteith used the \"flux gradient\" method to make semi-accurate assessments of the fluxes in a variety of natural settings.  The work of scientists such as Monteith realized that the Flux Gradient method was not nearly as accurate as it needed to be when used to measure trace gas exchange in tall forests.  Eventually, they realized that the downfall of their models was caused by \"large scale transport in the roughness sublayer\". The reason for these data inaccuracies was hypothesized to arise from Monin-Obukhov scaling theory."]}, {"page": "Penman\u2013Monteith equation", "response": ["Like the Penman equation, the Penman\u2013Monteith equation (after Howard Penman and John Monteith) approximates net evapotranspiration (ET), requiring as input daily mean temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation.
