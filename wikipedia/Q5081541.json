The road from Dimapur to Imphal climbs to its northern end and runs along its eastern face. In 1944, Kohima was the administrative centre of Nagaland. The Deputy Commissioner was Charles Pawsey. His bungalow stood on the hillside at a bend in the road, with its gardens and tennis court, and a clubhouse, on terraces above. Although some terraces around the village were cleared for cultivation, the steep slopes of the ridge were densely forested."]}, {"page": "Battle of the Tennis Court", "response": ["Kohima Ridge was about a mile long and about 400 yards wide, with a series of hills and gullies that ran alongside the road from Imphal to Dimapur.  The steep slopes along the road made the ridge a formidable target for attackers, but it was a narrow space from which to repel an enemy attacking in strength. In March 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-Go, a large-scale invasion of India. By April 6 the British, Nepalese and Indian soldiers of Kohima Garrison had been surrounded on the Kohima ridge. As the siege began the Kohima Ridge was defended to the south (facing Imphal) by the 1st Assam Regiment on Jail Hill.  The centre ground of the ridge was mainly defended by 4th Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment.  The North West of the Ridge, known as Hospital Spur, was defended by the 3rd Assam Rifles who were facing the road to Dimapur. The North East of the Ridge on a sharp corner in the road was where the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Charles Pawsey's Bungalow and Tennis Court was situated.  This was initially guarded by a composite group of soldiers, thought to be British and Gurkha troops from the local Reinforcement Depot."]}, {"page": "Pawsey", "response": ["* Charles Pawsey (1894\u20131972), colonial administrator", "* Charles Pawsey (rugby league) (born 1923), rugby player"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2012", "response": ["*Charles Pawsey, 88, English rugby league player."]}, {"page": "Charles Ridley Pawsey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Pawsey"]}, {"page": "Pawsey, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Pawsey"]}]}}
