However, in August 1930 the Marksmen toured Central Europe, playing six games in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary. The squad included, among others, Bill Harper, Alex McNab, Jerry Best and Werner Nilsen as well as veterans James White, Charlie McGill and Bill McPherson and guest player Archie Stark. Both Billy Gonsalves and Bert Patenaude were playing with the United States at the 1930 FIFA World Cup and did not travel. They opened the tour on August 20 with a 2\u20132 tie against  Slavia Prague in front of  a crowd of 18,000. This was the first of two games against Slavia. They lost the other 4\u20130 on August 28. They also played  FK Austria Wien twice, losing the first game 6\u20130 on August 23 before winning the second 3\u20131 the following day.  On August 30 they won their second game when they put three goals past \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. The tour came to an end on August 31 when they lost 6\u20132 to Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC.  The tour ended early, and in dispute, with Fall River unhappy about their share of the gate receipts."]}, {"page": "Best (surname)", "response": ["* Jerry Best (footballer, born 1901) (1901\u20131975), English footballer", "* Jerry Best (bassist) (born 1963), American musician", "* Jerry Best (footballer, born 1897) (1897\u20131955), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of American and Canadian soccer champions", "response": ["|Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "1930 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "American Soccer League (1921\u20131933)", "response": ["|Jerry Best"]}, {"page": "List of Darlington F.C. players", "response": ["Of the more than 150 men who made 100 or more appearances in nationally organised league competition for Darlington, Alan Walsh and Jerry Best are first and second in the club's all-time scorers list.

He played local football for Hamsteels before signing for Darlington of the Football League Third Division North in 1931. He played and scored for the reserve team in the North-Eastern League, and on 23 January 1932, he made his first-team debut and scored in a 6\u20133 win against local rivals Hartlepools United in which \"Wellock, Grieve and Coates shot at every conceivable opportunity, on the half turn, the volley, the half-volley, and on occasions when their backs were turned to the goal\". He scored again in the next match, a 3\u20131 win against Rochdale, and retained a place in the forward line, mainly at inside left for the rest of the season. He played in the first five matches of 1932\u201333, four defeats and a draw, and then was out of the side until December, when he became the seventh player to occupy the outside-left position, and the first to settle in it. He finished the season with five goals from 28 league matches as Darlington finished bottom of the table. Coates was one of just five players on Darlington's retained list, published in May 1933 before their application for re-election was considered. The club were duly re-elected, and appointed a new manager, George Collins, who brought in forwards of his own choosing, including John Middleton, Jerry Bestwho became one of the club's all-time top scorersand Dave Edgar, who took over the outside-left position. Coates appeared just twice, and was given a free transfer at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Joe West (footballer)", "response": ["West joined North Eastern League club Walker Celtic, scored four goals against North Shields on his debut, and two days later moved back into the Football League with Darlington. In January 1935, he scored 10 goals for Darlington Reserves as they beat West Stanley 12\u20132 in the North Eastern League, and was the top scorer for the reserve side, but could not dislodge the prolific Jerry Best from the first team. He played only twice in the Third Division North, when Best was unavailable, and scored once: Darlington's fourth goal in a 4\u20131 defeat of Lincoln City in March. By November, he was back with Walker Celtic."]}, {"page": "Dave Edgar (footballer)", "response": ["He was ever-present in all competitions in 1934\u201335, and scored 13 league goals as Darlington finished fifth in the table. The first of the 13 secured a draw against Doncaster Rovers and the second a week later was the only goal of the local derby away to Hartlepools United, which the Yorkshire Post thought \"fluky\": the goalkeeper placed himself to cover Jerry Best's shot, \"but the ball cannoned off a defender to Edgar, who had only to touch the ball through an untenanted goal.\" He had a run of eight goals in nine matches in December and January, and his 86th-minute winner against Carlisle United in the last match of the season ensured Darlington finished in fifth place, ahead of Tranmere Rovers on goal average. Edgar continued in the side for the first eight matches of the 1935\u201336 season, but when the arrival of Gordon Reed displaced Best from the centre-forward position, new manager George Brown moved Best to outside left and Edgar appeared only twice more for the first team. He finished his Darlington career with 22 goals from 97 matches in senior competition, and was given a free transfer.", "After retiring from League football, Edgar saw off competition from former players including Alf Common and Dickie Downs for the post of coach to County Durham secondary schools under the auspices of a scheme promoted by the Football Association. The Sunderland Echo reported that some of the other candidates dropped out of consideration because of their interpretations of the laws of the game, a topic in which Edgar had excelled. He combined his new role with playing North-Eastern League football for Workington; he helped that club win the North-Eastern League Cup in 1937. Although the Courier reported in the 1937 close season that Edgar \"would not be averse to a return\" to Scottish football, he and former Darlington teammate Jerry Best were at Hexham, also of the North-Eastern League, in 1938."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Loughlin", "response": ["He started the season in the first team, and scored four goals in the first few weeks, but the arrival of centre-forward Jerry Best restricted Loughlin to the role of reserve.
