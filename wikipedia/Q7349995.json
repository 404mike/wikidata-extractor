Tuck joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1935 and first engaged in combat during the Battle of France, over Dunkirk, claiming his first victories. In September 1940 he was promoted to squadron leader and commanded a Hawker Hurricane squadron. In 1941\u20131942, Tuck participated in fighter sweeps over northern France. On 28 January 1942, he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, was forced to land in France, and was taken prisoner. At the time of his capture, Tuck had claimed 29 enemy aircraft destroyed, two shared destroyed, six probably destroyed, six damaged and one shared damaged.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Catford", "response": ["*Robert Stanford Tuck, Second World War fighter ace."]}, {"page": "Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Wing Commander Robert Stanford Tuck, Royal Air Force flying ace who was awarded the DFC three times"]}, {"page": "Battle of Britain (film)", "response": ["The Battle of Britain has a large all-star international cast.

Galland also threatened to withdraw at a planned sequence involving him giving a Nazi salute to G\u00f6ring.

During this time, Dundas and other pilots also expressed dissatisfaction with the formation tactics being used in the wing. After a long conversation into the early hours, Bader accepted the suggestions by his senior pilots and agreed to the use of more flexible tactics to lessen the chances of being taken by surprise.
