Under his own name, he wrote extensively about early English actors and about British literary figures. He also wrote fiction under the collaborative pseudonyms Francis Beeding, Christopher Haddon, David Pilgrim and John Somers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spellbound (1945 film)", "response": ["Spellbound is a 1945 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, and Michael Chekhov. It follows a psychoanalyst who falls in love with the new head of the Vermont hospital in which she works, only to find that he is an imposter suffering dissociative amnesia, and potentially, a murderer. The film is based on the 1927 novel The House of Dr. Edwardes by Hilary Saint George Saunders and John Palmer.", "Spellbound was made over contract disagreements between Alfred Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Hitchcock's contract with Selznick began in March 1939, but only resulted in three films: Spellbound, Rebecca (1940) and The Paradine Case (1947). (Notorious was sold to RKO in mid-production.) Selznick had wanted Hitchcock to make a film based upon Selznick's own positive experience with psychoanalysis; Selznick, at Hitchcock's suggestion, purchased the rights to the 1927 novel The House of Dr. Edwardes by Hilary St. George Saunders and John Palmer (who had co-written it under the pseudonym Francis Beeding), for approximately $40,000."]}, {"page": "Robert Armin", "response": ["Armin is generally credited with all the \"licensed fools\" in the repertory of the Chamberlain's and King's Men: Touchstone in As You Like It, Feste in Twelfth Night, the Fool in King Lear, Lavatch in All's Well That Ends Well, and perhaps Thersites in Troilus and Cressida, the Porter in Macbeth, the Fool in Timon of Athens, and Autolycus in The Winter's Tale.  Of these eight, Touchstone is the fool about which there is the most critical discussion. Harold Bloom describes him as \"rancidly vicious,\" and writes that \"this more intense rancidity works as a touchstone should, to prove the true gold of Rosalind's spirit\". John Palmer disagrees and writes that \"he must be either a true cynic or one that affects his cynicism to mask a fundamentally genial spirit\". Obviously, as Palmer continues, a true cynic does not belong in Arden, so the clown \"must be a thoroughly good fellow at heart\". Touchstone affects the front of a malcontented cynic, thus serving as proof of Rosalind's quick wit. When she confronts both Jaques and Touchstone, she exposes their silliness and prevents the fools from making Arden out to be worse than it really is."]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Napoleon", "response": ["*So Great A Man (1937) by \"David Pilgrim\" (a pseudonym for John Palmer and Hilary Saint George Saunders) depicts Napoleon's life in the years 1808-1809."]}, {"page": "John Palmer", "response": ["John Palmer may refer to:", "*John Palmer (fl. 1377\u20131394), English politician", "*Sir John Palmer, 5th Baronet (1735\u20131817), British politician", "*John Palmer (1785\u20131840), U.S. Congressman from New York", "*John Palmer (politician) (1842\u20131905), former secretary of state of New York and commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic", "*John Palmer (architect) (1785\u20131846), English architect", "*John Palmer (Bath architect) (1738\u20131817), English architect", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1729?\u20131790), English minister, active in the Midlands and north", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1742\u20131786), English minister, active in the south", "*John Palmer (Master of Magdalene College) (died 1607), English clergyman and academic", "*John Palmer (Archdeacon of Southern Melanesia) (1837\u20131902)", "*John Palmer (cricketer) (1881\u20131928), English cricketer", "*John Palmer (musician) (born 1943), English musician", "*John Palmer (composer) (born 1959), composer of instrumental and electronic music", "*John Palmer, alias of highwayman Dick Turpin (1705\u20131739)", "*John Palmer (criminal) (1950\u20132015), convicted time-share fraudster, nicknamed \"Goldfinger\"", "*John Palmer, 4th Earl of Selborne (1940\u20132021), British peer and businessman", "*John Palmer (actor) (1742?\u20131798), English actor", "*John Palmer (author) (1885\u20131944), English author", "*John Palmer (Commissary of New South Wales) (1760\u20131833)", "*John Palmer (director) (1943\u20132020), Canadian film and theatre director", "*John Palmer (postal innovator) (1742\u20131818), inventor of the lightweight mail coach", "*John Palmer (colonial administrator) (c. 1650 \u2013 c. 1700), first Englishman to purchase land in the Rockaway Peninsula", "*John Palmer (TV journalist) (1935\u20132013), former NBC News correspondent", "*John Palmer (Home and Away), fictional character", "*John Palmer (1807 ship)", "*John Palmer (1810 ship)", "*John Palmer (1814 schooner), a ship wrecked in Bass Strait in 1818"]}, {"page": "The House of Dr. Edwardes", "response": ["The House of Dr. Edwardes is a psychological thriller novel written by John Palmer and Hilary A.
