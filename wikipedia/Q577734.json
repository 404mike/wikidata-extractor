He also wrote fiction under the collaborative pseudonyms Francis Beeding, Christopher Haddon, David Pilgrim and John Somers.As \"Francis Beeding\", he and Hilary Saint George Saunders co-authored The House of Dr. Edwardes. The novel was later used as the basis for the Hitchcock film Spellbound.\nThe Beeding pseudonym was kept secret from its start in 1920,  until in 1925 Saunders delivered a lecture about his writing methods, as Francis Beeding, while Palmer heckled from the audience.  Saunders invited Palmer to the platform, and the dual authorship was revealed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
