David Uwins (c. 1780-1837), physician and medical writer, was his elder brother. Thomas showed talent as an artist from an early age, and had some instruction from the drawing-master at his sister's school. He was a day scholar at Mr. Crole's school in Queen's Head Lane, Islington, for 6 years, and in 1797, at the age of 15, was apprenticed to the engraver Benjamin Smith (d. 1833). While with Smith he engraved part of a plate for John Boydell's editions of 'Shakespeare' but had an attack of jaundice, said to have been caused by overwork and dislike of the drudgery of engraving, and left without completing the apprenticeship."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* Dr. David Uwins (c. 1780\u20131837)"]}, {"page": "List of people named David", "response": ["*David Uwins (1780\u20131837), English physician and medical writer  "]}, {"page": "Uwins, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Uwins"]}]}}
