The world's first cotton mill was built in the town of Royton, and the county encompasses several former mill towns. An Association for Industrial Archaeology publication describes Greater Manchester as \"one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, the result of a combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship\". Much of the county was at the forefront of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and into the early-20th century; Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, chair of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said \"clearly, all of the Greater Manchester area was once at the heart of a very vibrant [textiles] industry\", represented by former textile mills found throughout the county. The territory that makes up Greater Manchester experienced a rapid decline of these traditional sectors, partly during the Lancashire Cotton famine brought on by the American Civil War, but mainly as part of the post-war economic depression and deindustrialization of Britain that occurred during the 20th century."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, former Executive Leader of Wigan Council"]}, {"page": "Peter Smith", "response": ["*Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh (1945\u20132021), leader of Wigan council and member of the House of Lords"]}, {"page": "Lord Smith of Leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh"]}, {"page": "Baron Smith of Leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh"]}, {"page": "Lord Smith", "response": ["*Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, Labour councillor from Wigan, chair of Greater Manchester Combined Authority"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Bolton School", "response": ["* Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh (born 1945), Labour politician and Life Peer"]}, {"page": "Baron Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh (born 1945)"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, politician and life peer, member of the House of Lords (since 1999) (born 1945)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2021", "response": ["*Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, 76, British politician and life peer, member of the House of Lords (since 1999).Lord Smith of Leigh"]}]}}
