Collier initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's last season in the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. Collier oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to the Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. Billy Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager for the next three years, before Collier was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936\u201337 FA Cup. In March 1937, Collier retired from football to go into business with his brother.

Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match at the age of 15 years and 281 days. The 1929\u201330 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and Billy Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931\u201332, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of \u00a31,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2\u20132 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932\u201333, finishing in 20th place.

The club finished in 15th place in 1934\u201335, and Bootham Crescent staged its first match against First Division opposition when Derby County defeated York 1\u20130 in the FA Cup third round. In 1935\u201336, York ranked in 16th place, and by the end of the season the club's debt was \u00a37,048. The annual report stated that \"increased support must be forthcoming if the club was to retain its Football League status\". The team reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time in 1936\u201337, being eliminated by Second Division team Swansea Town in a replay. Collier retired from football in March 1937 to go into business with his brother, and was replaced by Tom Mitchell. The team finished an inconsistent season in 12th place. The 1937\u201338 season saw York placed \"firmly on the football map\", as the team eliminated First Division teams West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough from the FA Cup, before meeting Huddersfield Town in the sixth round. This match saw York draw 0\u20130 at home before a crowd of 28,123, the club's record highest attendance. York lost the replay 2\u20131 at Leeds Road, a match that attracted 58,066 spectators. By the end of that season's FA Cup run, York were on the fringe of the promotion race, but faltered in the closing weeks and finished in 11th place.
