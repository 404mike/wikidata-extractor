The Carr family, which owned the title, was incensed at the thought of a Czechoslovak immigrant with socialist politics gaining ownership, and the board voted against Maxwell's bid without any dissent. The News of the Worlds editor, Stafford Somerfield, opposed Maxwell's bid in an October 1968 front page opinion piece, in which he referred to Maxwell's Czechoslovak origins and used his birth name. He wrote, \"This is a British paper, run by British people ... as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding ... Let us keep it that way\". The paper was later purchased by Australian tycoon Rupert Murdoch, who later that year acquired The Sun, which had also previously interested Maxwell."]}, {"page": "Somerfield (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Stafford Somerfield (1911\u20131995), British newspaper editor"]}, {"page": "Norah Wilmot", "response": ["Wilmot was a contemporary and friend of the feminist and fellow trainer Florence Nagle, who had long campaigned against what she saw as an injustice to her sex in British racing. Eventually, frustrated by the Jockey Club's persistent refusal to grant women a training licence, Nagle sought legal redress; initially unsuccessful, her fight finally reached the Court of Appeal in 1966. Using its considerable influence within the Establishment, the club twice had her appeal blocked. Following her third appeal, Nagle emerged from the court victorious. The verdict of the three presiding law lords, Lord Denning, Lord Justice Dankwerts and Lord Salmon, was, in the words of Lord Denning, that \"If she is to carry on her trade without stooping to subterfuge she has to have a training licence.\" Of the Jockey Club itself, the Law Lords went on to pronounce that \"The rights of a person to work should not be prevented by the dictatorial powers of a body which holds a monopoly.\" Faced with the court's damning and embarrassing decision, the Jockey Club was forced to capitulate, and on 3 August 1966 Nagle and Wilmot became the first women in Britain to receive licences to train racehorses. According to Ferelith Somerfield, wife of Stafford Somerfield and author of Nagle's biography, it was the way the Jockey Club dealt with Wilmot that \"proved the catalyst\" to the case being undertaken."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 1995", "response": ["*Stafford Somerfield, 84, British newspaper editor.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 1, ed.
