Example of his Carlist poetry in Basque is Baldespi\u00f1a-Co Marques Chit Gueidiatia Jaunari Oroitza Bat (1891), poems dedicated to the Gipuzkoan Carlist leader marques de Valdespina. Otegui fathered also stories and other short pieces in Basque Three Carlist poets somewhat popular at the time were Pilar de Cavia,Alberto Culebras Mayordomo, Rescatada la obra po\u00e9tica de la hermana de Mariano de Cavia, [in:] ABC 25.06.21, available here Enrique de Olea, and Florentino Soria L\u00f3pez;who published under the pen-name \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez Egusquiza\" especially Soria was rather unambiguous in his political sympathies, on display in the Cantos a la Tradici\u00f3n volume (1911).Dios.

It was performed in Jaimista circulos, see Diario de Valencia 27.01.15, available here. Juan Ortea Fernandez fathered a one-act comedy Requet\u00e9 (1912).Ortea was a longtime editor of Gij\u00f3n Traditionalist periodicals.

Some apparent sympathy for the Carlists, traceable in the text, was made plain in Hobbes' one-act drama Repentance (first staged in London in 1899); one of its protagonists, count Des Escas, declares loyalty to Don Carlos though he knows he would be shot by his captors, Mildred Davis Harding, Air-bird in the Water: The Life and Works of Pearl Craigie (John Oliver Hobbes), Madison 1996, , pp. 223-229 and four Britons, who fathered fast-paced adventurous novels: Henry Seton Merriman,his In Kedar's Tents (1897), set during the First Carlist War, contained some historiosophic comparisons between the Chartists and the Carlists, John Sutherland, The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction, Stanford 1990, , p. 561. The protagonist, an Irish lawyer Frederick Conyngham, flees Britain fearing charges related to Chartist riots; in Spain he inadvertently becomes immersed in political intrigue masterminded by an evasive anti-hero, a Carlist ringleader Esteban Larralde Arthur W. Marchmont,a second-rate but fairly popular novelist, Marchmont (1852-1923) authored Sarita, the Carlist (1902). The protagonist, an impoverished English nobleman Lord Glisfoyle, in diplomatic British service in Spain, gets involved in Carlist conspiracy, co-ran by his Spanish attractive female cousin, Sarita Castelar. The action is apparently set in the 1890s, as the narrative contains vague references to a \"Cuban crisis\". Eventually, Glisfoyle realizes he was being manipulated and acknowledges authority of the Madrid king; in love, he and Sarita leave Spain G. A. Henty,With the British Legion: A Story of the Carlist Wars (1903), also set in the 1830s, is currently classified as fairly typical \"children's fiction\" of the era. Henty was a vastly popular author of numerous adventurous novels intended mostly for juvenile readers. His typical protagonist was a clean-cut if somewhat unruly boy who matures throughout a series of adventures; in With the British Legion he appears as Arthur Hallett, who volunteers to the British unit fighting the Carlists, John Cooper, Children's Fiction 1900\u20131950, London 2019, , pp. 72-73 and Heber Daniels.\"Heber K. Daniels\" was a pen-name of Farquhar E. B. Palliser; his Dona Rufina (1900), marketed as \"interesting story of intrigue and love\", is set in 1898 against a background of Carlist conspiracy, unfolding in England; the romance was issued at least twice, Susan Jones, A Girl of the North, London 1900, p. 177, see here A history of its own is a very short story Ego te absolvo (1905), by some attributed to Oscar Wilde.authenticity of Ego te absolvo is disputed. The story was first published in a volume issued in Paris in 1905; it contained French translations of Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories collection, but also a number of previously unknown stories, also in French. Ego te absolvo was among them, reportedly a translation from an earlier publication in an unidentified US magazine. It was soon claimed that the story was among those \"fraudulently attributed to Oscar Wilde, generally by unscrupulous publishers\"; this was e.g. the opinion of Robert Harborough Sherard, The life of Oscar Wilde, London 1906, p. 460. Since then Ego te absolvo is generally ignored in the English-language publications, compare e.g. the University College Cork collection available here, and generally attributed to Wilde in the Spanish-language ones, compare e.g. Cuentos de Oscar Wilde, Santiago de Chile 2005, , or the online Biblioteca Virtual de Miguel de Cervantes, available here. The story was also included in a volume Tres cuentos carlistas, published by Museum of Carlism, Estella 2010,  Authentic or not, it demonstrates that the prevailing Spanish image of a Carlist crossed the Pyrenees: a Carlist was brutal, wild, and loose about his religious principles;the story is set during the Third Carlist War; two Carlists argue about an unknown woman, treated as a war booty, and both die during the altercation however, there were also opposite stereotypes held.not exactly literature is La Navarraise, an opera by Jules Massenet (1894); it was set in the Third Carlist War and seemed quite sympathetic towards the Carlists, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Between repulsion and attraction: Carlism seen through foreign eyes, [in:] Revista internacional de los estudios vascos 2 (2008), p. 128. Carlism at least 3 times features in writings of the Nobel-prize winner Sienkiewicz. In a grotesque story Szkice w\u0119glem (1877) an exalted and pretentious protagonist in the Polish middle-of-nowhere gets his anti-religious outlook reinforced by lecture of a novel on the First Carlist War. Another story Latarnik (1881) sets as a protagonist a 70-year-old Pole, who apperently took part in the First Carlist War (probably in liberal ranks). In a novel Bez dogmatu (1891)  the key protagonist, an aristocratic Polish dandy raised in Italy and France, during his youth in the 1870 volunteered to Carlist troops  In France, Comte de Saint-Aulaire released a conventional historical novel Carlistes et Christinos (1895).the second edition went to print in 1895; the year of the first edition is not clear, del Burgo 1978, p. 888 In Italy Giovanni Martini, the representative of literary cattolicesimo intransigente, wrote a drama Don Pedro di Elisonda (1900).Giovanni Martini (1876-1905) set his drama in the First Carlist War. The title Carlist protagonist represents moral principles against vile and treacherous enemies; among dramatis personae there is also a servant from Africa, unique literary case of a black Carlist, Angelo d'Ambra, Don Pedro di Elisonda, il dramma storico carlista di un scrittore vicentino, [in:] Historia Regni service 25.08.21, available here"]}, {"page": "Pearl Mary-Teresa Craigie", "response": ["#redirect John Oliver Hobbes"]}]}}
