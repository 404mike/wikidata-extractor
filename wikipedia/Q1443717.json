Born into an Irish Republican family, he was interned during his youth for Irish Republican Army activities; while he later opposed violence, he remained close to the Republican movement. He was running Frank's Bar, a public house in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, when in October 1974 he was elected as a unity candidate to represent Fermanagh and South Tyrone. While not an abstentionist, Maguire's attendances at Westminster were infrequent and he never made a full speech, but he did cast some crucial votes to support the Labour government of the 1970s. He is famous for \"abstaining in person\" in the no confidence vote which brought down the Callaghan government by a single vote.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Frank Maguire"]}, {"page": "Richard Taylor (British politician)", "response": ["Taylor was re-elected at the 2005 election with a reduced majority of 5,250.
