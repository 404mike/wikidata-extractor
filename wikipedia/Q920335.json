He was a pro-EU Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire and the Humber constituency from 1984 until 2014. He was the last and longest-serving UK Vice-President of the European Parliament 2004-2014 with the Human Rights and Democracy portfolio. In 1992 he founded the EU's Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy, which has an annual budget of \u20ac1.5 billion and remain's the world's largest dedicated programme. He was leader of then 36 Conservative MEPs 1997-2001. He contested David Cameron's withdrawal from the majority centrist  European People's Party (EPP) group after the 2009 Euro-elections and refused to sit with its nationalist successor, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group. He then sat as an Independent and Liberal Democrat until 2014. In the 2014 election he lost his seat as an MEP. \nMcMillan-Scott was elected Patron of the non-party European Movement UK, a pro-EU membership organisation founded by Winston Churchill, at its London AGM in 2014. Since 2017 he has coordinated a forum of operational pro-European organisations known as Where Next for Brexit?. This was the stakeholder forum for the Grassroots Coordinating Group set up by former MPs Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry to argue for a second referendum on Brexit and is now closely linked to the European Movement. McMillan-Scott and colleagues raised over \u00a32 million for the People's Vote campaign, launched in April 2018 to campaign publicly for a second referendum. \nBackground McMillan-Scott is a lifelong pro-European. Following David Cameron's decision to withdraw the Conservative MEPs from the centrist European People's Party in order to form the European Conservative and Reformist's Group, McMillan-Scott objected. When the composition of Cameron's new ECR group was announced after the European elections of 2009, McMillan-Scott protested. The new group was described by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg as \"a bunch of nutters, homophobes, anti-Semites and climate-change deniers\". In July 2009 McMillan-Scott successfully stood as an independent Vice-President against the nominee of the ECR Group, Polish MEP Micha\u0142 Kami\u0144ski, criticising Kami\u0144ski's alleged past links to extremism, confirmed inter alia by the Daily Telegraph. He is the only Vice-President to have been elected without an official party candidature.\nIn March 2010, he joined the Liberal Democrats with whom he had usually worked closely on democracy and human rights issues.  In May 2010 he became a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the European Parliament. He then sat as ALDE Vice-President of the European Parliament. In January 2012, he was re-elected as vice-president for the fourth time. He once again received the portfolio for Democracy and Human Rights as well as additionally gaining the Sakharov Prize Network, which underpins the parliament's annual prize for freedom of expression and responsibility for transatlantic relations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "EMS", "response": ["* Edward McMillan-Scott (born 1949), British politician and MEP"]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom (1999\u20132004)", "response": ["| Edward McMillan-Scott    "]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament (1994\u20131999)", "response": ["*Edward McMillan-Scott"]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament (1999\u20132004)", "response": ["*Edward McMillan-Scott"]}, {"page": "Timothy Kirkhope", "response": ["In June 2009 Kirkhope helped to set up (with the Rt.
