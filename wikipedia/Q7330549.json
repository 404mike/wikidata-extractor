Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks \"we [Gillies and the club's directors] think your best days are behind you, and you should move on\". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at \u00a350,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for \u00a365,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side."]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["*  Richie Norman 365"]}, {"page": "Burton Albion F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Richie Norman"]}, {"page": "Nuneaton Borough F.C.", "response": ["| Jamie CapesKevin WilldenRichie Norman"]}, {"page": "1961 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||3 || Richie Norman"]}, {"page": "1965 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|FB ||3 || Richie Norman", "|LB ||3 || Richie Norman"]}, {"page": "1963 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|LB ||3 || Richie Norman"]}, {"page": "1964 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|||8|| Richie Norman"]}, {"page": "Norman (name)", "response": ["*Richie Norman (born 1935), former English footballer"]}, {"page": "1962\u201363 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["In defence, Leicester forged a fearsome half-back line of McLintock, Ian King and club captain Colin Appleton with John Sjoberg and Richie Norman as full-backs and legendary goalkeeper Gordon Banks in goal.", "|Richie Norman", "|align=left| Richie Norman", "|Richie Norman"]}]}}
