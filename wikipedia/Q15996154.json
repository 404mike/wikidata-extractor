He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Joseph is reported to have told his son Arthur that he was \"a dunce at school\" and that the only way that he could succeed in life would be in his father's flour mill. J. Arthur ventured on his own with Peterkins Self-Raising Flour, but when that business failed he returned to work for his father.

John Budgen died in 1765 and the rent was paid by his widow until she died in 1768, when Ezekiel Budgen took the mill. Ezekiel Budgen was involved in a quarrel with his brother Isaac, which led to William Budgen (Ezekiel's nephew) being granted a piece of land near the mill in 1796 with liberty to erect a windmill upon it. By 1806, the mill was in the possession of John Jupp. William Jupp took the mill sometime before 1880 and ran it until he died in 1934. In 1929, the Windmill Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings recognised the mill as \"of paramount importance\". A new pair of Spring sails were needed in 1931. The Society paid for Thomas Hunt, the Soham millwright, to make and fit these at a cost of \u00a380. William Jupp agreed not to sell the mill for demolition as a condition of the work being done. Publicity generated at the time led to an increase in orders at the mill. On 30 October 1931, a meeting was held to appeal for funds to replace the older pair of sails. Hilaire Belloc, who at the time owned Shipley windmill in Sussex, was the main speaker. Sir Joseph Rank was one of the subscribers. In 1933, a pair of sails was purchased secondhand. These had previously been on the Black Mill, Forncett End, Norfolk, which had been demolished in September 1932. These replaced a pair of sails that had been on the mill for in excess of sixty years.

This is understandable as Rank themselves were at one point a highly diversified conglomerate, and were apt to rename acquired or joint venture business by prefixing them with the name \"Rank\", e.g. Rank Xerox. There is a link, but the \"Rank\" reference is to Joseph Rank, father of J. Arthur Rank, who merely inherited the business upon his father's death.
