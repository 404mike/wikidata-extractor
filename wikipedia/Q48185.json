He was the son of the author George du Maurier and brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. During 1902, he married the actress Muriel Beaumont with whom he had three daughters: writers Angela du Maurier (1904\u20132002) and Daphne du Maurier (1907\u20131989), and painter Jeanne du Maurier (1911\u20131997). His popularity was due to his subtle and naturalistic acting: a \"delicately realistic style of acting that sought to suggest rather than to state the deeper emotions\".\nHis Times obituary said of his career: \"His parentage assured him of engagements in the best of company to begin with; but it was his own talent that took advantage of them.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Hitchcock", "response": ["At this time, Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew.

It ended in early 1931, and the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri; he appeared in 12 different productions, putting on 87 shows. He received praise from local newspapers for these performances, gaining a reputation as a romantic leading man. Significant influences on his acting in this period were Gerald du Maurier, A. E. Matthews, Jack Buchanan, and Ronald Squire. He admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a \"great need to be liked and admired\". He was eventually fired by the Shuberts at the end of the summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression. His unemployment was short-lived, however; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his musical Nikki, and Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France. The production opened on September 29, 1931, in New York, but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression."]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["One of Olivier's contemporaries at the school was Peggy Ashcroft, who observed he was \"rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun\". By his own admission, he was not a very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband Lewis Casson as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, \"He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson.\" Olivier's concern with speaking naturally and avoiding what he called \"singing\" Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, as critics regularly decried his delivery."]}, {"page": "Daphne du Maurier", "response": ["Her parents were actor/manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and stage actress Muriel Beaumont.

Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on the premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by Dorothea Baird, the actress playing Mary Darling, but Gerald du Maurier, already playing George Darling (and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead, a casting tradition since replicated in many stage and film productions of the Peter Pan story."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["* Sir Gerald du Maurier (1929-1930)"]}, {"page": "Ralph Richardson", "response": ["Doran's company specialised in the classics, principally Shakespeare.
