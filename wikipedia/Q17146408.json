It is co-operative in the strictest sense. Its members are their own craftsmen, and will produce their books themselves in their own communal workshops without recourse to paid and irresponsible labour\". Their first publications were The Voices, a literary  review, and Adam & Eve & Pinch Me, short stories by a new author, A. E. Coppard, which was a critical success and sold well. Unfortunately the mood of idealism of the first prospectus did not last long. Proof-reading, for example, had been poor, which upset the authors. By summer 1921 Blackburn and Pyper had left and the co-operative became a more conventional private press when Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs were employed. In 1923 the press published The Wedding Songs of Spenser with colour wood engravings by Ethelbert White, the first illustrated book from the press and a foretaste of editions to come."]}, {"page": "Ethelbert white", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ethelbert White "]}, {"page": "Romney's House", "response": ["In 1929 the house was bought by Clough Williams-Ellis for use as his home and as the office for his architectural practice.

Her work was initially influenced by the way the French modernist movement was being interpreted in Britain by artists such as Paul Nash, John Nash, Iain Macnab and Ethelbert White, but as she began to travel, for example, to Paris, and was able to see pictures by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque at first hand, the influence of Modernism deepened. After her visits to Vienna in the early 1920s she produced a small number of woodcuts and wood engravings from 1925, but there were none after 1930."]}]}}
