Weaver also played for the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry Blaze", "response": ["Blaze entered the 2007 season with the majority of the Championship team retained. Captain Ashley Tait departed after a five-year stay and was replaced by fellow British international Jonathan Weaver in the team's big transfer story, while sniper Curtis Huppe arrived from Belfast and past-servants of the club, Russ Cowley and Matt Soderstrom, returned to Coventry for the 2007\u201308 season. Despite relinquishing the Challenge Cup early on with failure to escape their group and make the semis, Blaze started strong in the league and kept going throughout the season. They were the British representatives in the Continental Cup once more, this time in Aalborg, Denmark, and although they ultimately missed out on a place in the next round, they produced one of the greatest results in the club's history \u2013 a 3\u20132 overtime comeback win against Austrian champians Red Bull Salzburg. Domestically, Adam Calder, ably assisted again by partner Dan Carlson, proved to be Blaze's main weapon. The Canadian scorer had a career season, hitting 58 goals and 125 points in Elite League competitions as he ended the year the club's and the league's MVP.", "The season did not start well with four consecutive defeats against Belfast and Nottingham leaving the Blaze at the bottom of the league table, but even a club record 12 game unbeaten run between the end of September and middle of November did not help them catch up with the leaders. From then on Blaze lost more games than they won and the result was 6th in the league standings \u2013 Coventry's worst finish in their 11-year history. Injuries were blamed for the downturn, particularly to key imports, with defenceman Jeff Smith, Brian Lee and Jonathan Weaver all requiring lengthy lay-offs which resulted in Blaze calling up inexperienced players from their ENL team as well as bringing back Jason Robinson from retirement in America to help plug the gaps on the blueline. The situation was just as bad in attack with goalscorer Owen Fussey sidelined after 34 games with a knee injury and Brad Cruikshank forced to serve a lengthy ban for his involvement in a bench clearance against rivals Nottingham in a game at the SkyDome.", "* 2007\u201308 Trevor Koenig, Neal Martin, Jonathan Weaver, Adam Calder", "* 2009\u201310 Luke Fulghum, Jonathan Weaver", "* 2008\u201309 Jonathan Weaver, Adam Calder"]}, {"page": "Newcastle Vipers", "response": ["** 2005\u201306 Jonathan Weaver", "** 2006\u201307 Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "Telford Tigers", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 EIHL season", "response": ["*Alan Weeks Trophy \u2013 Jonathan Weaver, Newcastle Vipers", "| Jonathan Weaver, Newcastle Vipers"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 EIHL season", "response": ["*Alan Weeks Trophy \u2013 Jonathan Weaver, Newcastle Vipers", "| Jonathan Weaver, Newcastle Vipers"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 EIHL season", "response": ["|  Jonathan Weaver || Newcastle Vipers || Coventry Blaze || May 9"]}, {"page": "Alan Weeks Trophy", "response": ["| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "EIHL All-Star Team", "response": ["| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver", "| Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "Ice Hockey Annual Trophy", "response": ["| Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 ISL season", "response": ["*Ice Hockey Annual Trophy \u2013 Jonathan Weaver, Ayr Scottish Eagles"]}, {"page": "Man of Ice Awards", "response": ["*Best British Player: Jonathan Weaver from Coventry Blaze", "*Defenceman of the Year: Jonathan Weaver from Coventry Blaze"]}, {"page": "2009 IIHF World Championship Division I rosters", "response": ["|Jonathan Weaver"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Coventry Blaze season", "response": ["| align=left| Jonathan Weaver (C)", "| align=left| Jonathan Weaver || 50 || 8 || 40 || 48 || 5 ||  ||  || 32"]}, {"page": "2011 IIHF World Championship Division I", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jonathan Weaver || 5 || 1 || 7 || 8 || +1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Coventry Blaze season", "response": ["| align=left| Jonathan Weaver (C)", "| align=left| Jonathan Weaver || 64 || 8 || 36 || 44 || 4 || 0 || 3 || 36"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 EIHL season", "response": ["| Coventry Blaze || SkyDome Arena || Sally Mahers  || 2003 || Paul Thompson || Jonathan Weaver|| Dustin Wood || Bryan Jurynec"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Weaver", "response": ["Jonathan Weaver may refer to:", "*Jonathan Weaver (ice hockey) (born 1977), British professional ice hockey defenceman", "*Jonathan Weaver (bishop) (1824\u20131901), bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Coventry Blaze season", "response": ["| align=left|  Jonathan Weaver"]}]}}
