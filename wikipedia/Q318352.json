He was one of the first people to take photographs in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events like the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He influenced other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corfu", "response": ["Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called Corfiot Italians, and until the second half of the 20th century the Veneto da mar was spoken in Corfu.

Consequently, it was long assumed that such photographs were the work of one photographer who somehow managed to photograph at the same time in places as distant as Egypt and Japan. It was only in 1983 that the truth of the matter was revealed, in a paper by Italo Zannier.Zannier, Italo. Verso oriente: Fotografie di Antonio e Felice Beato, Florence: Alinari, 1986. The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image. Both signatures may refer to either or both photographers.", "From time to time, the brothers split up and joined with other pioneering photographers for specific projects. In 1855, one of the brothers, Felix, teamed up with the pair's brother-in-law, James Robertson and travelled to the Crimea where they assumed responsibility for war photography.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 128; Greenough, p. 21; Pare, \"Roger Fenton\", p. 226. and made their reputation by depicting the destruction and death associated with the conflict.
