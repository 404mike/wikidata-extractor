The emphasis for this type of development is to focus on pedestrians over cars and other forms of community interaction. Fairford Leys is one of the first examples of a development planned using a Design Code, championed by John Prescott and the Labour government of the late 1990s. The aim of the code was to create an urban village development and it sets out design rules during, and also after, the construction phase, to ensure the individual developers all build to the same design details and to create cohesion to the appearance of the development as a whole. The driving force behind this was the original landowner, the Ernest Cook Trust. The architecture is inspired by traditional Aylesbury housing styles and pastiche Victorian lamp posts and railings. The centre of the estate is surrounded by the \"city wall\", a concept originating from the masterplanner John Simpson and inspired by medieval city walls, such as York.
