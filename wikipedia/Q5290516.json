The Rebels had recruited strongly in the off season with Welsh international Dominic Day, Japanese international Amanaki Mafi and NRL star Marika Koroibete joining along with a selection of young talent including another young Victorian talent Jordan Uelese, who would win his first Australian cap at the end of the season. Kiwi fly-half Jackson Garden-Bachop would become the 100th player to represent the Rebels, while the only remaining foundation player, Laurie Weeks, became the most capped player. The Rebels only won once across the season, a 19\u201317 victory against the Brumbies, while there was also a 9\u20139 draw against the Sharks in Durban as the Rebels finished 18th and bottom of the Super Rugby ladder. The threat of the axe from Super Rugby continued to hang over the Rebels well into the off season when it was announced that the Western Force would be axed and the Rebels saved, with CEO Andrew Cox transferring his shares back to the Victorian Rugby Union to secure the future of the Rebels. At the end of the season coach Tony McGahan departed the club the become the Reds' assistant coach."]}, {"page": "Cardiff Metropolitan University RFC", "response": ["*  Dominic Day"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Llanelli Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LK||align=\"left\"| Dominic Day"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LK||align=\"left\"| Dominic Day"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LK||align=\"left\"| Dominic Day"]}, {"page": "Day (surname)", "response": ["* Dominic Day, Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LK||align=\"left\"| Dominic Day"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LK||align=\"left\"| Dominic Day"]}]}}
