The speech opposed the position espoused by Corbyn against the government's motion. The speech was applauded by some MPs on both sides of the house, a gesture not usually permitted in the Commons. Along with a minority of shadow cabinet colleagues, he voted for airstrikes in Syria and the motion passed by a higher-than-expected majority of 174 votes. The Conservative Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described Benn's oration as \"one of the truly great speeches in Commons history\". Speaking to the BBC the following day, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell compared Benn's speech to that given by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 ahead of the Iraq War. McDonnell described it as an \"excellent\" piece of oratory, but added: \"The greatest oratory can lead us to the greatest mistakes.\" According to Labour MP Jamie Reed, following his speech, in the eyes of Corbyn, Benn became \"at best a rebel, at worst a traitor.\""]}, {"page": "Jedi census phenomenon", "response": ["In June 2005, Jamie Reed, newly elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Copeland in Cumbria, declared himself to be the first Jedi Member of Parliament during his maiden speech.

During a subsequent committee debate on the bill, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Beaconsfield, Dominic Grieve, proposed as \"a bit of a joke\" to exclude Jedi Knights from the protection of the proposed act, along with Satanists and proponents of animal sacrifice, illustrating the difficulty of defining religious belief in legislation.
