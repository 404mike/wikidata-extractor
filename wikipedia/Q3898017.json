Liberalism and the Economic Order. Cambridge University Press. p. 115. In Anarchy, State, and Utopia, Nozick argues that an anarcho-capitalist society would inevitably transform into a minarchist state through the eventual emergence of a monopolistic private defense and judicial agency that no longer faces competition. He argues that anarcho-capitalism results in an unstable system that would not endure in the real world. While anarcho-capitalists such as Roy Childs and Murray Rothbard have rejected Nozick's arguments,See Childs's incomplete essay, \"Anarchist Illusions\", Liberty against Power: Essays by Roy A.

Paul Birch argues that legal disputes involving several jurisdictions and different legal systems will be too complex and costly, therefore the largest private protection business in a territory will develop into a natural monopoly. Robert Ellickson presented a Hayekian case against anarcho-capitalism, calling it a \"pipe-dream\" and stating that anarcho-capitalists \"by imagining a stable system of competing private associations, ignore both the inevitability of territorial monopolists in governance, and the importance of institutions to constrain those monopolists' abuses\"."]}, {"page": "Dyson sphere", "response": ["If assuming a radius of 1\u00a0AU, then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star's gravity. Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome 1\u00a0AU in height under the Sun's gravity at that distance. Indeed, it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes, but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another, the net force on that point is immense, but finite. No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure, and form a rigid, static sphere around a star. It has been proposed by Paul Birch (in relation to smaller \"Supra-Jupiter\" constructions around a large planet rather than a star) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a space fountain.Search WaybackMachine for the 14th of June 2011 copy of  Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere, at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity, would press outwards on magnetic bearings due to centrifugal force. For a Dyson shell of 1\u00a0AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun, a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity (297.9\u00a0km/s) would support 99 (a\u00a0=\u00a0v2/r) times its own mass in additional shell structure."]}, {"page": "Anarchism and capitalism", "response": ["Anarchists argue that anarcho-capitalism does not in fact get rid of the state and that it simply privatises it.

By precessing the ring once every 24 hours, the Orbital Ring will hover above any meridian selected on the surface of Earth.  The cables which dangle from the ring are now geostationary without having to reach geostationary altitude or be placed into the equatorial plane.  This means that using the Orbital Ring concept, one or many pairs of Stations can be positioned above any points on Earth desired, or can be moved everywhere on the globe. Thus, any point on Earth can be served by a space elevator. Also, a whole network of orbital rings can be built, which, by crossing over the poles, could cover the whole planet and be capable of taking over most freight and passenger transport. By an array of elevators and several geostationary ring stations, asteroid or Moon material can be received and gently put down where land fills are needed. The electric energy generated in the process would pay for the system expansion and ultimately could pave the way for a solar-system-wide terraforming and astroengineering activity on a sound economical basis.", "Two other types were also defined by Paul Birch:", "In addition, he proposed the concept of \"supramundane worlds\" such as supra-Jovian and supra-stellar \"planets\".

The shade's panels would not be perpendicular to the Sun's rays, but instead at an angle of 30 degrees, such that the reflected light would strike the next panel, negating the photon pressure. Each successive row of panels would be +/- 1 degree off the 30-degree deflection angle, causing the reflected light to be skewed 4 degrees from striking Venus.", "Paul Birch suggests that, in addition to cooling the planet with a sunshade in L1, \"heat pipes\" could be built on the planet to accelerate the cooling. The proposed mechanism would transport heat from the surface to colder regions higher up in the atmosphere, similar to a solar updraft tower, thereby facilitating radiation of excess heat out into space. A newly proposed variation of this technology is the atmospheric vortex engine, where instead of physical chimney pipes, the atmospheric updraft is achieved through the creation of a vortex, similar to a stationary tornado. In addition to this method being less material intensive and potentially more cost effective, this process also produces a net surplus of energy, which could be utilised to power venusian colonies or other aspects of the terraforming effort, while simultaneously contributing to speeding up the cooling of the planet. Another method to cool down the planet could be with the use of radiative cooling This technology could utilise the fact that in certain wavelengths, thermal radiation from the lower atmosphere of Venus can \"escape\" to space through partially transparent atmospheric \u201cwindows\u201d \u2013 spectral gaps between strong CO2 and H2O absorption bands in the near infrared range . The outgoing thermal radiation is wavelength dependent and varies from the very surface at  to approximately  at . Nanophotonics and construction of metamaterials opens up new possibilities to tailor the emittance spectrum of a surface via properly designing periodic nano/micro-structures.", "Paul Birch suggests the possibility of colliding Venus with one of the ice moons from the outer solar system, thereby bringing in all the water needed for terraformation in one go. This could be achieved through gravity assisted capture of Saturn's moons Enceladus and Hyperion or Uranus's moon Miranda. Simply changing the velocity of these moons enough to move them from their current orbit and enable gravity-assisted transport to Venus would require large amounts of energy. However, through complex gravity-assisted chain reactions the propulsion requirements could be reduced by several orders of magnitude. As Birch puts it, \"[t]heoretically one could flick a pebble into the asteroid belt and end up dumping Mars into the Sun.\"", "Paul Birch suggested keeping the entire planet protected from sunlight by a permanent system of slated shades in L1, and the surface illuminated by a rotating soletta mirror in a polar orbit, which would produce a 24-hour light cycle."]}, {"page": "Non-rocket spacelaunch", "response": ["In a series of 1982 articles published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Paul Birch presented the concept of orbital ring systems.
