During the Second World War he commanded the 70th Infantry Division in India, and was deputy commander of the Special Force, commonly known as the Chindits, in Burma. He was deputy commander of the lines of communication of the 21st Army Group from May to November 1944, and then commanded the lines of communication in South East Asia Command (SEAC). In June 1945, he became general officer commanding (GOC) in Southern Burma.\nIn 1949, he retired from the British Army and emigrated to Australia, where he became one of the first directors of Santos from its initial incorporation in Adelaide on 18 March 1954 until he retired in 1978. He was private secretary to two South Australian Governors, Sir Robert George and Sir Edric Bastyan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chindits", "response": ["Slim, the commander of the British Fourteenth Army which had loose operational control over Special Force, selected Brigadier Lentaigne to be Wingate's replacement after conferring with Brigadier Derek Tulloch, Wingate's Chief of Staff. Lentaigne was judged to be the most balanced and experienced commander in the force; he had been an instructor at the Staff College at Quetta, had led a Gurkha battalion with distinction during the gruelling retreat from Burma in 1942 and had commanded a Chindit brigade in the field (albeit for only a few weeks, but none of the other brigade commanders had more experience). As an officer of Gurkha troops, he had a similar outlook and background to Slim. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities, mostly without staff qualifications, some of whom had never even commanded a battalion-sized unit in combat before 1944, and Wingate's staff officers lacked the necessary combat experience.Allen 1984, pp.348\u2013351; summary from . The force's second-in-command, Major General George William Symes, was bypassed by Slim and formally protested and asked to be relieved.Allen 1984, pp. 350\u2013351. In selecting Lentaigne, Slim did not take into account the tensions between those Chindit commanders and staff who were closely associated with Wingate, and Lentaigne, who had a classical \"line\" officer's background and had been critical of Wingate's methods and techniques.Allen 1984, p. 122."]}, {"page": "George Symes", "response": ["*George William Symes (1896\u20131980), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Daniel Cudmore (businessman)", "response": ["::*Kathleen (27 June 1908 \u2013 11 June 2013) married (Richard) Geoffrey Champion de Crespigny (16 June 1907 \u2013 12 February 1966) on 10 June 1933.
