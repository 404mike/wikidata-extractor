He is best known for The Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera: Comprising Their Generic Characters, a Notice of Their Habits and Transformations, and a Catalogue of the Species of Each Genus, co-written with John O. Westwood, and illustrated by William Chapman Hewitson; and List of the Specimens of Lepidopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum.\nDoubleday was born on 9 October 1810 in Epping, Essex, the second son of Benjamin and Mary Doubleday. His older brother was Henry Doubleday who also grew up to become a notable entomologist. They were both interested in natural history and spent their childhood collecting specimens in the nearby Epping Forest. The boys grew up in a Quaker family and Edward received a good classical education at the local Quaker school.In 1835, he joined a fellow Quaker named Robert Foster on a trip to the United States, and while there wrote a series of letters that appeared in the Entomological Magazine in London under the running title of \"Communications on the Natural History of North America\". He spent much time in upstate New York where he and Foster collected numerous insects, including half a dozen stoneflies new to science that Edward Newman, yet another Quaker, described and named in a paper in the Entomological Magazine. Doubleday also collected in other parts of the country including Kentucky where he was struck by the verdant beauty of the landscape. He spent about two years in the United States and amassed a significant collection of insects, much of which he shipped to the British Museum and other scientific institutions in England.Upon his return to England, Doubleday tried for an appointment to the ill-fated Niger expedition of 1841. When he was turned down he accepted a position with the British Museum where he built one of the most comprehensive butterfly collections at that time. He remained at the museum until he died on 14 December 1849. Edward never married, and he was survived by his brother Henry, who was also a bachelor and an outstanding naturalist in his own right. As Robert Mays, author of the book Henry Doubleday: The Epping Naturalist wrote: \"Had Edward lived longer his name would undoubtedly have found a place beside those of the eminent 19th century entomologists\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Doubleday (entomologist)", "response": ["Henry Doubleday was the eldest son of Quaker and grocer Benjamin Doubleday and his wife Mary of Epping, Essex.

Gray resigned in the same year then and was replaced by J. O. Westwood. Under the impulse of this last entomologist, who had many functions, the society made great strides. It was in particular attended regularly by Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) on his return from the voyage on H.M.S. Beagle: he became a member of the council and vice-president in 1838. J. O. Westwood left his functions in 1848 and was replaced by Edward Doubleday (1810\u20131849) and William Frederick Evans. They in their turn were soon replaced. In 1849, a secretary charged to collect the minutes of the meetings was named in the person of John William Douglas (1814\u20131905), a position he kept until 1856. He was assisted in 1851-1852 by Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822\u20131892), in 1853-1854 by William Wing (1827\u20131855), in 1855-1856 by Edwin Shepherd who then replaced J.W. Douglas in his position. Edward Wesley Janson (1822\u201391), a natural history agent, publisher and entomologist was Curator of the Entomological Society collections from 1850\u201363 and librarian from 1863\u201374."]}, {"page": "Edward Newman (entomologist)", "response": ["Newman was born in Hampstead into a Quaker family.

Here he met many of the leading entomologists of the day, including Edward Doubleday, and was a founder member of the Entomological Club. In 1832 he was elected as editor of the club's journal, The Entomological Magazine, and the following year became a fellow of the Linnean Society and one of the founder members of the Entomological Society of London."]}, {"page": "Puriri moth", "response": ["This species was first described in 1843 by Edward Doubleday in the book Travels in New Zealand by Ernst Dieffenbach.

He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them under the tutelage of Edward Doubleday. His solicitor father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a counting house in London, and began acting in amateur theatre. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14\u00a0km) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of Merri Creek, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship Ganges from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the albatross that he encountered for the first time. After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and cataloguing the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens. This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by Frederick McCoy to form the nucleus of the new National Museum of Victoria."]}, {"page": "Rhaphicera satricus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Edward Doubleday"]}, {"page": "Orocrambus flexuosellus", "response": ["Orocrambus flexuosellus is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.
