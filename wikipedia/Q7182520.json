During 1971 and 1972, their musical style followed a marked progression from the Archies-like bubblegum style of \"Funny Funny\" to a Who-influenced hard rock style supplemented by a striking use of high-pitched backing vocals.", "In January 1968 Connolly and Tucker formed a new band calling themselves The Sweetshop. They recruited bass guitarist and vocalist Steve Priest from a local band called The Army. Priest had previously played with mid-'60s band the Countdowns who had been produced and recorded by Joe Meek. Frank Torpey was again recruited to play guitar. The quartet made its public debut at the Pavilion in Hemel Hempstead on 9 March 1968 and soon developed a following on the pub circuit, which led to a contract with Fontana Records. At the time, another UK band released a single under the same name Sweetshop, so the band abbreviated their moniker to Sweet. The band was managed by Paul Nicholas, who later went on to star in Hair. Nicholas worked with record producer Phil Wainman at Mellin Music Publishing and recommended the band to him. Their debut single \"Slow Motion\" (July 1968), produced by Wainman, and released on Fontana, failed to chart and owing to its rarity now sells for several hundred pounds when auctioned. Sweet were released from the recording contract and Frank Torpey left. In his autobiography Are You Ready Steve, Priest said that Gordon Fairminer was approached to play for them when Torpey decided to leave Sweet after a gig at Playhouse Theatre Walton-on-Thames on 5 July 1969 but turned the job down as he wanted to concentrate on other interests.", "Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates.", "Sweet made their UK television debut in December 1970 on a pop show called Lift Off, performing the song \"Funny Funny\". A management deal was signed with the aforementioned songwriting team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. Phil Wainman resumed his collaboration with Sweet, as executive producer. This management deal also included a worldwide record contract with RCA Records, the U.S. excepted: in the United States and Canada Bell Records issued the group's music until late 1973, followed by Capitol Records.", "Sweet's first full LP album, Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be, was released in November 1971. A collection of the band's recent singles supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including \"Chop Chop\" and \"Tom Tom Turnaround\") and pop covers (such as the Lovin' Spoonful's \"Daydream\" and the Supremes' \"Reflections\"), the album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts.", "By 1974, Sweet had grown tired of the management team of Chinn and Chapman, who wrote the group's major hits and cultivated the band's glam rock image. The group and producer Phil Wainman, assisted by engineer Peter Coleman, recorded the album Sweet Fanny Adams, which was released in April 1974. Sweet's technical proficiency was demonstrated for the first time on self-penned hard rock tracks such as \"Sweet F.A.\" and \"Set Me Free\". Sweet also adopted a more conventional hard rock sound and appearance. Sweet Fanny Adams also featured compressed high-pitched backing vocal harmonies, which was a trend that continued on all of Sweet's albums.", "Their third album, Desolation Boulevard, was released later in 1974, six months after Sweet Fanny Adams. By that stage, producer Phil Wainman had moved on and the album was produced by Mike Chapman. It was recorded in a mere six days and featured a rawer \"live\" sound. One track, \"The Man with the Golden Arm\", written by Elmer Bernstein and Sylvia Fine for the 1955 Frank Sinatra movie of the same name, featured drummer Mick Tucker performing an 8 and half minute solo (although this was not included in the U.S. release). This had been a staple of the band's live performance for years. The first single from the LP, the heavy-melodic \"The Six Teens\" (July 1974), was a Top 10 hit in the U.K. and still part of the amazing unbroken string of No. 1's in Denmark. However, the subsequent single release, \"Turn It Down\" (November 1974), reached only No. 41 on the U.K. chart and No. 2 in Denmark. \"Turn It Down\" received minimal airplay on UK radio and was banned by some radio stations because of certain lyrical content - \"God-awful sound\" and \"For God sakes, turn it down\" - which were deemed \"unsuitable for family listening.\" The band resumed playing live shows nearly a full six months after Connolly's throat injury, with band and critics noting a rougher edge to his voice and a reduced range. The album also featured a group composition, \"Fox On The Run\", which was to be re-recorded months later."]}, {"page": "Black Sea (XTC album)", "response": ["Frontman Andy Partridge sensed that he was losing the band's leadership, partly due to Moulding providing all of their charting singles to date and the resultant favouritism attracted from their label Virgin Records.

I felt pressured but Andy was champing at the bit to redress the balance and prove that he could write a chart hit, too.\" To follow \"Nigel\", the band recorded Partridge's \"Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down\" with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame.

At the end of July 1977, the band worked with Wainman at Morgan Studios in Willesden, recording its first single \"Your Generation\". Wainman was not impressed with the musical ability of the band, particularly with Laff's technical proficiency'Idol & James find the new X factor', New Musical Express, 6 December 1980 or with Idol's capacity as a singer, and in response to Idol asking for his opinion during production as to whether he thought Generation X were \"going to make it\", answered with some dubiety.Radio interview with Phil Wainman, 'The Producers' Wnew.Radio.com 13 September 2011 On release at the start of September 1977, \"Your Generation\", with a b-side of the high-energy disaffected punk-rock song \"Day by Day\" (with a title taken by James from the recent publication of Robin Day's autobiography), went to No. 36 in the UK Singles Chart, after being critiqued by Elton John in a review column in the Record Mirror as 'dreadful garbage'.'If that's your generation you can keep it', Record Mirror, 3 September 1977 The band played the song on Marc Bolan's afternoon variety show, Marc, a few days later using Granada Television's Manchester studio instruments for the performance, afterwards making off with the drum-kit and being banned by Granada for 10 years as a result.", "In late September/early October 1977, the band spent several days recording demo sessions, overseen by Phil Wainman, at Utopia Studios in Primrose Hill, North London, in preparation for its first album release.", "In mid-November 1977, the band released the single \"Wild Youth\", written on the spur of the moment during a publicity photo-shoot with the photographer Ray Stevenson, in the streets of London's West End a few weeks earlier, the song being inspired by street graffiti. The single's cover-art comprised individual colourized rotoscoped band portraits, taken by the photographer Peter \"Kodick\" Gravelle. It was produced by Phil Wainman at Utopia Studios, with an experimental b-side track entitled \"Wild Dub\" attempting an early fusion, before the subsequent Two-tone movement, of the ska music of the West and South London Afro-Caribbean immigrant communities with Generation X's punk-pop sound, following on from The Clash's foray into the same area a few months earlier, with their cover of the song \"Police and Thieves\".

Virgin requested Lillywhite to remix \"Real by Reel\", \"When You're Near Me I Have Difficulty\", \"Helicopter\" and \"Outside World\" as potential follow-up singles, but the new mixes were rejected by the group. Instead, the band recorded \"Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down\", a reggae-influenced Partridge song with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame. It was their lowest-selling single to date. They also rerecorded \"Ten Feet Tall\" to have electric guitar in its arrangement. It was released as their first US single to coincide with their first tour there, which lasted from 14 January to 14 March.
