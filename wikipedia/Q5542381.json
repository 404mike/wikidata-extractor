This journey was 19,019 miles (30,608 km) on foot in 2,425 days (1977\u20131983) and is documented in his book The Longest Walk (1988). He received substantial media coverage (including appearances on the Today Show, CBS Morning News and Larry King Live) and was featured in numerous public speaking forums.\nIn the course of his walk and subsequent worldwide residencies, Meegan developed a profound interest in indigenous cultures; he sought innovative ways to teach native peoples how to flourish in modern technological society while retaining their language and identity. In 2014, he wrote Democracy Reaches the Kids, a book about how persons of all cultures may best learn what they truly want to know in life, naturally and joyfully, without centralized government compulsion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dari\u00e9n Gap", "response": ["A number of notable crossings have been made on foot. Sebastian Snow crossed the Gap with Wade Davis in 1975 as part of his unbroken walk from Tierra del Fuego to Costa Rica.

He too started in Tierra del Fuego and eventually ended in Alaska. His 1988 biography, The Longest Walk, describes the trip and includes a 25-page chapter on his foray through the Gap.

On his first trip to Japan in 2002, he fell in love with the country. It was on this trip that a friend nicknamed him \"Kintaro,\" which means \"Golden Boy,\" because of his blond hair. Occasionally accompanying him on the trip was his girlfriend, Ayumi, whose father, George Meegan, completed the longest unbroken walk in recorded history - a nearly 7-year sojourn from the southern tip of Argentina to the northern tip of Alaska. Inspired by their story, MacNiven conceived of the task after learning that his father, whose parents were foreign missionaries, was born in an unknown location in Hokkaid\u014d. Armed with a desire to impress Ayumi and find his father's birthplace, as well as an interest in Japanese culture, MacNiven set sail to Japan."]}, {"page": "Long-distance trail", "response": ["*George Meegan, The Longest Walk \u2013 Odyssey of the Human Spirit (1988); describes an unbroken walk from Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost tip of South America to the northern coast of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay between 1977 and 1983."]}, {"page": "Meegan", "response": ["*George Meegan, British long-distance walker"]}, {"page": "Meegan, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Meegan"]}, {"page": "List of longest walks", "response": ["=== George Meegan ===", "* Details: George Meegan, a British adventurer and former Merchant Navy seaman, hiked across two continents, from the southern tip of South America at Tierra Del Fuego to the northernmost part of Alaska.
