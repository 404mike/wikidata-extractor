He was also involved at the start of construction of two more reservoirs for the Edinburgh Water Company, at Threipmuir and Harlaw, but they were completed by James Leslie in 1847 and 1848, as he retired in 1846. Following his work on the Glencorse Reservoir, he was commissioned to undertake similar improvements in Perth, Dumfries and Glasgow.

James Jardine was the company's first engineer, and was succeeded by James Leslie, who became part of J & A Leslie and Reid, when he entered into partnership with his son Alexander Leslie and son-in-law Robert Reid in the early 1870s. The last major project of this early period was Talla Reservoir, completed in 1905, but there were further civil engineering projects in the 1960s and 1980s. Alexander compiled of dosier of photographs showing the construction of some of the later Victorian reservoirs, which has recently be rediscovered in the archives of Edinburgh Library.", "The new scheme worked well until 1842, when there was a severe drought, resulting in many of the smaller streams and brooks drying up completely. Less than  of rain fell between April and October, and the Glencorse Reservoir emptied. Millers on the River Esk demanded that water from the Crawley springs should be diverted into the Glencorse Burn, and this was only avoided by paying them an indemnity of between \u00a34,000 and \u00a35,000. The Company rushed through an Act of Parliament in 1843 to allow them to abstract water from streams at Listonshiels, Bavelaw and Black Springs, all of which are on the north side of the Pentland Hills. Two more reservoirs were required to provide compensation water, at Threipmuir and Harlaw, and despite difficulties in buying the required land, Jardine pressed on with the project. However, he retired in 1846 before either reservoir had been finished, having reached the age of 70, and it was James Leslie who took over and saw them completed.", "===James Leslie===", "James Leslie took his son Alexander into partnership in 1871, becoming J & A Leslie, and his son-in-law Robert Reid joined about two years later, when the enterprise became J & A Leslie and Reid. Leslie designed the Alnwickhill water treatment works, although the contractors were James Young & Son. It consisted on reservoir holding  of raw water and two slow sand filter settling tanks. Work started on the first phase in 1875, and the works opened in 1879, with a second phase being completed in 1888. The two outlet houses were built in a classical Roman style. Alexander Leslie collected dozens of photographs, showing the construction of some of the later projects, including the dams and filtration plants, workmen, architects and engineers, which he mounted in a book. The book was lost from view, but was found in the archives of the Edinburgh Library, and in 2014 the images were compiled to form an online exhibition."]}, {"page": "John Turnbull of Abbey St Bathans", "response": ["He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1879.
