In The Cambridge Companion to Medievalism (2016), editor Louise D'Arcens noted that some of the earliest medievalism scholarship (that is, study of the phenomenon of medievalism) was by Victorian specialists including Alice Chandler (with her monograph A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth Century England (London: Taylor and Francis, 1971), and Florence Boos, with her edited volume History and Community: Essays in Victorian Medievalism (London: Garland Publishing, 1992)). D'Arcens proposed that the 1970s saw the discipline of medievalism become an academic area of research in its own right, with the International Society for the Study of Medievalism formalised in 1979 with the publication of its Studies In Medievalism journal, organised by Leslie J. Workman. D'Arcens notes that by 2016 medievalism was taught as a subject on \"hundreds\" of university courses around the world, and there were \"at least two\" scholarly journals dedicated to medievalism studies: Studies in Medievalism and postmedieval."]}, {"page": "Christopher Middleton (d. 1628)", "response": ["*John Simons, Christopher Middleton and Elizabethan medievalism, pp.\u00a043\u201360 in Utz, Richard J., 1961-; Shippey, Tom A.
