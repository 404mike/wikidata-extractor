His father was a carpenter in Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire, and he was born on the estate of Dolau Bach there. He was also known as Deio'r Cantwr (Davy the Singer) and Dewi Medi (Harvest Dave). Dafydd Jones gained the name Dewi Dywyll, which means Blind Davy, due to being blinded by accident. He wrote ballads and sang them.He gained his fame for his impromptu singing all over Wales in an age of wandering balladeers who were popular characters. He wrote about 60 ballads \u2014 at least 70 according to the National Library of Wales.\nHe died at Lampeter in 1868.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crinoline", "response": ["Unlike the farthingales and panniers, the crinoline was worn by women of every social class; and the fashion swiftly became the subject of intense scrutiny in Western media.Maxwell, pp.16\u201318Thomas, p.91. Critical articles on the crinoline were published by the Hungarian journal Az \u00dcst\u00f6k\u00f6s (1858) and the Bulgarian journalist Petko Slaveykov in 1864. In the 1850s, the Welsh poet Dafydd Jones wrote a ballad decrying the fashion. A similar sentiment was expressed by a Russian song published in 1854, where the singer complains about his wife having assumed the fashion. In 1855, an observer of Queen Victoria's state visit to Paris complained that despite the number of foreigners present, Western fashions such as the crinoline had diluted national dress to such an extent that everyone, whether Turkish, Scottish, Spanish or Tyrolean, dressed alike.Blau, p.154 Victoria herself is popularly said to have detested the fashion, inspiring a song in Punch that started: \"Long live our gracious Queen/Who won't wear crinoline!\"Gernsheim, p.44. NB: Gernsheim misquotes the rhyme as \"God Save our gracious Queen.\" Gernsheim has noted that the Queen was often photographed in crinolines, and suggests that this misunderstanding came from a request made by Victoria that female guests attending her daughter's marriage in 1858 should leave their hoops off due to limited space in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll) (1803\u20131868)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh writers", "response": ["*Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll, 1803\u20131868, W), balladeer"]}, {"page": "1860s in Wales", "response": ["**date unknown - Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll), balladeer (born 1803)"]}, {"page": "1868 in Wales", "response": ["** Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll), balladeer (born 1803)"]}, {"page": "1803 in Wales", "response": ["**Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll), balladeer (died 1868)"]}, {"page": "Dafydd Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["Dafydd Jones is a Welsh rugby union player.", "Dafydd Jones may also refer to:", "*Dafydd Jones (footballer), Welsh footballer", "*Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll), Welsh balladeer", "*Dafydd Jones (Dafydd Jones o Drefriw) on List of Welsh-language authors", "*Dafydd Jones (Isfoel) on List of Welsh-language authors", "*Dafydd Jones (hymn writer) on List of Welsh-language authors", "*Dafydd Jones (hymnist) from Caio, Carmarthenshire", "*Dafydd Jones (poet) on List of Welsh-language authors"]}, {"page": "Dewi Dywyll", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dafydd Jones (Dewi Dywyll)"]}]}}
