Some members of the cast of the Harry Potter film series criticised Rowling's views or spoke out in support of trans rights, including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Bonnie Wright, and Katie Leung, as did Fantastic Beasts lead actor Eddie Redmayne and the fansites MuggleNet and The Leaky Cauldron.

Rowling described as being by \"a bunch of racists\", adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour (although she did write in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\") and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art.

She returned to New York and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to sleep better. The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of the bed to two activities, one of which would be sleeping.
