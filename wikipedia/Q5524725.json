His first season signings included Mark Leonard from Tranmere Rovers, John Crabbe from Hereford United and David Pullar from Exeter City as Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his first transfer successes were Dave Waller (sold to Shrewsbury Town), Gary Blissett (sold to Brentford) and Geoff Thomas (sold to Crystal Palace); gradually the club moved forward."]}, {"page": "Marcus Gayle", "response": ["Born Hammersmith, London, Gayle started his career at Brentford in 1988, scoring 27 goals in 194 appearances for the Bees. He was loaned to KuPS in 1990, before becoming a regular player in the Brentford side under new manager Phil Holder in 1990\u201391, when the Bees qualified for the playoffs but lost to eventual promotion winners Tranmere Rovers in the semi finals. He played 33 games in the Third Division that season, scoring six goals. He was a key part in their Third Division title success for the 1991\u201392 season, scoring 6 goals in 38 games to give Brentford a place in the new First Division, as the old Second Division would be known from the start of the 1992\u201393 campaign due to the creation of the FA Premier League. The 1992\u201393 season looked as though it would be a successful one for the Bees, who entered the new year in 10th place and on the brink of the playoff zone, with all the talk at Griffin Park being about a second successive promotion and top division football for the first time since 1947. However, a collapse in the second half of the season saw the Bees relegated. Gayle initially remained loyal to the Bees, but on 24 March 1994 he linked up with his old Brentford striker partner Gary Blissett in a \u00a3250,000 move to Wimbledon, who were in the process of finishing a creditable sixth place in the Premier League.
