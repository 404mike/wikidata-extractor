The criticisms were mainly unwarranted in that Swainson did not set out to write a dictionary, nor an etymology, may not have been able to include references to Yarrell's 4th edition (which was published as he was preparing his own book for publication, and was in ill-health), and had no compunction about including \"book-names\" as part of the record.", "Two major works on birds' names followed which cite Swainson as a major source: Harry Kirke Swann's dictionary of bird names, folk-names and lore (1913), which cites Swainson's work ahead of all other sources as \"the first work approaching the scheme of the present volume\", and Lockwood's Oxford dictionary of bird names (1984), which cites The English Dialect Dictionary, and Swainson's list of provincial names which it contains, as the second of its chief sources.", "Charles Swainson's original and compendious research formed the foundation of several subsequent major works of ornithological literature, including Harry Kirke Swann's A Dictionary of English and Folk-Names of British Birds; with their History, Meaning and First Usage, and the Folk-Lore, Weather-Lore, Legends Etc Relating to the More Familiar Species."]}]}}
