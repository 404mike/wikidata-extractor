While other leaders of the International changed their opinions or abandoned politics, Malatesta remained firm in his original convictions for a half-century\". In this sense, only Malatesta \"remained devoted to anarchism by the end of the 1870s\". Goodway argues that Malatesta was able to do so \"by modifying his optimistic approach, substituting one of the more sophisticated versions of anarchism\". Goodway writes that Malatesta developed \"a two-pronged strategy\" by the 1880s and early 1900s. Malatesta sought on one hand \"to unify the anarchist and anti-parliamentary socialists into a new anarchist socialist party\" as \"anarchism was a minority movement within the Italian left\", hence \"Malatesta and his followers hoped to galvanize the elements of regional socialist group (the Fasci Siciliani, the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Romagna, and the Partito Operaio) into a new anti-parliamentary socialist party\". On the other hand, Malatesta was \"one of the first anarchists to stress a syndicalist strategy\" and anarchists \"had to prod the socialists into insurrections and remain a revolutionary conscience afterwards during socialist reconstruction\". Goodway further writes that \"Malatesta defined this type of anarchist communism as 'anarchism without adjectives'\", described by Goodway as \"a concept which he had developed with a group of Spanish anarchist intellectuals in the process mediating between mutually hostile collectivists and communists\". In stressing \"tolerance within the libertarian movement\", Malatesta hoped that \"Marxist socialists would permit the anarchists liberty for their own movement in post-revolutionary society\".Goodway, David.
