Apart from a short month-long break in which original producer Stuart Latham took over for one last stint, Margaret Morris presided over Coronation Street until May, in which she introduced Irma Ogden (Sandra Gough) in late January. Radical young producer Tim Aspinall took the reins in May and quickly made his mark by writing out several characters including Frank Barlow, Harry and Concepta Hewitt, Jerry and Myra Booth and most controversially, Martha Longhurst, a favourite with viewers who Aspinall chose to kill off in his first episode. A week later, Aspinall introduced a new regular in the form of Charlie Moffitt (Gordon Rollings)."]}, {"page": "Badger's Green (1949 film)", "response": ["* Stuart Latham as PC Percy"]}, {"page": "List of people from the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames", "response": ["* Stuart Latham (1912), first producer of Coronation Street"]}, {"page": "Brefni O'Rorke", "response": ["| colspan=2                 | Stuart Latham"]}, {"page": "Made in Heaven (1952 film)", "response": ["* Stuart Latham as Porter\t"]}, {"page": "One Night with You (1948 film)", "response": ["* Stuart Latham as First Writer"]}, {"page": "Help talk:Citation Style 1/Archive 5", "response": ["How should I deal with pipes (\"|\") in URLs, which cause an error, as can be seen in Stuart Latham.
