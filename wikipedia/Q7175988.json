He was the Bishop of Hertford from 1974 to 1981 and the Bishop of Truro from 1981 to 1989.Mumford was educated at Sherborne School and University College, Oxford. After Second World War service with the Royal Artillery he began his ordained ministry as a  curate at St Mark's Salisbury. He was then the  vicar of St Andrew's Bedford, the rector of Crawley and finally, from 1973 until his ordination to the episcopate, the Archdeacon of St Albans. He married Jane and they had two sons and a daughter: his wife survived him.\nMumford wrote an autobiography, including \"reflections\", called Quick-eyed Love Observing (the title alludes to a poem by George Herbert), which was published after his death.\nMumford failed to take action or to launch an investigation into Jeremy Dowlingm (later Dowling was convicted of sex offenses against boys). A review found, that \"There is no doubt that there were a number of missed opportunities for the diocese of Truro to undertake its own investigations into the allegations made in 1972 against Jeremy Dowling.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diocese of Truro", "response": ["A 2018 case review commissioned by the diocese reported that four bishops, Maurice Key, Peter Mumford, Michael Ball and Richard Llewellin, had failed to respond to disclosures of abuse by a leading diocesan figure.Jeremy Dowling review; final; 2018; Diocese of Truro The diocese had failed to investigate the accusations against Jeremy Dowling, a lay preacher and synod member, who rose to influential positions including communications officer to the bishop. Dowling was jailed in 2015 for seven years, and again in 2016 for a further eight years, for a series of indecent assaults on boys while teaching at a Cornish school during the 1960s and 70s. Kim Stevenson, a criminal justice expert, said the report made \"sadly familiar reading\" and she contrasted the situation in Britain with that in Australia where those who concealed or did not act on evidence of a sexual offence faced prosecution."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Truro", "response": ["| 60px Peter Mumford"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Hertford", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 1974 ||align=\"center\"| 1981 || Peter Mumford || (1922\u20131992).
