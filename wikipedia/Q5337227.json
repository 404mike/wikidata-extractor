His most famous role was Hermann in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nEvans was born in Cwrtnewydd, Cardiganshire, Wales.  In all, he sang some 45 roles \u2013 most of them major ones \u2013 at Covent Garden from 1946 \u2013 when, as one of its three principal tenors, he became a founder member of the Covent Garden Opera Company \u2013 to his retirement in 1975. In that time, he sang more roles and more performances at the Opera House than any other artist.\nThose roles included Steva in the first British stage performance of Jen\u016ffa, Zinovy in the British premiere of Katerina Ismailova, The Interpreter and A Celestial Messenger in the premiere of Vaughan Williams' The Pilgrim's Progress, Andres in the first Covent Garden Wozzeck and Captain Davidson in Richard Rodney Bennett's Victory. In addition, he was Dmitri in the company's first Boris Godunov, Hermann in the first Covent Garden Queen of Spades under Kleiber, Gustavus in the first Masked Ball performed at Covent Garden since the War, Aegisthus in the first post-War Elektra, Hellenus in The Trojans conducted by Kubel\u00edk, Narraboth in the Brook-Dal\u00ed Salome, and Froh in the first post-War Covent Garden Ring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912 in music", "response": ["**Edgar Evans, operatic tenor (died 2007)"]}, {"page": "Edgar Evans", "response": ["Petty Officer Edgar Evans (7 March 1876\u00a0\u2013 17 February 1912) was a Welsh naval seaman and member of the \"Polar Party\" in Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition to the South Pole in 1911\u20131912.  This group of five men, personally selected for the final expedition push, attained the Pole on 17 January 1912. The party perished as they attempted to return to the base camp.", "Edgar Evans then joined Scott's first Antarctic expedition in Discovery in 1901\u20131904. Along with William Lashly, he accompanied Scott on his \"Furthest West\" sledge journey to the interior of Victoria Land in 1903.", "On 16 February 1912, nearing the base of the glacier, Evans collapsed. The next morning, unable to keep up, he was left behind while the others went ahead man-hauling the sledge towards the next supply depot; they had to make a return journey to fetch him. Scott's diary described Evans's condition when they found him; 'He was on his knees, clothing disarranged, hands uncovered and frostbitten and with a \"wild look in his eyes\". He was placed onto a sledge and taken to the camp they had set up. By the time he was placed in the tent, he was comatose. He died in the tent that night. It was not recorded what was done with his body, and none of the other members of the polar party survived the return journey. His widow, Lois (they had married in 1904 and had three children), had a plaque placed, in his memory, in the Norman church at Rhossili. It reads \"To the Glory of God and in memory of Edgar Evans 1st Class Petty Officer, R.N., and a native of this Parish, who perished on 17 February 1912, when returning from the South Pole with the Southern Party of the British Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, C.V.O., R.N. 'To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield.'\"", "Evans was also remembered at the naval shore establishment on Whale Island, Portsmouth where the Edgar Evans Building was opened in 1964, the first to be named after a petty officer rather than an admiral. The building was demolished in 2010, but a new accommodation block was named after Evans. The new building contains a memorial to him that incorporates two skis he used in Antarctica. An award, named the 'Edgar Evans Award', is also given each year to the highest placed student of all Petty Officer (Missile) courses for that year.", "There is also a commemorative plaque on the Scott lighthouse memorial in Roath Park Lake in Cardiff, South Wales, which lists all of the crew members including Evans. Evans N\u00e9v\u00e9, Victoria Land, is named in honour of Edgar Evans.", "In the film Scott of the Antarctic, Edgar Evans was played by James Robertson Justice. In the Central TV production The Last Place on Earth, Evans was played by Pat Roach, and in BBC Radio 4's The Worst Journey in the World by Huw Davies.", "*Williams, Isobel (2012): Captain Scott's Invaluable Assistant Edgar Evans.
