But by the next day, journalist Tom Gross noted that the online articles had been edited, replacing \"terrorists\" by \"bombers\". In another case, March 28, 2007, the BBC paid almost $400,000 in legal fees in a London court to keep an internal memo dealing with alleged anti-Israeli bias from becoming public. The BBC has been accused of having a pro-Israel bias."]}, {"page": "Rachel Corrie", "response": ["Tom Gross, in an article called \"The Forgotten Rachels\", discusses six other women named Rachel who were Jewish victims of Palestinian terrorism in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Their deaths, he wrote, received little if any coverage outside Israel. Alt URL Gross went on to argue that \"partly because of the efforts of Corrie's fellow activists in the ISM, the Israeli army was unable to stop the flow of weapons through the tunnels.... Those weapons were later used to kill Israeli children ... in southern Israel\". The article prompted a National Review editorial arguing \"Corrie's death was unfortunate, but more unfortunate is a Western media and cultural establishment that lionizes 'martyrs' for illiberal causes while ignoring the victims those causes create.\" Explaining the Israeli court's ruling, judge Oded Gershon said Corrie's death was \"the result of an accident she brought upon herself.\" Corrie was in a closed military area, with entry forbidden to civilians. The area was the site of daily gunfire by snipers, missile fire and IED explosions. The United States government had issued a travel warning against American citizens visiting the Gaza Strip. \"She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done,\" the judge ruled."]}, {"page": "Sonia Orwell", "response": ["Brownell had several godchildren and was very close to some of them.
