He initially sent out a leaflet announcing the beginning of the Peace Tax Campaign, and began a campaign of letter writing, lectures and organising meetings to bring together those with similar ideas. People were actively encouraged to write to their MPs to change the law, something Conscience continues to do today. A letter to the Guardian newspaper signed by both MPs and religious leaders brought the campaign to national attention in 1981, leading to over 3,000 supporters and 50 local co-ordinators to join the campaign. In 1981 Alex Lyon MP put forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to allow those with a \"conscientious objection to paying for expenditure on defence\" to pay the military part of their taxes to the then Ministry of Overseas Development.Records of the Peace Tax Campaign This, though unsuccessful, was the first attempt to enable such legislation in the UK.
