He made his club debut on 17 August against St Mirren in a 1\u20131 draw, setting up Kris Boyd for Killie's goal. He provided another assist for Boyd in Kilmarnock's 1\u20131 draw with Partick Thistle on 21 September, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 5\u20132 defeat by Celtic on 28 September. He picked up his second goal of the campaign as Kilmarnock fell to a 3\u20131 defeat at the hands of St Johnstone on 8 November. Inconsistent performances led to Clohessy being replaced by youngster Ross Barbour in the second half of the season, and he struggled to regain his first-team position. After making 24 appearances, Clohessy was released by the club in June 2014."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["| Ross Barbour"]}, {"page": "Ross Barbour", "response": ["Ross Barbour may refer to:", "*Ross Barbour (footballer) (born 1993), Scottish footballer", "*Ross Barbour (rugby league) (born 1981), Irish rugby league player", "*Ross Barbour (singer) (1928\u20132011), American singer with The Four Freshmen"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["| Ross Barbour"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["| Ross Barbour"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Ross Barbour"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Ross Barbour"]}]}}
