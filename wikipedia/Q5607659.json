She is the aunt of well known Castleford personality Kathryn Jones. \nWorking in mountain areas in Nepal during her first two decades in the country led her to accept the task of establishing a publishing and PR unit for the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a regional organisation which operates at the interface of research and development in the eight countries of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas in 1989. She continued to build on this unit, now a sizeable programme, until her retirement at the end of 2004.\nIn 1991 Greta Rana was joint winner of the Arnsberger Internationale Kurzprosa and in that year she delivered a paper at the International PEN Congress in Vienna on 'Mondialism: The Future Looking at the Past,' which outlines the unchangeability of human nature across cultures and continents based on three recurring themes from the Iliad and the Mahabharat;viz.,\n'War is futile' but war is inevitable, and it is the duty of the warrior to fight.  Against such human destructiveness, the future lies not in the call to conform as in the call to \"When in Rome do as the Romans do,\" but in a human capacity to tolerate and celebrate difference and the whole kaleidoscope of human cultures and creativity.\nA committed interest in children's education, especially children whose families cannot afford to send them to school, led to the founding of the 'New Shakespeare Wallahs' an amateur drama group working under the auspices of the Nepal Britain Society to raise money for children's education amongst the poorest communities.  Brief periods of residence in Laos and Afghanistan in the late 70s and early 80s, besides her time in Nepal, have given her a unique outlook on what the author refers to as \"the colonisation by development aid.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nepalese literature", "response": ["Nepalis writing in English first came to prominence with Laxmi Prasad Devkota's own translations of his Nepali poems in the 1950s. Devkota is believed to be the first Nepali to begin writing creatively in English. Devkota also penned some essays in English which were published posthumously by his son, Dr. Padma Devkota in a book titled 'The Witch Doctor and Other Essays'.  After Devkota came writers like Mani Dixit, Tek Bahadur Karki, Abhi Subedi and Peter J Karthak who began writing in English from the 60s onwards. During the 70s and 80s, these pioneers were joined by writers like Kesar Lall, Greta Rana, Kesang Tseten, and DB Gurung. It was only in 2001 that Nepali writing in English received international attention with the publication of Samrat Upadhyay's Arresting God in Kathmandu. Published in the United States, the collection of short stories won the Whiting Award for Fiction. Since then, a number of prominent Nepali writers writing in English have emerged, most notably Manjushree Thapa whose nonfiction book, Forget Kathmandu: An Elegy for Democracy, was nominated for the 2006 Lettre Ulysses Award.
