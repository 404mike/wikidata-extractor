After school, he visited shops in Lewisham, then travelled by bus to an uncle's house in Grove Park.  He was joined there by Duwayne Brooks, and they played video games until leaving at around 10:00 pm. After realising that the 286 bus on which they were travelling would get them home late, they decided to change for either bus route 161 or bus route 122 on Well Hall Road.", "In September 1994, Lawrence's family initiated a private prosecution against the initial two suspects and three others: Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and David Norris. The family were not entitled to legal aid and a fighting fund was established to pay for the analysis of forensic evidence and the cost of tracing and re-interviewing witnesses. The family were represented by counsel Michael Mansfield QC, Martin Soorjoo and Margo Boye who all worked pro bono. The charges against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were dropped before the trial for lack of evidence. On 23 April 1996, the three remaining suspects were acquitted of murder by a jury at the Central Criminal Court, after the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Curtis, ruled that the identification evidence given by Duwayne Brooks was unreliable. The Macpherson report endorsed the judgement, stating that \"Mr Justice Curtis could [have] properly reach[ed] only one conclusion\" and that \"[t]here simply was no satisfactory evidence available\".", "On 10 March 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service announced that it would pay Duwayne Brooks \u00a3100,000 as compensation for the manner in which police had handled his complaints about their actions toward him after the murder."]}, {"page": "Pirate radio in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Political programming has been a feature of the many black community pirate radio stations that have grown in the UK since the 1980s. For the likes of Galaxy Radio, part of their mission is to: \"de-brainwash the black community\". The station combines reggae and soca with robust articulation of \"black empowerment against a system designed our oppress our brothers and sisters\" and live phone-in discussions. Genesis Radio, launched in the early 1990s, follows a similar format. Duwayne Brooks, councillor and friend of Stephen Lawrence who was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, has in the past urged police to work with community stations such as Genesis in order to improve \"police engagement with the community\" and \"run our own appeals for information after incidents\". Where black community stations have also been effective is to raise awareness and raise funds for local concerns, often where mainstream media has overlooked them. In 2002, Powerjam launched an appeal through one of its talk shows to raise money to save a young girl from a rare tissue disease."]}, {"page": "Lewisham College", "response": ["*Duwayne Brooks, Liberal Democrat politician"]}, {"page": "Brooks (surname)", "response": ["*Duwayne Brooks (born 1974), English politician"]}, {"page": "2012 London mayoral election", "response": ["Around the beginning of September 2010, the Liberal Democrats started accepting applications for their nominee.

The police officers who arrived at the scene regarded Brooks with suspicion. According to an official inquiry, \"the officers failed to concentrate upon Mr Brooks and to follow up energetically the information which he gave them. Nobody suggested that he should be used in searches of the area, although he knew where the assailants had last been seen. Nobody appears properly to have tried to calm him, or to accept that what he said was true.\" That is, the police officers failed to view Brooks as a credible witness, presumably in part due to racial bias. This was, says Fricker, a case of testimonial injustice, which occurs when \"prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker\u2019s word.\""]}, {"page": "The Murder of Stephen Lawrence", "response": ["* Joseph Kpobie as Duwayne Brooks"]}, {"page": "1993 Welling riots", "response": ["74 people were injured in the riots, including 12 police officers.
