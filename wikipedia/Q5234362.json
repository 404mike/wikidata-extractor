Despite his youth he was immediately propelled into the first team, making his debut against Notts County on 2 September 1908, the first game of the 1908-09 First Division season. He only missed two games that season and went on established himself as a regular fixture on the wing for the following four seasons.However, after veteran FA Cup-winner Jock Rutherford signed in November 1913 for Arsenal, Greenaway was dropped to make way for him, and he only played 14 league matches in two seasons. World War I then intervened, with all league football cancelled, and Greenaway was called up to fight, serving with the Royal Field Artillery. He returned to Arsenal in 1919 after peacetime led to the resumption of league football, but only played for the first-team three times over the next two seasons. In total he played 170 times for Arsenal, scoring 13 times, before leaving the club in 1921 on a free transfer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Witches (1990 film)", "response": ["The following people did special puppeteer work in this film: Anthony Asbury, Don Austen (Bruno's mouse form), Sue Dacre, David Greenaway, Brian Henson, Robert Tygner, and Steve Whitmire (Luke's mouse form).

Select season required. Arsenal lost 5\u20130, and the Daily News reporter thought their forwards' shooting was the worst he had seen all season and \"the only member of the line who was not greatly at fault was Winship, a small youth who was playing as outside left and delighted the crowd by sprightliness and accurate centring from all positions.\" A fortnight later, the Sheffield Daily Telegraph described Arsenal as having \"a couple of capable, enterprising wingers, though Winship was a bit late waking up\" in a 3\u20132 defeat to Sheffield United. He had a run of seven league matches, counting the visit of Aston Villa abandoned because of bad light, before Charles Lewis took over at outside left and David Greenaway returned to the side on the right wing."]}, {"page": "Greenaway, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Greenaway"]}]}}
