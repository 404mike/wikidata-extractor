From 1959 to 1977, he performed the  role of the conniving Chief Petty Officer Pertwee in The Navy Lark on BBC Radio. The fictional ship in the series HMS Troutbridge almost shared its name with the real HMS Troubridge whose commanding officer was a relative of Pertwee's who wrote to the BBC to provide details of comic incidents on the ship which were then used in  The Navy Lark's scripts. After Ronnie Barker left the series Pertwee took on various additional roles in the series. These included a villainous character called the Master, whose voice Pertwee said was an impression of Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Pertwee did not appear in the 1959 film version of The Navy Lark. In his 1996 memoir he attributed this to producer Herbert Wilcox refusing to employ his co-star Dennis Price on the grounds that \"he was gay\", a decision Pertwee made clear that he thought \"was ridiculous\". Shortly after voicing his support of Price he found out he had been dropped  from the film's cast and replaced by Ronald Shiner."]}, {"page": "1942 in music", "response": ["* The Balloon Goes Up, starring Ethel Revnell, Gracie West, Donald Peers and Ronald Shiner.

The setting was changed where \"The Island\" was named Boonsey, a fictional Channel Island. According to Jon Pertwee's co-written memoir, published shortly after his death in 1996, the film was also supposed to star Pertwee and Dennis Price. However, according to Pertwee the film's producer Herbert Wilcox refused to employ Price \"because he was gay.\" Pertwee was among those who objected to Price not being in the film and believed that this contributed to his own replacement in the cast by Shiner. Pertwee noted that the film \"bombed\" and said audiences did not consider the film to be The Navy Lark due to the absence of himself, Price and Stephen Murray."]}, {"page": "Diana Dors", "response": ["Dors landed the female lead supporting Ronald Shiner in Worm's Eye View (1951), a comedy which was one of the most popular movies of 1951 in Britain; her fee was \u00a3250.
