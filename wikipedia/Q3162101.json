Bristol City spent most of the season 1960\u201361 in mid table. Atyeo missed a few early games but by October the forward line took on a fairly consistent look. Jimmy Rogers on the right wing partnered Atyeo at inside right. While Bristol youngsters Bobby Williams & Jantzen Derrick formed the left flank. New signing Alex Tait costing \u00a35,000 from Newcastle United was the centre forward. Atyeo made 37 appearances scoring 19 goals including a hat-trick in the final game of the season in a 3\u20130 win v Brentford. This made Atyeo leading goalscorer once again with Tait scoring 15 goals. In the FA Cup Chichester City forfeited home advantage in the 1st round on 5 November 1960 and Bristol City scored a record highest ever FA Cup win by 11\u20130 with Atyeo scoring five goals.

Two local Bristol boys Brian Clark and Roger \"Lou\" Peters who had both made their debuts in the final game v Brentford in 1961\u201362 were given increased chances at inside right and outside left respectively. Overall the forward line was consistent with the previous season. Jimmy Rogers scored only four goals in his final season with the \"Robins\" on the right wing. Alex Tait scored 13 goals from centre forward while \"Shadow\" Wiliams netted 21 goals from inside left. Jantzen Derrick also scored four goals from the left wing. Atyeo was again top scorer with 26 goals from 42 appearances including hat-tricks in a 3\u20130 win v Grimsby Town in October and in a 4\u20130 win at Swindon Town in March. Atyeo also scored four goals in a 6\u20130 win v Notts County on 16 December 1961.", "Heavy snow fell on Boxing Day 1962 and stayed on the ground until a major thaw at the beginning of March 1963. During January Bristol City played only a single FA Cup 3rd round tie with the replay taking place on 7 March 1963 when City lost 2\u20133 at Aston Villa. Bristol City played only home games between the away defeats in league matches at Millwall on 15 December and at Swindon Town on 2 March. The backlog in fixtures led to Bristol City playing 8 matches in April and 4 in May a total of 12 games in 43 days at the end of the season. Atyeo only played in three of these backlog fixtures with Tait switching from right wing to centre forward. Bristol City scored 100 league goals but conceded 92 during the season. The \"Robins\" kept only three clean sheets, all in September, and failed to score in only four matches. Atyeo moved to centre forward for most of his 30 appearances scoring 16 goals and finishing behind both \"Shadow\" Williams and top scorer Brian Clark in the goal scoring charts. In a season of goals all five of the regular forward line reached double figures for goals. Both wingers Alex Tait and Jantzen Derrick scored ten goals, while inside forwards Clark netted 23 times and Williams scored 19 goals. Even Barrie Meyer the Gloucestershire cricketer scored seven goals in 6 games when deputising for Atyeo.

Alex Tait was the first signing by Fred Ford for \u00a35,000 in June 1960 from Newcastle United for Bristol City. Bristol City had just been relegated to the Third Division as Alex Tait made his debut at centre forward in a 4\u20130 win v Barnsley on 27 August 1960. Tait retained the no.9 shirt for the rest of the season with John Atyeo playing alongside as the dual strike force at inside right. City finished in mid table 14th position in 1960-61 when Tait made 35 appearances scoring 15 goals and Atyeo top scored with 19 goals. Tait scored two goals in a 2\u20135 defeat at Grimsby Town and another two goals in a 3\u20130 win v Newport County. He also played in the FA Cup 4th round replay 1\u20135 defeat at Leicester City. Both Brian Clark and Barrie Meyer were tried as partner to John Atyeo at the start of 1961-62 but with Bristol City lying in 13th place Tait came back as centre forward in October and held the position until the final two games of the season as Bristol City finished in 6th place in the Third Division. In 1961-62 Tait made 34 appearances scoring 13 goals including two goals in the 6\u20130 win v Notts County when Atyeo netted the other four goals. In the FA Cup Tait scored in both 1st round ties and then netted a hat-trick in the 8\u20132 win v Dartford in the 2nd round. The following season Tait began at centre forward but switched to outside right after four matches when Atyeo moved to centre forward and Brian Clark was introduced at inside right. City recovered from 20th place to finish in mid table at 14th with Tait making 37 appearances scoring 10 goals mainly on the right wing but deputising at centre forward for the injured Atyeo in the final games of the season. The \"Robins\" rose to 5th place in 1963-64 but Jantzen Derrick and Peter Hooper were the regular wingers with Tait making only 11 appearances without scoring when deputising for the regular wingers. Alex Tait moved to Doncaster Rovers in June 1964 and then onto Burton Albion in the summer of 1965 taking over as player manager from Peter Taylor. Burton Albion won promotion to the Premier Division of the Southern League by finishing 3rd in the First Division in the first season of Alex Tait's management."]}, {"page": "Roger Peters", "response": ["Lou Peters played youth football for Bristol City. Peters signed as a professional for Bristol City in March 1961. Manager Fred Ford gave Peters his league debut at outside right in the final Third Division match in 1960\u201361 in a 3\u20130 win v Brentford on 29 April 1961. Jimmy Rogers was the regular outside right as City rose to 6th place in 1961\u201362. Peters started the season at outside left but had to share the left wing duties with Jantzen Derrick and made only 13 appearances scoring his first goal in the final game of the season on 28 April 1962 in a 2\u20132 draw v Crystal Palace. Peters had a mid season spell in the side the following season, firstly on the right wing in place of Alex Tait and then on the left wing in place of Derrick. Peters made 19 appearances scoring three goals as the \"Robins\" slipped to 14th place in the table in 1962\u201363. In 1963-64 Bristol City recovered to 5th place in the Third Division but Peters failed to make the first team with Derrick playing outside right and new signing Peter Hooper the regular on the left wing. Peters returned to the left wing at the start of the following season making 40 appearances scoring six goals including 2 goals in the 3\u20130 win v Port Vale on 27 February 1965. This was the promotion season as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division. Peters started the Second Division campaign in the outside right position with Hooper on the left wing but switched to the left wing when Derrick replaced Hooper in October. In 1965-66 Bristol City finished 5th in the Second Division and Peters made 35 appearances scoring six goals. Bristol City struggled against relegation for much of 1966\u201367. The emergence of Danny Bartley on the left wing at the start of the season restricted Peters and Derrick to sharing the outside right position but at Christmas Peters reclaimed the outside left position with City lying 19th and retained the no.11 shirt for the rest of the season as City finished clear of relegation in 15th place. Peters made 28 appearances and was top scorer with nine goals in 1966-67 including a run of 7 goals in the final 12 league games. Peters also netted two goals against Halifax Town in the FA Cup as City reached the 5th round before losing 0\u20132 at Tottenham Hotspur. The following season saw Bristol City stave off relegation after a season long struggle finishing in 19th place. Peters had several spells in the first team making 22 appearances without scoring on the left wing sharing duties with Bartley in 1967\u201368. Peters also played in 3 FA Cup ties as City reached the 5th round again before losing 0\u20132 at Leeds United."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Ligue 1 players: E", "response": ["* Jantzen Derrick \u2013 Paris SG \u2013 1971\u201372"]}, {"page": "List of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Jantzen Derrick"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jantzen Derrick"]}]}}
