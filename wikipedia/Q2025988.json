Both Chuks Aneke and Luke Freeman made their home debuts for the club, with both having chances to win the match.", "Stevenage's thirteen game unbeaten run ended on 2 January 2012, losing 1\u20130 at home to Leyton Orient thanks to a first-half strike from Lee Cook. Leyton Orient were reduced to ten men in the first-half, with Ben Chorley receiving a red card for an off-the-ball incident with Chris Beardsley. Stevenage substitute Chuks Aneke was also sent-off in the second half for a high-footed challenge. In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz. Shortly after the interval, Stevenage had doubled their advantage when Freeman beat his man down the left, before laying the ball to Chris Beardsley, who in-turn rolled the ball to the onrushing Lawrie Wilson, who scored with a first-time finish. Rochdale reduced the two-goal deficit when loanee Brett Ormerod finished well from Daniel Bogdanovic's driven cross. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly, Lawrie Wilson ran onto Mark Roberts' ball, before finishing neatly past Kurucz. Rochdale defender Joe Widdowson was given a second yellow card shortly after for a foul on Beardsley. Five minutes later, the visitors had a fourth goal, Freeman cut in from the right wing and unleashed a 25-yard drive into the top corner of the goal. Freeman was again involved in Stevenage's fifth goal, whipping in a cross from the left that Byrom side-footed home. Roberts remained in charge for the club's trip to Scunthorpe United a week later, on 21 January, with the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw. Scunthorpe took the lead shortly after the half-time interval, with Garry Thompson collecting a Mark Duffy long ball before firing into the net from 12-yards out. Substitutes Robin Shroot and Darius Charles combined to ensure Stevenage earned a point from the match, with Shroot bringing down Lawrie Wilson's cross into the path of Charles, who turned quickly to beat the outstretched Sam Slocombe from six yards. Stevenage returned to Broadhall Way three days later, after three successive away fixtures in all competitions, hosting Milton Keynes Dons. The away side took the lead after just two minutes, when former Stevenage loanee Jay O'Shea finished from close range after Chris Day had palmed away Adam Smith's cross. Stevenage drew level midway through the first-half following a neat interchange between Luke Freeman and Lawrie Wilson, with Freeman laying the ball off to Michael Bostwick, who unleashed a 25-yard strike into the bottom left corner of the goal. On the hour mark, MK Dons defender Mathias Doumb\u00e9 was sent-off for a second bookable offence after bringing down Chris Beardsley on the edge of the area. Stevenage took the lead from the resulting free-kick, with Scott Laird heading in Freeman's cross. The hosts had doubled their advantage three minutes later, Freeman again supplying the cross that was met by the head of Darius Charles, who firmly headed past MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin. With five minutes remaining, MK Dons scored their second goal of the game, with O'Shea crossing the ball for substitute Tom Flanagan to head into the net from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly when Charles worked his way into the box before firing the ball across the face of the goal, which was turned in by MK Dons defender Gary MacKenzie.", "|MF|| Chuks Aneke || Arsenal|| 22 November 2011 || 6 March 2012||"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premier Reserve League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Chuks Aneke"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["Arsenal then travelled to the Far East, in a tour similar to that they embarked upon before their 2011\u201312 season.

From there, they travelled to China to play fellow Premier League team Manchester City in Beijing in the inaugural China Cup.

The away side took the lead after just five minutes; Chris Day spilled Marc Richards' free-kick, and Paul Parry was there to prod the ball into the goal on the rebound. Stevenage equalised twenty minutes later when Darius Charles ran from his own half before striking a curling shot from 25-yards that beat Chris Weale in the Shrewsbury goal. A 2\u20131 away victory against recently relegated Coventry City followed on 9 September, with the game being televised live on Sky Sports. Coventry took the lead after eleven minutes when loanee David McGoldrick turned on the edge of the area, before striking a curling effort into the top corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised ten minutes later when a counterattack culminated with a Luke Freeman shot being parried into the path of an onrushing Robin Shroot, who swept the ball home from just inside the area. The comeback was completed with twenty minutes remaining, substitute Marcus Haber heading in Darius Charles' flick on from a Freeman corner. Six days later, Stevenage faced newly promoted Crewe Alexandra at Broadhall Way. Crewe started brightly and opened the scoring after just six minutes. A Gregor Robertson free-kick was blocked, but found its way to Max Clayton on the left wing, who rifled the ball across goal where A-Jay Leitch-Smith was on hand to connect from close range. Leitch-Smith doubled Crewe's advantage almost instantly, running on to a neat Chuks Aneke pass before finishing calmly with a low driven shot. Luke Freeman halved Stevenage's deficit midway through the first-half when he unleashed a shot from 25-yards, following good work from Patrick Agyemang and Lucas Akins, which left Crewe goalkeeper Alan Martin rooted to the spot. Former Stevenage loanee, Aneke, was sent-off for Crewe in the second half for a two-footed tackle on Anthony Grant. The home side made their numerical advantage count when substitute Robin Shroot scored with a neat turn and finish with ten minutes remaining. A 3\u20131 home victory over Walsall followed on 18 September. Robin Shroot had given Stevenage a first-half lead with a tidy finish from outside the area, before Walsall's George Bowerman equalised on the hour mark. The home side restored their lead through Greg Tansey, who scored with a driven shot from 30-yards, his first goal for the club. Lucas Akins sealed the victory late-on, when he steered in Tansey's cross at the back post. A week later, on 22 September, Stevenage drew 1\u20131 at Doncaster Rovers. Loan signing Oliver Risser headed Stevenage into the lead, before Doncaster's Chris Brown levelled in the second-half. The month ended with a 2\u20132 against Bury at Broadhall Way. The visitors, under the new management of Kevin Blackwell, opened the scoring through Tom Hopper's looping header. After the interval, Stevenage scored twice within the space of two minutes to turn the game on its head. Marcus Haber headed in Luke Freeman's corner to restore parity, before Greg Tansey scored a curling long-range strike. Bury equalised through second-half substitute Mark Cullen, to ensure a share of the spoils.", "The new year began with a 1\u20130 defeat by Walsall at the Bescot Stadium on 1 January. A long-range Jamie Paterson strike with three minutes remaining was enough to settle the game. Four days later, Stevenage travelled to Crewe looking for their first win in a month. The game ended 2\u20131 to Stevenage, coming back from a first-half deficit to take all three points. Former Stevenage loanee, Chuks Aneke, had given Crewe the lead with a calm side-footed effort mid-way through the first period. Stevenage replied twice within the space of five second-half minutes; first Lucas Akins tapped in Anthony Grant's centre, before Akins' flick-on gave Marcus Haber room to run and slide the ball through Steve Phillips' legs in the Crewe goal. A week later, on 12 January, Stevenage's bad home form continued when they lost 2\u20131 to promotion chasing Doncaster Rovers. Doncaster, without a manager at the time of the game due to Dean Saunders leaving for Wolverhampton Wanderers, scored twice late-on to secure victory after Stevenage had led through James Dunne's powerful half-volley. The defeat meant that Stevenage were without a home win in six league matches. Stevenage's scheduled away game against Bury on 19 January was postponed as a result of heavy snowfall in the days leading up to the fixture. The Gigg Lane pitch failed an 11:30am inspection a day before the match was due to be played."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["*7 September 2012: Midfielder Chuks Aneke becomes Crewe's second loanee of the season signing an initial one month contract from Arsenal.", "| Chuks Aneke", "| Chuks Aneke", "|26||  || MF || Chuks Aneke || 1 || 1 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 1 || 1", "|26||MF|| Chuks Aneke|| Arsenal||Loan||7 September 2012||"]}, {"page": "2013 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|ST ||26 || Chuks Aneke || "]}]}}
