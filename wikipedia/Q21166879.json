V. Boys at the Royal College of Science and received his bachelor's degree in 1890. At the Royal College of Science, Watson was appointed demonstrator in physics in 1890, assistant professor in 1897, and professor in 1915. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901.At the beginning of his career, Watson was an assistant to Professors A. W. Rucker and Thomas Edward Thorpe in the great magnetic survey of the British Isles from 1890 to 1895. He assisted C. V. Boys in radio-micrometer experiments, in timing the periodicity of spark generators' electrical discharges, and in photographing the flight of bullets. He worked with J. W. Rodger in investigating the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarisation in liquids. He designed and built self-recording magnetographs which were used at Kew, Eskdalemuir, and other observatories. His textbooks of physics, Textbook of Physics, Intermediate Physics, and Practical Physics, became popular and were widely used.As a member of the Expert and Technical Committee of the Royal Automobile Club, Watson created specially designed instruments to investigate and develop the petrol motor. He assisted W. de W. Abney in experiments on colour vision.Upon the poison gas attacks in April 1915, Watson was sent to France to experiment with defensive countermeasures and in May 1915 made the first Allied experiments on a gas-cloud in the field. In June 1915, the British Army established the Central Laboratory with Watson as director. He was personally involved in the systematic collection and examination of the German shells and fuses used for the gas attacks. During these field investigations he was frequently gassed with a variety of poisons. In the last great gas attack of the war, Watson was a victim and eventually succumbed in hospital. He is commemorated on the war memorial at Golders Green Crematorium.In addition to the Royal Automobile Club, Watson was a member of the Savile Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Watson", "response": ["* William Watson (songwriter) (1794\u20131840), English concert hall singer and songwriter", "* William Watson (poet) (1858\u20131935), English poet", "* William Watson (writer) (1930\u20132005), also known as Bill Watson, Scottish writer", "* William Watson (sergeant) (1826\u20131906), in the Confederate States Army", "* William Watson (surgeon) (1837\u20131879), in Pennsylvania Volunteers during the American Civil War", "* William Watson (16th century MP), MP for the City of York", "* William Watson (New South Wales politician) (1815\u20131877), Australian politician", "* William Watson (Australian politician) (1864\u20131938), Australian politician", "* William Watson, mayor of Rockford, Illinois, U.S., 1878\u201379", "* William Watson (scientist) (1715\u20131787), English physician and scientist", "* William Watson (physician) (1744\u20131824), English physician and naturalist", "* William Watson (surveyor and scientist) (1784\u20131857), cartographer and sundial-maker from Seaton Ross", "* Watson Cheyne or Sir William Watson (1852\u20131932), 1st Baronet Cheyne, Scottish surgeon and bacteriologist", "* William Watson (botanist) (1858\u20131925), British botanist and horticulturalist", "* William Watson (physicist) (1868\u20131919), British physicist", "* William Watson (Scottish physicist) (1884\u20131952), FRSE Scottish physicist and mathematician", "* William Watson (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1898), Scottish footballer (Falkirk FC and Scotland)", "* William Watson (footballer) (fl. 1903\u20131909), Lincoln City footballer active in the 1900s", "* William Watson (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u2013?), Scottish footballer (Dumbarton FC)", "* William Watson (cricketer, born 1881) (1881\u20131926), Australian cricketer", "* William Watson (motoring pioneer) (1873\u20131961), British racing driver and motoring pioneer", "* William Watson (weightlifter), British Olympic weightlifter", "* William Watson (decathlete) (1916\u20131973), aka \"Big Bill\" Watson, American track and field athlete", "* William Watson (basketball) (fl. 1920s), African-American basketball player", "* William Watson (priest) (1559\u20131603), English Roman Catholic priest and conspirator", "* William Watson, Baron Watson (1827\u20131899), Scottish judge", "* William Watson, Baron Thankerton (1873\u20131948), Scottish judge", "* William Watson (sinologist) (1917\u20132007), professor of Chinese art and archaeology at London University", "* William Watson (bow maker) (1930\u2013?), British bow maker", "* William Watson (chess player) (born 1962), English chess grandmaster", "* William Watson (economist), Canadian economist, member of the research advisory board for Macdonald\u2013Laurier Institute"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society W, X, Y, Z", "response": ["|Henry William Watson||02/06/1881||25 February 1827 \u2013 11 January 1903", "|William Watson||09/04/1741||3 April 1715 \u2013 10 May 1787 Chemist", "|William Watson||10/12/1767||? 28 August 1744 \u2013 c. 1825 Physician & Astronomer", "|William Watson||07/04/1808||c. 1759 \u2013 1 June 1818 Sergeant-at-arms", "|William Watson||06/06/1901||4 August 1868 \u2013 3 March 1919 Asst Prof of Physics, RCS, London"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1901", "response": ["*William Watson  (1868\u20131919), British physicist"]}]}}
