It was around the same time that he'd started BGP Records, a sub-label of Ace Records focused on soul, funk and jazz dance, together with DJ Baz Fe Jazz. Playing alongside fellow London DJ Patrick Forge, the night, dubbed Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Something, ran for five years. It coincided with the rise of acid house in UK clubland and would grow to establish itself as a legendary session. The sessions were characterised by jazz dancers in suits, hats and spats, well-known jazz dance classics including tracks from Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Airto, Herbie Hancock, and the anthemic In The Fast Lane by Jean-Luc Ponty; but the jazz was fused with hip-hop and the more experimental tracks. It was at a Special Branch show, with fellow DJ Chris Bangs, that the term \"acid jazz\" was coined, starting as an in-joke. At the time, acid house was in the ascendant, and at one of the shows Bangs played a rare groove record, grabbed the mic and shouted: \"Fuck that, if that was acid house, this is acid jazz!\u201d. In 1988, Peterson and Eddie Piller founded Acid Jazz Records, a label whose roster included the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai, Corduroy, the James Taylor Quartet and Snowboy."]}, {"page": "Sfinks Festival", "response": ["N'Java, Simentera, Lo'Jo Triban, Transglobal Underground, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart, Ngaari Laaw, N'Java, Gary Thomas & Hossam Ramzy, Simentera, Gitans ft Thierry Robin, The Last Poets, Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, Baaba Maal, Tierra Caliente, Snowboy, N'Dai N'Dai, Cheb Mami, Les Quatre \u00c9toiles, Psamim, Gulabo Sapera, Tammurriata Di Scafati, A Filetta, Tuareg Bali, Juan Jose Mosalini Y Su Gran Orchestra De Tango, Cheb Khaled, I Muvrini, Lo'Jo Triban, The Klezmatics, The Western Diamonds, Papa Jube & The Jubelation Band, The Academy Brass Band and Ko\u010dani Orkestar"]}, {"page": "Phoenix Festival", "response": ["Snowboy & The Latin Section", "Snowboy", "Snowboy & The Latin Section"]}, {"page": "The Chillout Project: Acid Jazz", "response": ["# Snowboy - Girl Overboard"]}, {"page": "The New Mastersounds", "response": ["As a band, and as individuals, the New Mastersounds have collaborated with an array of musicians DJs and producers, including: Soul Rebels Brass Band, Lou Donaldson (Blue Note), Corinne Bailey Rae (EMI), Quantic (Tru Thoughts), Carleen Anderson (Young Disciples / Brand New Heavies), Keb Darge & Kenny Dope (Kay Dee Records), John Arnold (Ubiquity), Mr Scruff (Ninja Tuna), Snowboy (Ubiquity), Fred Everything (2020 Vision), Andy Smith (Portishead), James Taylor (JTQ), LSK (Faithless), and Karl Denson (Lenny Kravitz, Greyboy AllStars)."]}, {"page": "Acid Jazz Records", "response": ["*Snowboy"]}, {"page": "Xen Cuts", "response": ["# \"Los Locos Cubanos (Snowboy's Batarumbaconga mix)\" - Up, Bustle and Out  \u2013 4:23"]}, {"page": "London Warsaw New York", "response": ["* Snowboy \u2013 percussion (1, 3, 10), congas (2), berimbau (4), shaker (4)"]}, {"page": "Bray Jazz Festival", "response": ["The 12th Bray Jazz Festival featured concert appearances by award-winning Brazilian players Hamilton de Holanda & Andr\u00e9 Mehmari, by celebrated American jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel Quartet, and by a host of other international and home grown acts including Christine Tobin & Liam Noble, The Artvark Saxophone Quartet, guitar prodigy Andreas Varady, Tcha Limberger's Kalotaseg Trio, and Snowboy and The Latin Section."]}, {"page": "Keb Darge", "response": ["In 1989, during the heyday of acid house in the UK, Keb decided to play these funk records, and managed for a short while to get a night to perform regularly at \"The Wagclub\", a club specializing in acid jazz.
