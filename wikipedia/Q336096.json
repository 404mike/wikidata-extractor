As attorney general, Bacon, by his zealous efforts\u2014which included torture\u2014to obtain the conviction of Edmund Peacham for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance; and successfully prosecuted Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, and his wife, Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset, for murder in 1616. The so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for Cambridge and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon Baron Verulam, of Verulam, in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam."]}, {"page": "July 17", "response": ["*1645 \u2013 Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, English-Scottish politician, Lord Chamberlain of the United Kingdom (b. 1587)"]}, {"page": "1645", "response": ["* July 17 \u2013 Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, Scottish politician (b. c. 1590)"]}, {"page": "Chiswick House", "response": ["The original Chiswick House was a Jacobean house owned by Sir Edward Wardour, and possibly built by his father.

The marriage was primarily a political union; they were separated after the wedding to prevent them from having intercourse, with the view that premature sex and pregnancy was to be avoided. Essex went on a European tour (from 1607 to 1609), and when he returned Frances made every effort to avoid him. He was at the time seriously ill with smallpox. She was at court and on 5 June 1610 danced as the \"Nymph of Lee\" representing the Essex River Lea in the masque Tethys' Festival.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities, of King James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1828), pp. 348\u201349. She had also fallen in love with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. When she finally took the step of annulment, unable to legally represent herself, her father and her uncle, Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, represented her and drew up the libel. The situation quickly attracted public attention, and was widely observed by those with \"prurient minds\". She claimed that she had made every attempt to be sexually compliant for her husband, and that, through no fault of her own, she was still a virgin. She was examined by ten matrons and two midwives who found her hymen intact. It was widely rumoured at the time that Sir Thomas Monson's daughter was a substitute, which is possible because she had requested to be veiled during the examination \"for modesty's sake\"."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Durham", "response": ["*Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset 4 February 1615 \u2013 20 November 1617"]}, {"page": "Catherine Howard, Countess of Suffolk", "response": ["* Frances Howard (1590\u20131632); married firstly Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex then Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset"]}]}}
