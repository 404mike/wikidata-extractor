Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced the total number of seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.May (1896), vol. I, pp. 422\u2013423."]}, {"page": "Bamber Gascoigne", "response": ["He is a direct descendant of the 18th-century Lord Mayor of London Sir Crisp Gascoyne and the Tory politicians Bamber Gascoyne (the elder) and Isaac Gascoyne.

Similarly, on 23 February 1807, George Hibbert gave a speech to the House of Commons defending slavery on the basis of the Old Testament and the Epistle to Philemon. Dumas notes that attempts to directly defend slavery on the basis of the Bible largely disappeared following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but its defenders still drew on religious arguments, such that the institution of slavery (allegedly) benefited slaves by encouraging them to convert to Christianity."]}, {"page": "54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot", "response": ["*1816\u20131841: Gen.

It was a boarding school located in Woolton Hall, outside Liverpool. Pupils there included Isaac Gascoyne and George Hibbert.

Initially involved as supporters of Booth's Liverpool school in 1765, they undertook housekeeping duties at the boarding school. Their money enabled Booth to purchase Woolton Hall, in 1771.

Mary continued to work as a milliner. The fact that he remained uncompensated continued to rankle. In December 1811 Bellingham returned to London, ostensibly to conduct business there, but in reality to resume his campaign for redress. He petitioned the Prince Regent before resuming his efforts with the Privy Council, the Home Office and the Treasury, only to receive the same polite refusals as before. He then sent a copy of his petition to every member of Parliament, again to no avail. On 23 March 1812, Bellingham wrote to the magistrates at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, arguing that the government had \"completely endeavoured to close the door of justice\", and asking the court to intervene. He received a perfunctory reply. After consulting his own MP, Isaac Gascoyne, Bellingham made a final attempt to present his case to the government. On 18 April, he met with a Treasury official, Mr Hill, to whom he said that if he could get no satisfaction, he would take justice into his own hands. Hill, not perceiving these words as a threat, told him he should take whatever action he deemed proper. On 20 April, Bellingham purchased two .50 calibre (12.7\u00a0mm) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. He also had a tailor sew an inside pocket to his coat."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Liverpool(two members)||Colonel Isaac Gascoyne||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Liverpool(two members)||Colonel Isaac Gascoyne||Tory"]}, {"page": "Gascoyne (surname)", "response": ["* Isaac Gascoyne (1763\u20131841), British Army officer and Tory politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["|Isaac Gascoyne"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Isaac Gascoyne||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| Isaac Gascoyne"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Isaac Gascoyne"]}, {"page": "Pryse Pryse", "response": ["Pryse was a supporter of parliamentary reform.
