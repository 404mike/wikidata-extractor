He was the manager of Hull City from 1905 until 1913. He was born in 6 South Street, Horncastle and played over 300 games for Sheffield Wednesday.\nLangley was a full-back who began his playing career with his local side Horncastle, moving to Football Alliance side Grimsby Town in 1889, and joining Middlesbrough Ironopolis in 1891, winning Northern League title medals in both seasons with the Teesside club.\nHe joined First Division Sheffield Wednesday in 1893 winning an FA Cup winners medal in 1896. They also won the Second Division title in 1900 and the Football League title in 1903 and 1904 while Langley was at the club.\nDespite suffering a rib injury that curtailed his career in the top flight, Langley was appointed as player-manager of Hull City in 1905. In his first season in charge, City finished in fifth place in the second division. In 1908\u201309 he led them to fourth place. In 1909\u201310 they finished third, and only missed out on promotion to the top flight on goal average, losing 3\u20130 to promotion rivals Oldham in their final game of the season, having won eleven and drawn one of their previous twelve games.Langley resigned from Hull City at the end of the 1912\u201313 season and later managed Huddersfield Town.\nHe died in Sheffield at the age of 66.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["During their first season in the top flight, former Leeds City manager Herbert Chapman was brought in (after Huddersfield helped him overturn his ban) as the new assistant to Ambrose Langley. Chapman replaced Langley in March 1921, and led the team to a 17th-place finish. In the summer of 1921, playmaker Clem Stephenson and the club's all-time top goal scorer George Brown were acquired. Chapman's tactics were based upon the principles of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers.Page (2006), p.\u00a0135 He is regarded as the first manager to successfully employ the counter-attack. Other progressive ideas included a disciplined fitness regime for the players, and the practice of reserve and youth teams playing the same style as the senior team. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network to find the right players for his tactical system."]}, {"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["The following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came close to promotion in the 1909\u201310 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.", "|align=\"left\"|Ambrose Langley||||April 1905 \u2013 April 1913 ||318||143||67||108||44.96"]}, {"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["Chapman was still working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off.Page, pp. 104\u2013105 Soon after, however, he was approached by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, who had been a former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were supposed to have been paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.Page, p. 111"]}]}}
