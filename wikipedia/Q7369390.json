Together, they wrote and recorded the song \"Barefoot and Tiptoe\" under the name The Sweetshop, erroneously believed to have been from A Teenage Opera. Wirtz and Hannaman divorced in 1969, at which time Wirtz teamed up with poetry writer Maria Feltham to record Wirtz's concept album, Philwit and Pegasus, for composer Les Reed's Chapter One label."]}, {"page": "A Teenage Opera", "response": ["Wirtz composed a range of material around this time, releasing it under a series of pseudonyms. Much of the music produced in late 1967 became part of the project and was released on the 1996 album. There were two particular recordings that did not survive, \"The Sad Story Of Simon And His Bugle\" and \"Two's Company, Three Thousand's A Crowd\". The latter was a musical comedy, with the voices of Tim Rice and Samantha Jones. In January 1968 Wirtz married Ross Hannaman and subsequently recorded many songs co-written with her. The track \"Barefoot and Tiptoe\" was one of their collaborations and featured her voice, as well as the Band of the Irish Guards. It was released as by The Sweetshop but sales were poor. Wirtz was forced to shelve the project and concentrated on Tomorrow, whose album was released in February 1968. However, many songs were released over the years that were intended for the project, for example Dream Dream Dream, performed by Wirtz but credited as Zion De Gallier. An album released in Germany in 1968 contained what was the basis for the Theme from a Teenage Opera.", "*Ross Hannaman"]}, {"page": "Andrew Lloyd Webber discography", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" |Ross Hannaman"]}, {"page": "Andrew Lloyd Webber: Now & Forever", "response": ["|Ross Hannaman", "|Ross Hannaman"]}]}}
