She primarily examined structural frameworks and the action within the limits allowed by those conditions. She combined realist ontology and called her methodology analytical dualism. Archer maintained that structure precedes agency in social structure reproduction and analytical importance, and that they should be analysed separately. She emphasised the importance of temporality in social analysis, dividing it into four stages: structural conditioning, social interaction, its immediate outcome and structural elaboration. Thus her analysis considered embedded \"structural conditions, emergent causal powers and properties, social interactions between agents, and subsequent structural changes or reproductions arising from the latter.\" Archer criticised structuration theory for denying time and place because of the inseparability between structure and agency."]}, {"page": "Social structure", "response": ["Other recent work by Margaret Archer (morphogenesis theory),Archer, Margaret S. 1995.

Equally, he rejects the collectivist notion, which he associated with Emile Durkheim, that reifies social groups and explains the social in terms of the influence of groups to the exclusion of the influence of persons. In fact, Durkheim does not reject psychology in toto. Durkheim spends two chapters of Suicide talking about psychological explanations of suicide.  Durkheim's real position is that *in addition to psychology* social facts play a role in explaining suicide rates  Instead, he argues that there is an iterative relation between people and society, which he understands as \"an ensemble of structures, practices and conventions\". People never create society from scratch because it always pre-exists them and provides the context in which they act, but it depends on human activity for its reproduction and/or transformation over time. Society, then, is a necessary condition of human action and influences it, but that human action is in turn a necessary condition of society, which it continually shapes and reshapes. Bhaskar initially saw the work of Anthony Giddens on duality of structure as consistent with the TMSA, but later accepted the critique of Giddens by Margaret Archer, who argued that Giddens conflated structure and agency. Archer's own concept of the morphogenetic cycle, developed independently, is remarkably similar to the TMSA, which led to the two working together under the banner of critical realism."]}, {"page": "Structure and agency", "response": ["A recent development in the debate is the critical realist structure/agency perspective embodied in Roy Bhaskar's transformational model of social action (TMSA) which he later expanded into his concept of four-planar social being. A major difference between Giddens' structuration theory and the TMSA is that the TMSA includes a temporal element (time). The TMSA has been further advocated and applied in other social science fields by additional authors, for example in economics by Tony Lawson and in sociology by Margaret Archer. In 2005, the Journal of Management Studies debated the merits of critical realism.", "The structure/agency debate continues to evolve, with contributions such as Nicos Mouzelis's Sociological Theory: What Went Wrong? and Margaret Archer's Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach continuing to push the ongoing development of structure/agency theory.  Work in information systems by Mutch (2010) has emphasized Archer's Realist Social Theory  as well as Robert Archer's application in the field of education policy. In entrepreneurship a discussion between Sarason et al. and Mole and Mole (2010) used Archer's theory to critique structuration by arguing that starting a new business organization needs to be understood in the context of social structure and agency. However, this depends upon one's view of structure, which differs between Giddens and Archer. Hence if strata in social reality have different ontologies, then they must be viewed as a dualism. Moreover, agents have causal power, and ultimate concerns which they try to fallibly put into practice. Mole and Mole propose entrepreneurship as the study of the interplay between the structures of a society and the agents within it."]}, {"page": "Cultural system", "response": ["Margaret Archer (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work Culture and Agency, argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski and later by Mary Douglas, is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by Antonio Gramsci through the theory of cultural hegemony through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)"]}, {"page": "Archer (surname)", "response": ["* Margaret Archer (born 1943), British sociologist"]}, {"page": "International Sociological Association", "response": ["# 1986\u20131990 Margaret Archer, UK"]}, {"page": "European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences", "response": ["The awardees are selected by a jury currently consisting of Margaret Archer, Allessandro Cavalli, Salvador Giner, Joachim Israel, Michel Maffesoli, Carlo Mongardini (chair), Birgitta Nedelmann, Helga Nowotny, and Piotr Sztompka.

Andrew Sayer has written accessible texts on critical realism in social science. Danermark et al. have also produced an accessible account. Margaret Archer is associated with this school, as is the ecosocialist writer Peter Dickens.", "The morphogenetic approach is a critical realist framework for analysing social change originally developed by Margaret Archer in her text Social Origins of Educational Systems and systematised in a trilogy of social theory texts, Culture and Agency (1988), Realist Social Theory (1995), and Being Human (2000). The approach was developed primarily as a critical realist response to the structure-agency problem in which \"we are simultaneously free and constrained and we also have some awareness of it\". At the centre of Archer's answer to this problem is 'analytical dualism', which entails an analytical separation of structure and agency so that the interaction between them can be studied and modelled by researchers. On this basis, Archer rejects alternative approaches that 'conflate' structure and agency into the single concept of 'practice', primarily directing her critique at Giddens' structuration theory. Archer extends the notion of analytical dualism to the distinction between \"the material and the ideational aspects of social life\", identifying 'culture' as a third fundamental aspect of society, alongside structure and agency. Therefore, the analysis of social change depends on modelling structure (S), agency (A), and culture (C), so that \"social life comes in a SAC \u2013 always and everywhere\". These concepts form the basis for the 'morphogenetic cycle', which splits social change into three processes: [T1] conditioning \u2192 [T2-T3] interaction \u2192 [T4] elaboration. ", "David Scott has written extensively about CR and education. In his book Education, Epistemology and Critical Realism (2010), he argues for a need to pay greater attention to the meta-theories which underpin educational research. An important issue for educational research, Scott argues, is the relationship between structure and agency. The work of Margaret Archer uses the morphogenetic cycle (explained in one of the sections above) as an analytical tool that allows the researcher to explore the interplay between structure and agency at any given moment in time. She uses analytical dualism, a methodological manoeuvre that helps, only for the sake of analysis, to separate structure from agency to explore their interplay at a particular moment in time."]}, {"page": "Detraditionalization", "response": ["* Contributors include Mark Poster, Richard Sennett, Ulrich Beck, Margaret Archer, Mary Douglas and Thomas Luckmann."]}, {"page": "Pierpaolo Donati", "response": ["To summarize.
