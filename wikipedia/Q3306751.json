Tynan scored both goals in the away leg against Carl Zeiss Jena of East Germany, the equalising goal being in the 90th minute but Newport lost the home leg 1\u20130. In total Tynan scored 66 goals in 183 matches during the most successful period in the club's history.In 1983, Tynan moved on to Plymouth Argyle where he became a cult figure during the 1980s and is frequently named by Argyle fans as one of the club's all-time greatest players. He was a member of the side which reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1984, scoring the goal which beat then top flight West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round of the competition. Argyle went on to beat Derby County in the quarter finals before losing to Watford in the penultimate stage of the competition.\nIn the 1984/85 season, Tynan was joint top scorer in all 4 divisions of the Football League with 31 goals, level with Tranmere's John Clayton. Clayton, ironically, joined Argyle as Tynan's replacement, when Tynan signed for Rotherham United in the summer of 1985. However, Tynan rejoined Argyle in early 1986, initially on loan, as the club pushed for promotion to the second tier. His excellent goalscoring record continued at that level and he became a club legend. In total Tynan scored 126 goals in 262 appearances for Plymouth. Former England manager Graham Taylor described him as one of the best natural finishers he had ever seen.Tynan spent a season as manager of Goole Town in the Northern Premier League between 1993 and 1994.As of January 2017 he was working as a taxi driver in Plymouth. He previously wrote a regular column about Argyle for local newspaper, the Plymouth Evening Herald. Tynan's biography was published in March 2009, entitled \"The Original Football Idol: The Tommy Tynan story\" by Ryan Danes (Breedon Books ISBN 978-1-85983-685-9). He was also the subject of the 1990 book Tommy: A Life at the Soccer Factory by Richard Cowdrey (Bud Books ISBN 9780951635001)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plymouth Argyle F.C.", "response": ["|1985|| Tommy Tynan", "|1987|| Tommy Tynan", "|1989|| Tommy Tynan"]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["His priority in summer 1978 was to find a target man for Tommy Tynan to play alongside and he found it in  Andrew McCulloch, who arrived from Brentford for a \u00a370,000 fee. He signed Terry Curran as a winger but eventually moved him up front to play alongside McCulloch. He sold goalkeeper Chris Turner to Sunderland and replaced him with the bigger Bob Bolder. He further raised the average height of the team by signing uncompromising centre-half Mick Pickering from Southampton. The team failed to advance in the league, finishing the 1978\u201379 season again in 14th spot.

The second round against SK Haugar of Norway was even more convincing: after a 0\u20130 draw away, the home leg was won 6\u20130, taking the club into the quarter-finals against Carl Zeiss Jena F.C. of East Germany. Aldridge was injured for both matches against Carl Zeiss Jena, though he was a non-playing substitute in the 2nd leg. The quarter-final away leg was drawn 2\u20132 with Tommy Tynan scoring both goals, including his equaliser in the 90th minute. However, despite dominating the home leg, Newport lost 1\u20130 in front of 18,000 fans at Somerton Park, denying them a high-profile semi-final with S.L. Benfica.

In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months.Bruce (1994), p. 62. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken.Bruce (1994), p. 65. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as \u00a3125,000 or \u00a3135,000.
