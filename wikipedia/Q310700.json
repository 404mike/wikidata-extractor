Everton signed McFadden for \u00a31.25 million in 2003. McFadden struggled to hold down a regular place in the Everton first-team and moved to Birmingham City for \u00a35 million in January 2008. A serious injury meant that McFadden missed most of the 2010\u201311 season and the Blues, who were relegated in his absence, decided not to renew his contract. McFadden signed again for the Toffees on a free transfer in October 2011, after regaining his fitness, and spent three months with Sunderland in 2012.\nTowards the end of his playing career, McFadden had two further spells at Motherwell, either side of a year at St Johnstone. During his third stint with Motherwell, McFadden also took on coaching duties. After a brief spell playing for Queen of the South, McFadden took a coaching position with the Scotland national team.\nMcFadden was first capped by Scotland in 2002. His goal in a Euro 2008 qualification match on 12 September 2007 against France in the Parc des Princes, which gave Scotland a 1\u20130 win, is regarded as one of the team's most famous goals. McFadden played 48 times for Scotland, scoring 15 goals, in total. He was appointed to an assistant coach position with the Scotland national team in March 2018.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 14", "response": ["*  1983   \u2013 James McFadden, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James McFadden (born 1983), footballer"]}, {"page": "Motherwell F.C.", "response": ["Despite the lack of resources, a number of young talented players were found to play for the club; crucially, when many of these moved on, including Stephen Pearson and James McFadden, they brought revenue in the form of transfer fees, and with John Boyle waiving the club's personal debt to him, its financial future was assured by the conclusion of the 2004\u201305 season with the club's yearly losses falling to one of the lowest figures in the Premier League\"Scottish Soccer Clubs Still In Debt\"  World Soccer, 18 January 2005 and the club coming out of administration in time to avoid a ten-point Premier League penalty which was being phased in for teams in administration.\"Motherwell plans still on course\" BBC Sport, 27 January 2004 On the field, the club also managed to reach the ", "*  James McFadden"]}, {"page": "Bishopbriggs", "response": ["Sports people include Alastair Kellock, Scotland cap, lock and captain of Rugby Union side Glasgow Warriors in the Celtic League who attended Bishopbriggs High School.
