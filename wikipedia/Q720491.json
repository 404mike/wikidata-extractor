It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation's largest marathons.  The 2000 running was second only to New York.Suozzo. pp. 19\u201321.  The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes.  The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.  By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons.  In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).  The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners.  The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen.  Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation.  At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if not the world.  Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison.Suozzo, p. 23. Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988 and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon.Suozzo, p. 24.  The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions.Suozzo, p. 25.  In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned.Suozzo, p. 28.  In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank.Suozzo, p. 29. In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon.Suozzo, p. 30.  In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty.Suozzo, p. 31.Suozzo, p. 90. In 1998, the race began using transponder timing.Suozzo, p. 33.  In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.", "World records have been broken at Chicago five times.  In 1984, Steve Jones broke the world record with 2:08:05.  In 1999, Khalid Khannouchi was the first to surpass 2:06:00 with 2:05:42. The women's record was broken in two consecutive years.  In 2001, Catherine Ndereba broke the record in 2:18:47, and Paula Radcliffe surpassed that mark with 2:17:18 the year after. In 2019, Brigid Kosgei won in a world record time of 2:14:04 which is now the women's course record."]}]}}
