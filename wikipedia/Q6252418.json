The melody is said to be a contrafactum of a popular border rant, \"Bonnie Annie.\" A different version, the one that endures today, was musically adapted in 1869 by William Metcalfe (1829\u20131909), the organist and choirmaster of Carlisle Cathedral.

John Peel was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953. In 1960, the battalion's designation was changed again when it was decided to introduce the Pentropic organisation into the Australian Army, a part of which required the reorganisation of the regionally based CMF battalions into six State based regiments.Grey 2008, pp. 227\u2013228.

The battalion received its World War II battle honours in 1961, and was entrusted with those earned by the 2/31st Battalion at the same time. In 1965, the Australian Army moved away from the Pentropic organisation and returned to the previous establishment and it was decided to return to the CMF battalions to their previous numerical designations.Grey 2008, p. 239.

The slow 6/8 march Squire Dacre's, often called Noble  Squire Dacre elsewhere, commemorates a local noble family; having 4 strains, rather than the two found in the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, it is the most elaborate version known, though similar to a three-strain version in Riddell's Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes, from Moffat, a little north of the Border. There is also an early version of John Peel, marked, unlike most tunes in the book,  'from memory'. As it is close in date to the tune's composition - Peel was still alive in 1840 - and somewhat different from the substantially reworked version published in 1866, this version is of interest. Rook also includes a Scottish tune, from which the song air was adapted: Where wad Bonnie Annie lie? Rook evidently regarded the tunes as distinct enough to include both. The fact that John Peel is marked \"from memory\", suggests that the other tunes were taken predominantly from printed or manuscript copies, which is corroborated by the closeness of some of them to known earlier versions."]}, {"page": "Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["Sir Frederick kept a pack of hounds at his Wythop Estate close to Armathwaite Hall.
