They drew against EFL League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers F.C.. The game started poorly for the Saints as Matty Stevens poked the ball past City goalkeeper Michael Johnson for the opening goal. St Albans however had a swift reply by scoring 2 goals scored by Mitchel Weiss and Zane Banton respectively which put the Saints 2-1 up. Just before the end of the first half, Jack Aitchinson scored with a right-footed shot from just inside the box to square the tie. With just over 10 minutes to go, Mitchel Weiss takes advantage of a Kane Wilson slip to square it to Shaun Jeffers who tapped it home into an open net. Then, with 2 minutes left to play, the ball squeezed through a St Albans player to send Matty Stevens through on goal but with a heroic tackle from Dave Diedhiou and a point-blank stop from goalkeeper Michael Johnson, the Saints kept their 3-2 advantage. With a blow of the full-time whistle by the referee, City had gone through to the second round. Most of the 4000 fans spewed onto the pitch to celebrate their victory."]}, {"page": "2000 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 March \u2013 Kane Wilson, footballer"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 West Bromwich Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2017 || RB ||  || Kane Wilson || Exeter City || 3 January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2017 || RB ||  || Kane Wilson || West Bromwich Albion || January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "Kyle Edwards (footballer, born 1998)", "response": ["On 31 August 2017, Edwards joined EFL League Two club Exeter City on loan until January 2018.
