He said the sacrifice she made was \"frightening to contemplate\" but she was determined to see him succeed as a cricketer. Yorkshire's coaching sessions were run by the former county batsman Benny Wilson, who was the first to show Laker how to spin the ball and encourage him to develop the skill.

His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on \"the match within the match\",Daniels, p. 53 with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: \"Do I add up the notes of a Mozart \"Vivace\" to evaluate the music?\"Cardus: Full Score, p. 101 To meet Cardus's requirements, the players were sometimes \"enlarged\", notably Emmott Robinson, the veteran Yorkshire all-rounder of the 1920s who through Cardus's pen became \"the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character\".Brookes, pp. 108\u201309 In the 1930s, Cardus's style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the England versus Australia Test series of 1930 Cardus described the Australian as \"an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him\u00a0... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us\".Brookes, pp. 126\u201327"]}, {"page": "Hedley Verity", "response": ["Rhodes and Emmott Robinson, the senior professionals in the Yorkshire team, discussed tactics with Verity and his friend and teammate Bill Bowes, to analyse their errors.

Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, averaging over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season. Rhodes, by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used.Thomson, p. 155\u20136. Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days, he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen.Hodgson, p. 113. He took over 100 wickets in 1922, 1923 and 1924, but took only 57 in 1925, a very good year for batting.Thomson, p. 160 As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period. He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers, directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding.Rogerson, p. 139. Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; for example, Arthur Lupton, captain from 1925 to 1927, \"very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson.\"Hill, p. 107. Stories emerged that he was an \"overmighty subject\", arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain.Rogerson, pp. 22\u20133. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, \"It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [the innings over].\"Ryder, p. 181.Hill, pp. 107\u20138. However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, although they agreed that he could be difficult.Rogerson, p. 23.  Beverley Lyon, who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934, criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.Rogerson, pp. 17\u20138."]}, {"page": "Bill Bowes", "response": ["Bowes made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Oxford University at The Parks 8 to 10 May 1929.

He joined a full Yorkshire team that included the all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe. It also included Emmott Robinson, the great character of Yorkshire cricket who was much eulogised by Neville Cardus, and Robinson willingly became Bowes' mentor in his early Yorkshire career. Bowes took none for nineteen in the Essex first innings but did not bowl in the second as Rhodes, then aged 51, destroyed Essex with nine for 39 including one spell of seven wickets in 28 balls.

They added 126 in 75 minutes of which Bartlett scored 94. The bowlers were Bill Bowes, Hedley Verity, Frank Smailes, Emmott Robinson and Cyril Turner. He hit seven sixes (all off Verity) and nine fours. In two overs by Verity, Bartlett scored 062660 and 006606. The last six was his final scoring shot as he tried to hit Smailes over long off and was caught by Maurice Leyland \"with his heels on the boundary and left hand outstretched\".

With the bat, he failed to score a hundred for the first time since 1912, but still made 1,401 runs at 34.17 and including nine scores over fifty. This placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages, his contributions helping his team to retain the County Championship. He made a very effective start to the season, taking 27 wickets in the first four matches for just 157 runs,Pope, p. 34. including the best figures of his career, eight for 26 against Glamorgan, and six for 14 against Middlesex. Later that season against Surrey, he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling feats. Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two. After Emmott Robinson took a wicket, Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match-winning performance. He finished with bowling figures of six for 22 and took ten wickets in the match. He had been under the impression that Surrey had only needed seven runs (rather than the 27 they required) to win at the end, and his teammates remembered he was pale with effort and concentration. In the same season, Kilner was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's Cricket Ground, the most prestigious such fixture at the time, where he scored eight in his only innings and took three wickets.Pope, p. 35. Wisden commented that he seemed certain to be picked for the England Test match side shortly (there were no Tests played that summer). He took a step towards this when he was selected for a Test trial match, scoring 26 and 11 not out, but only bowling 18 overs in the match to take two wickets. He also made another appearance for the Players, this time at Scarborough. His performances in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Bowlers of the Year."]}, {"page": "Roses Match", "response": ["At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, a record 78,617 spectators paid to watch the match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being answered by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 as if to make amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself \"It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me.\" He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:\"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket.\" The operative words in that famous lamentation are, \"Ah don't know who it is.\" "]}, {"page": "John Daniell (sportsman)", "response": [":\u201cSo, at Bath, Yorkshire obstinately declined to score and pass Somersetshire\u2019s first innings\u2019 total. The time of the afternoon reached five minutes to six\u00a0\u2013 five minutes before close of play. Emmott Robinson was the obstructive force at one end of the wicket, in his broadest pads. Somersetshire in those days was one of the country\u2019s\u00a0\u2013 nay, the nation\u2019s\u00a0\u2013 great humorous assets. John Daniell was captain, and amongst his co-laughers and practical jokers were Robertson-Glasgow (of everlasting and affectionate memory) and M.D.Lyon. The grim intention of Yorkshire not to score and win on the first innings, this late summer day at Bath, was too much for the comic imagination of Daniell. With only time for the bowling of two overs, he claimed a new ball. Yorkshire would take the lead (first innings) if they scored eight more runs\u00a0\u2013 and lose precious percentage. Daniell gave the new ball to Robertson-Glasgow, perfect instrument in this gorgeous leg-pull of Yorkshire. He at once bowled four byes right down the leg-side, wide of Emmott\u2019s pads, right down to a bank of geraniums in front of the pavilion. Emmott was in high dudgeon, 'Ah\u2019m surprised at you, Dr Glasgow, usin\u2019 new ball that way'. And Robertson-Glasgow, who never missed a cue, retorted, \u2018That comment Emmott, coming from one who knows all, and more than all, of the uses and abuses of new ball manipulation, touches me sorely\u2019.

Generally, these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team, but Yorkshire's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership. Tactically, Yorkshire's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson.Rogerson, p. 150.Hill, p. 104. The captain's primary role was the enforcement of discipline: maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected. In the early 1920s, Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming \"social outcasts\", and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams. Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield. The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest. Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign, though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge. His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president, Lord Hawke, but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes.Hill, pp. 106\u20137."]}, {"page": "Emmott", "response": ["*Emmott Robinson (1883\u20131969), famous Yorkshire cricketer from 1919 to 1931"]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["Yorkshire had been hit by a double tragedy in recent years with the deaths of Alonzo Drake (illness) and Major Booth (killed in action during the war) and a rebuilding process was necessary.

As always in the era of Lord Hawke, now club president, the team captain was an amateur player and from 1919 to 1921 it was Cecil Burton who filled the role.

Sellers soon became one of Yorkshire's greatest captains.  Percy Holmes missed several matches and Sutcliffe sometimes opened with Wilf Barber who now became a first team regular, especially as Edgar Oldroyd had retired.

They won the title twelve times and their lowest placing was fifth. Captaincy was a factor and the issue of a professional captain arose in 1927. Before then, it was widely believed that, despite there being a nominal amateur captain, the arch-professional Wilfred Rhodes was the de facto captain aided by his lieutenant, the even archer-professional Emmott Robinson. The matter was never in doubt from 1933 when Brian Sellers was appointed; Yorkshire won six titles under his tenure and only Lord Hawke has been more successful.", "Yorkshire were strong in all departments. The mainstay of the team was their world-class opening batsman Herbert Sutcliffe, whose career spanned the whole inter-war period. He had two significant opening partners in Percy Holmes and the young Len Hutton. Maurice Leyland was another regular England batsman and Yorkshire could also rely on Wilf Barber, Arthur Mitchell and Edgar Oldroyd. Opposing batsmen always knew that they would face a formidable attack, not least the two all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes through the 1920s and his successor Hedley Verity in the thirties. Yorkshire also called upon England bowlers George Macaulay, Roy Kilner, Abe Waddington, Bill Bowes and Frank Smailes. The redoubtable Emmott Robinson was a good bowler too, as was his namesake Ellis Robinson (no relation) in the late 1930s. Yorkshire's main wicket-keepers were Arthur Dolphin, who had made his debut in 1905, and Arthur Wood; they both played for England."]}]}}
