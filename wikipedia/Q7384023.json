On his league debut in the opening game of the season against Dundee United, he was criticised when his pass back to his goalkeeper was intercepted by Ryan Dow who went on to score as Aberdeen lost 3\u20130. Taylor scored his first goal for the Dons in a 4\u20130 win against Livingston in the Scottish League Cup. Taylor began to find his form from then on in and scored his first league goal in a 3\u20130 win against Hamilton Academical.

Just a week after signing new contract, Taylor suffered a knee injury and had to be substituted in the 63rd minute during a 3\u20133 draw against Dundee. As a result, Taylor had a surgery on his knee and was out for two months. After making his return, coming as a substitute in a 4\u20130 loss against Celtic, Taylor scored his second goal in the next game, in a 2\u20131 win over Motherwell on 13 March 2015.

Taylor made 37 appearances in all competitions as Aberdeen finished second and qualified for European Football for the second season running.
