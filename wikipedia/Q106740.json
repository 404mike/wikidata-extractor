One of the books featuring Heyer's characters, Death in the Stocks, was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as Merely Murder. The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery,Devlin (1984), p. 371. and although it had a good cast, including Edward Fielding as Hannasyde, it closed after three nights.Hodge (1984), p. 43.", "Despite her popularity and success, Heyer was largely ignored by critics other than Dorothy L. Sayers, who reviewed An Unfinished Clue and Death in the Stocks for The Sunday Times. Although none of her novels was ever reviewed in a serious newspaper,Byatt (1975), p. 297. according to Duff Hart-Davis, \"the absence of long or serious reviews never worried her. What mattered was the fact that her stories sold in ever-increasing numbers\". Heyer was also overlooked by the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.
