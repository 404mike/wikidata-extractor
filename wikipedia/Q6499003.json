Since the 75th Anniversary Special revamp, The Beano has now gained Andy Fanton, from The Dandy and the original Beano artists that remain in the comic are David Sutherland, Laura Howell, Nigel Parkinson, Hunt Emerson and Barrie Appleby, as Barry Glennard and Dave Eastbury appear to have gone."]}, {"page": "Minnie the Minx", "response": ["Although Harrison has been the main artist throughout this time, when he has been unavailable to draw the strip the main ghost artist has been Laura Howell. Since 2009, occasional Jim Petrie reprints have been used, particularly during the postal strikes in autumn 2009.", "Laura Howell, the first woman to draw Minnie is the current artist, first appearing as Minnie's 65th Year in the comic approached. As of April 4th 2021, her work has appeared in 127 Beano issues."]}, {"page": "Little Plum", "response": ["From 2002 it has returned again under its original name, drawn by Hunt Emerson. The strip was finally dropped in 2006 when Hunt Emerson started drawing Ratz, though he has since appeared in BeanoMAX and in the 2009 Beano Annual. In Issue 3566, Little Plum returned to the comic once again, as reprints of Hunt Emerson's strips. However, all uses of the word \"um\" present when the strips originally appeared were removed in the reprinted versions. In autumn 2012, a new feature launched in the Beano called Funsize Funnies, each page of which features four single line strips. One of these is Little Plum, drawn by Laura Howell. Some episodes are written and drawn by Andy Fanton, an ex-Dandy artist. Little Plum now features in The Beano every week in new full page strips drawn by Hunt Emerson and written by Claire Bartlett."]}, {"page": "Tricky Dicky (Topper)", "response": ["The comic strip was a gag-a-day strip starring a young boy named Dicky, who plays practical jokes on people, but they usually managed to get the last laugh. From 1999 to 2000 he re-appeared as a 'Guest Star' in The Beano, again drawn by Dallas, running against The Three Bears, Inspector Horse and Jocky and Gordon Bennett to be voted into the comic by readers, though The Three Bears was the winner. The basic premise of the strip was expanded to include that Dicky's father now owned a joke shop, explaining where he got all these jokes from. In Issue #4 of BeanoMAX, Tricky Dicky makes a surprise guest one-off appearance with a new look trying to trick Ball Boy, but it doesn't work. Tricky Dicky also starred alongside Roger the Dodger in the Beano Summer Special 2003. Tricky Dicky reappeared in a new strip in The Beano in 2013, this time drawn by Laura Howell. This new strip was a reboot with Tricky Dicky's appearance being changed and the character being given the new first name of Gordon. In the new strip, he is a more heroic figure, as he only plays pranks on people who deserve it."]}, {"page": "Ivy the Terrible", "response": ["In the 2008 and 2009 Beano Annuals, her strip was drawn by Steve Horrocks, in the 2011 edition she was drawn by Dave Eastbury, the Ball Boy artist, and in the 2012 edition she was drawn by Laura Howell."]}, {"page": "Les Pretend", "response": ["Sherwood continued to draw the strip until his death in late 2003. The strip then disappeared from The Beano for a short while, as it was originally planned to retire the character. Eventually, though, it returned to the comic drawn by Trevor Metcalfe, who drew it for about a year between 2004 and 2005, though Steve Bright also drew a few episodes in early 2004. The strip again disappeared before returning a couple of years later, this time drawn by Laura Howell. This was a one off, and showed Les beating a real Dalek in a Dalek fancy dress competition, and appeared in Beano issue 3402 dated 13 October 2007 . A Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green strip by the same artist followed this up with everyone dressed as vegetables in another fancy dress competition. Les wasn't seen again for nearly a year after that strip until the comic started to run reprints of John Sherwood strips from the 1990s. Laura Howell also drew Les's strip for the 2010 and 2011 Beano Annuals. Sometime shortly before Mike Stirling became editor, Les Pretend was dropped.", "Les Pretend returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by Laura Howell once again.", "Les also appeared back into the Beano 2016 annual twice, drawn by Laura Howell. he dresses up as his mum and orders pizza, then Des starts to prefer Les for a mum than the actual mum so Les' mum dresses up as Les. Les also dresses up as a cat, which his Dad uses on his Elvis Presley website to attract more people."]}]}}
