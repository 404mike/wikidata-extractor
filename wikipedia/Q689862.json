His interests were not confined to taxonomy, but extended to Economic Botany, of which he was an enthusiastic proponent, and all the other activities of Kew. He managed a large number of changes in the Gardens, despite having to operate in the post-war austerity climate. Some of his greatest successes were in building, renovating, and extending glasshouses, being responsible for the new Rhododendron House in 1925\u201326, an improved Economic House in 1930 and the South African Succulent House in 1936.Kew History "]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["| David Prain||11 May 1905||11 July 1857 \u2013 16 March 1944"]}]}}
