Methven became synonymous with Derby County; he played for the club in three FA Cup Finals and managed the club for 16 years. In total Methven was on the books at the Baseball Ground for 31 years and represented the club, in one capacity or another, in over 1000 matches.\nMethven, though born in Ceres, Fife, first played senior football in Edinburgh, for Leith Athletic, Heart of Midlothian and St Bernard's. He joined a growing band of Scottish professionals in English football when he signed forms with Derby County at the end of the 1890-91 season.\nUnder Harry Newbould Derby endured a period of great frustration, never fulfilling what talent that team had and Methven was involved in all the matches that mattered. In total he played 511 games and (was one of three players who) appeared in each of the three unsuccessful FA Cup appearances for the Rams, before taking the reins as manager immediately following Harry Newbould's departure in 1906. He last played for the club (at the age of 38) on 2 February 1907, in an FA Cup Second Round tie against Lincoln City, which Derby won 1-0.\nMethven was unable to stop the slide into the Second Division during his first season with the club and only converted the club's wayward fortunes when he persuaded the 36-year-old Steve Bloomer to return home from Middlesbrough in 1910, helping Derby County back to the First Division as deserved champions in 1912. Methven finally left Derby in June 1922 having been in charge for 498 games (winning more than he lost) finally working for a local authority after a stint as a scout with Stoke City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ceres, Fife", "response": ["* Jimmy Methven, (1868-1953 ), Derby County FC player and manager"]}, {"page": "Steve Bloomer", "response": ["Derby County formed a baseball team in 1900 which Steve Bloomer played for in that season.

The club was formed in 1884 but didn't appoint a full-time manager until 1896; prior to this the team for each match was selected by committee, a common practice in the early days of professional football. This chronological list comprises all those who have held the position of manager of the first team since 1896. Each manager's entry includes his dates of tenure and the club's overall competitive record (in terms of matches won, drawn and lost), honours won and significant achievements while under his care. Caretaker managers are included, where known, as well as those who have been in permanent charge. Derby have had 26 full-time managers. The most successful of these is Brian Clough, who won the club's first ever Football League title and reached the semi-final of the European Cup. The club's longest-serving managers were Jimmy Methven and George Jobey, who managed the club for 16 years, with Jobey being in charge for a club-record 629 games.", "|align=left| Jimmy Methven"]}, {"page": "History of Derby County F.C.

Former Derby player Jimmy Methven, who was nearing the end of a career spent at right-back with The Rams, was appointed as Newbould's successor, but faced without a regular goal-scorer, found himself in the position of overseeing Derby's first ever relegation, as they finished 19th out of 20 in the 1906\u201307 First Division table.", "The return to League action, and First Division football, saw Jimmy Methven charged with re-invigorating an increasingly ageing squad \u2013 whilst the squad did include players like Jimmy Bagshaw and Jimmy Moore, good enough to be capped for England even in their 30s, and two future internationals in Alf Quantrill and George Thornewell, the majority of the Derby squad was not up to the standard required. Methven also had to contend with his deteriorating eyesight. Derby struggled throughout the season and managed to stay up by just two points, finishing 18th; largely thanks to a run which saw them collect 4 wins and a draw from their last 5 games.", "Ward's first season proved difficult and saw the club record just 1 win their first 15 games, before a run of just 4 defeats in 15 from late March until the end of the season saw the club finish 18th. Ward made the first of several key signings whilst he was at the club with the capture of inside forward Alan Durban for just \u00a310,000 from Cardiff City in July 1963, and gave an increased first team role to Ron Webster, who had been at the club as a youngster since Harry Storer's reign. Durban finished as top scorer, though he only hit 9 goals, as Derby improved slightly to record a finish of 13th in the 1963\u201364 Second Division. The season also saw Jack Parry hit his 100th league goal for the club, becoming only the 6th player to do so after Steve Bloomer, Jack Bowers, Harry Bedford, Sammy Crooks and Jackie Stamps, when he scored in a 3\u20130 home win over Swansea Town. The gradual improvement under Ward continued into the 1964\u201365 campaign, where Durban linked up well with new signing Eddie Thomas, signed for just \u00a33,500 from Swansea Town, as they both hit 22 league goals to help the Rams record a finish of 9th. The success of Thomas, who scored in each of his first 6 appearances for Derby to equal the club record, as later cited by Ward as counting against him \u2013 \"(Thomas) proved a marvellous bargain and after that I was expected to sign other players as cheaply.\"Derby County: The Complete Record (Breedon Books \u2013 2006), p. 118 The success of the Thomas/Durban partnership carried over into the 1965\u201366 season, where they both hit 17 goals, and the club climbed one place further to finish 8th, despite equalling the club's worst ever start to a league season by losing their first 4 games. The introduction of substitutions to English football saw Bobby Saxton become Derby County's first ever substitute player when he replaced Geoff Barrowcliffe after just 14 minutes of the opening day defeat by Southampton. Barrowcliffe went on to make his 500th appearance for the club when he started the 2\u20131 away defeat by Carlisle United on 7 September, only the fourth player to do so after Jimmy Methven, Steve Bloomer and his teammate Jack Parry."]}]}}
