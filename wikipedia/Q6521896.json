For eight seasons with Middlesex, starting in 1933, he was regarded as a batsman who bowled infrequently, and though he played regularly in 1934 and 1935, he was a fringe first eleven player for his remaining seasons with the county. In eight seasons, he made only just over 2000 runs and took 23 wickets. The eight seasons were divided by the Second World War, in which he was a prisoner of war in the Far East and worked on the Burma-Siam railway.But recruited by Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller on special registration in 1947 and converted to off-spin, Muncer proved both a reliable batsman and a penetrative bowler. In his first season with the Welsh county, he scored 689 runs and took 107 wickets, including nine for 97 in an innings against Surrey at Cardiff, which was more wickets in an innings than he had taken in a full season before.\nThe following year, 1948, Muncer's 159 wickets played a large part in winning the County Championship for Glamorgan for the first time, and he finished high up the national bowling averages. Against Essex at Brentwood, he took nine wickets for 62 runs in an innings and 15 for 161 in the match, and these remained the best innings and match figures of his career. He also took 15 wickets in the match against Sussex at Swansea.\nOver the next four seasons, Muncer took more than 100 wickets each year except in 1950, when Glamorgan set a record with nine matches that failed to be decided even on first innings because of the weather. And his batting continued to develop, with one century in every season from 1950 to 1953 and, in 1952, a tally of 1097 runs to go with 105 wickets for the all-rounder's double.\nIn 1953, his bowling was hampered by injury, and Jim McConnon became the county's main off-spin bowler. He retired after the 1954 season, in which he was awarded a benefit, having played eight seasons in all for Glamorgan.\nAfter his playing career ended he returned to Lord's and was head coach of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) from 1964 until he retired in 1978. In 1971 he was awarded a second benefit, jointly with Harry Sharp, former Middlesex batsman and then scorer, who was his assistant head coach at MCC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Sharp (cricketer)", "response": ["He joined Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1934 and made his 1st XI debut in 1946. He played in 162 first-class matches as a right-handed batsman before his retirement in 1955. He scored 6,141 runs at an average of 25.80, with 9 hundreds and 30 fifties. He took 59 catches and 50 wickets with his off-spin at an average of 32.56, with a personal best of 5/52. He was awarded his county cap in 1948. His best season was in 1953, when he scored 1,564 runs. He was awarded a joint benefit with Alec Thompson by Middlesex in 1955 and a joint testimonial by MCC with Len Muncer in 1971."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Glamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.Playfair, pp. 97\u201398.", "Tom Goddard had the best bowling analysis of the season when he took nine for 41 against Nottinghamshire at Bristol. His colleague Sam Cook was second-best with nine for 42 against Yorkshire, also at Bristol. Three other bowlers \u2014 Peter Smith, Len Muncer and Cliff Gladwin \u2014 took nine in an innings and there were twelve instances of eight in an innings, including three by Goddard. Goddard took fifteen wickets in a match three times but the best match analysis was sixteen for 215 by Peter Smith for Essex against Middlesex at Colchester. Arthur Wellard and Doug Wright took fifteen wickets in a match once apiece."]}, {"page": "1948 English cricket season", "response": [" || Len Muncer ||align=\"right\"| 7736 ||align=\"right\"| 381 ||align=\"right\"| 2748 ||align=\"right\"| 159 || 17.28", " || Len Muncer ||align=\"right\"| 7736 ||align=\"right\"| 381 ||align=\"right\"| 2748 ||align=\"right\"| 159 || 17.28"]}, {"page": "1952 English cricket season", "response": [" || Len Muncer ||align=\"right\"| 5174 ||align=\"right\"| 259 ||align=\"right\"| 1816 ||align=\"right\"| 105 || 17.29"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 6th || 230 ||  Willie Jones Len Muncer || v Worcestershire || Worcester || 1953"]}, {"page": "Rodney Ontong", "response": ["Ontong was born in Johannesburg, and originally came to the UK from South Africa to pursue a football career; he had trials with Chelsea in the early 1970s.
