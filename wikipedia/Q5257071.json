Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science, urging, for example, \"school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.\" The Magis Center for Reason and Faith was founded specifically to apply science in support of belief in a deity and the Christian religion.

Lindberg and Numbers point out that \"there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge Earth's sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\". Numbers gives the following as mistakes arising from conflict theory that have gained widespread currency: \"the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages\", \"the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science\", and \"the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of the natural sciences\".  Some Christian writers, notably Reijer Hooykaas and Stanley Jaki, have argued that Christianity was important, if not essential, for the rise of modern science.  Lindberg and Numbers, however, see this apologetical writing which lacks in careful historical study and overstates the case for such a connection."]}, {"page": "Faraday Institute for Science and Religion", "response": ["The Institute's Director is Keith Fox, and its Course Director is Sarah Perrett.
