However, the opposition proved stronger, including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, William Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, Napier Shaw (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre-owners. After many hearings, a parliamentary committee vote narrowly rejected the proposal in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. People in the U.S. demonstrated even more skepticim; Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee."]}, {"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** William Christie, astronomer (born 1845)"]}, {"page": "William Christie", "response": ["William Christie may refer to:", "* William Christie (Unitarian) (1748\u20131823), Scottish Unitarian writer", "* William Christie (dean of Moray, Ross and Caithness) (1816\u20131885), Scots Episcopal priest and first dean of the United Diocese", "* William Christie (Conservative politician) (1830\u20131913), British Member of Parliament for Lewes, 1874\u20131885", "* William Christie (astronomer) (1845\u20131922), British astronomer", "* William Christie (dean of Brechin) (fl. 1882\u20131931), Scots Episcopal priest and son of the above Dean of Moray", "* William Christie (Ulster politician) (1913\u20132008), British politician", "* William Christie (musician) (born 1944), American conductor and harpsichordist"]}, {"page": "William H.

However, in 1890 the Astronomer Royal William Christie was interested in employing the highly educated women that began graduating from English universities and he got round the regulation by paying women as supernumerary computers and not putting them on the permanent payroll. He employed four women, not as supernumerary computers but as second assistants who undertook both observations and computing. Among others he hired Everett, who became the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich when she began working in January 1890. At Greenwich, Everett was assigned to work in the Astrographic Department, contributing to the international Carte du Ciel project. In addition to her work as a computer, Everett was trained to use the Observatory's new astrographic telescope (installed in 1890) to take the photographs.  Everett's job also involved measuring the plates, calculating the co-ordinates of the stars, and reducing the data for the catalogue. During this time, Everett also made observations for the Transit Department with the Prime-Meridian-defining Airy Transit Circle."]}, {"page": "F.

He was the only candidate but his examination papers were judged excellent.Christie Papers RG07/134, Tuck to Christie, 8 October 1891; note dated 29 December 1891. He  began work at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on 11 January 1892, at the age of 15.

He must have continued his astronomical studies for, in November 1895, at the age of 19, he was the youngest person ever elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was proposed by Edward Walter Maunder, who was a senior member of staff at the Royal Observatory.
