She published various works on astronomy and navigation, founded an academy for the teaching of these subjects, and ran a warehouse focused on the distribution, production and repair of navigational instruments. Her Academy was highly regarded and recommended by the East India Company, Trinity House, and the Admiralty. In recognition of her work, she was awarded medals by the Kings of Prussia and the Kings of the Netherlands, and her rule for calculating latitude from altitudes was described as \"ingenious\". Taylor was one of the very few women working as a scientific instrument maker in London in the 19th century. Her \"Mariner's Calculator\", patented in 1834, was dismissed by the Admiralty.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
