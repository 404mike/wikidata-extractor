She published various works on astronomy and navigation, founded an academy for the teaching of these subjects, and ran a warehouse focused on the distribution, production and repair of navigational instruments. Her Academy was highly regarded and recommended by the East India Company, Trinity House, and the Admiralty. In recognition of her work, she was awarded medals by the Kings of Prussia and the Kings of the Netherlands, and her rule for calculating latitude from altitudes was described as \"ingenious\". Taylor was one of the very few women working as a scientific instrument maker in London in the 19th century. Her \"Mariner's Calculator\", patented in 1834, was dismissed by the Admiralty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1870 in science", "response": ["* January 25 \u2013 Janet Taylor (born 1804), English mathematician and navigational instrument maker."]}, {"page": "1804 in science", "response": ["* May 13 \u2013 Janet Taylor, n\u00e9e Jane Ann Ionn, English mathematician and navigational instrument maker (died 1870)"]}, {"page": "Women in science", "response": ["* in Britain, Mary Anning (paleontologist), Anna Atkins (botanist), Janet Taylor (astronomer)"]}, {"page": "1870 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 January \u2013 Janet Taylor, mathematician and navigational instrument maker (born 1804)"]}, {"page": "2002 United States elections", "response": ["*Salem, OregonJanet Taylor was elected Mayor of Salem to succeed outgoing Mayor Mike Swaim."]}]}}
