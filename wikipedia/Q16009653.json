As a cricketer, he was a middle-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Oxford University and Warwickshire between 1946 and 1951. He was captain of Warwickshire in 1948.\nMaudsley was born in Lostock Gralam, Cheshire, and educated at Malvern College and Birmingham University, then served in the Royal Army Service Corps during World War II. After the war he gained a B.C.L. degree at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1947, was immediately elected a Fellow, and taught there for nearly 20 years. He was Professor of Law at King's College, London, 1966\u201377 and at New York Law School 1977\u201381. He died at San Diego, California.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Warwickshire, let down by unreliable batting, were captained by attacking batsman Peter Cranmer. Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to Edgbaston. Their best players were Test spinner Eric Hollies and batsman Tom Dollery, who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers Victor Cannings and Charles Grove; and the New Zealand pace bowler Tom Pritchard. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when Cyril Goodway was unavailable. Playfair commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, Aubrey Hill, Jimmy Ord and Ken Taylor. Other players were Bill Fantham, John Hossell and Ron Maudsley.Playfair, pp. 108\u2013109. Warwickshire played eleven home matches at their Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham and two matches at the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry."]}, {"page": "Maudsley", "response": ["* Ron Maudsley (1918\u20131981), British law professor and cricketer"]}, {"page": "History of Brasenose College, Oxford", "response": ["Brasenose's reputation for law remained, under firstly Ron Maudsley\u00a0\u2013 a Tutorial Fellow in the Stallybrass mould\u00a0\u2013 and Roman and Civil law lecturer and tutor Barry Nicholas,  then Peter Birks, another Roman lawyer and sometime Regius Professor of Civil Law at All Souls, Harry Lawson, the first Professor of Comparative Law, and Sir Otto Kahn-Freund, an employment law specialist.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0388\u2013389.
