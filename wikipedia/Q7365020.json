M. Forster as its President, and Clement Attlee, Aneurin Bevan, Havelock Ellis, Aldous Huxley, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, and H. G. Wells among its vice-presidents.\nForster's funeral oration to Kidd was included in his collection of essays, Two Cheers for Democracy, and concludes with the description: \n\n[T]here was in our friend something of the Ancient Roman, the Tribune of the People, who contents that the Res Publica should be the possession of all [...] There is here something that suggests the grandeur and the sternness of certain heroes of the ancient world, and their strife for an individual liberty compatible with civic righteousness. May his example remain with us! May we continue the fight that is never done!\nKidd continued to administer the Council's affairs, despite serious illness, until his death in 1942.", "link_mentions": {}}}
