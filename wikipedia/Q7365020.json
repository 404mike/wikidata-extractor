M. Forster as its President, and Clement Attlee, Aneurin Bevan, Havelock Ellis, Aldous Huxley, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, and H. G. Wells among its vice-presidents.\nForster's funeral oration to Kidd was included in his collection of essays, Two Cheers for Democracy, and concludes with the description: \n\n[T]here was in our friend something of the Ancient Roman, the Tribune of the People, who contents that the Res Publica should be the possession of all [...] There is here something that suggests the grandeur and the sternness of certain heroes of the ancient world, and their strife for an individual liberty compatible with civic righteousness. May his example remain with us! May we continue the fight that is never done!\nKidd continued to administer the Council's affairs, despite serious illness, until his death in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liberty (advocacy group)", "response": ["Liberty, formerly, and still formally, called the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL),Liberty \u2013 Constitution and Rules  | As amended by the AGM 19 May 2007 is an advocacy group and membership organisation based in the United Kingdom, which challenges unjust laws, protects civil liberties and promotes human rights.
