He lent his translation skills to help negotiate the first land purchases from Maori in New Plymouth and Wellington and became a key figure in the establishment of the settlement of New Plymouth. He was described by Edward Jerningham Wakefield, son of New Zealand Company founder Edward Gibbon Wakefield, as short, stout and \"perfectly round all over\" and fond of relating \"wild adventures and hairbreadth 'scapes\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Zealand Company", "response": ["Wakefield arrived at Cook Strait on 16 August and spent several weeks exploring the bays and sounds at the north of the South Island.E.J.

Increasingly nervous settlers appealed to FitzRoy for military protection, while  \u0100ti Awa chiefs, including Wiremu K\u012bngi, who had signed a Taranaki sale deed with a company representative at Queen Charlotte Sound in November 1839, sent a petition to FitzRoy protesting that it was wrong for the Europeans to take lands, particularly at Waitara, which M\u0101ori had never sold.
