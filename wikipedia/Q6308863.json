He regularly attends a clinic where he requires heavy medication, here he also expresses his fury at Effy's manipulation of both Freddie and Cook. At the clinic, he meets Emily who is receiving counselling, and the two discuss their woes outside the clinic. She confides to him about her homosexuality, and he in turn confesses his desire to be normal, shocking her with the number of drugs he has been prescribed. He also expresses his fury that the friendship he had shared with Freddie and Cook has been destroyed the love triangle caused by Effy. At Emily's urging, he stands up to Freddie over his treatment of him, accidentally revealing Emily's homosexuality to her twin sister Katie in the process. He then confronts Effy about her role in destroying a friendship he prized so much and confesses his love for her. Effy, seeing the impact she has had on his life, is apologetic and suggests they become friends, and is hurt when he coldly refuses. When he goes to confront Cook, he accidentally discovers that he is continuing his affair with Pandora, though he does not reveal this to anyone else. Seeing that Cook is, like Freddie, indifferent to his own feelings, JJ explodes at him over it. Cook, moved by this, gives him a hug and invites him to buy drugs, which subsequently gets busted. Cook and JJ escape and Cook, desperate for drugs, takes JJ's new medication on JJ's suggestion. JJ, however, did this because he knew that the drug is designed to both calm someone down and make them more honest. As a result, at a party Cook settles into a relaxed state, which surprises the gang, and reveals his affair with Pandora, which Pandora's boyfriend Thomas overhears. Cook also reveals Effy loves Freddie. JJ leaves the party and finds a distraught Emily whom he allows her to stay at his place after her argument with Katie. She in turn offers to take his virginity which JJ nervously accepts, and the two have sex. The next morning he introduces Emily to his mother (portrayed by Juliet Cowan) who is relieved to see that her son finally made a good friend."]}, {"page": "Cuckoo (TV series)", "response": ["| Juliet Cowan"]}, {"page": "Utopia (British TV series)", "response": ["*Juliet Cowan as Bridget (series 2), a scientist colleague of Michael who notices discrepancies in government plans for the Russian flu vaccine."]}, {"page": "Hank Zipzer (TV series)", "response": ["| Juliet Cowan"]}, {"page": "List of Hank Zipzer episodes", "response": ["* Nick James, Jayden Jean-Paul Denis, Chloe Wong, Felicity Montagu, Juliet Cowan, and Madeline Holliday appear in all episodes.", "* Nick James, Juliet Cowan, Neil Fitzmaurice, and Madeline Holliday appear in all episodes."]}, {"page": "Together (2018 film)", "response": ["* Juliet Cowan as Sheila Porter"]}, {"page": "Killed by My Debt", "response": ["* Juliet Cowan as Tracey Rogers"]}, {"page": "Back to Life (TV series)", "response": ["*Juliet Cowan as Tina, local policewoman who was Miri\u2019s childhood enemy"]}, {"page": "The Power (TV series)", "response": ["* Juliet Cowan as Barbara Monke", "In late October 2019, Leslie Mann was cast as Margot Cleary-Lopez.
