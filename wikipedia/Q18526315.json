In 1897 her mother married a second time, to Colonel John Bourchier Stracey-Clitherow who in 1900 took up residence at Hotham Hall in East Riding, and later, after the death of his father in 1912, Boston Manor.  The Washington Post in 1907 states Troubridge 'is the only sister of young Lady Sybil Dudley who as an orphan was adopted by the Duke of Bedford'.  But in the same article also states Troubridge was 'orphaned at a tender age' which seems in conflict with other sources showing her mother died in 1919 when Troubridge was 52 years old.  Adding to confusion about Troubridge's early life, Baroness Franzisca von Hedeman states 'Rachel Gurney...was brought up by the Marchioness of Tavistock, now Adeline, Duchess of Bedford...Her sister, Laura Gurney, now Lady Trowbridge, who is much admired for her literary taste, was brought up by her Aunt, Lady Henry Somerset, well known in America.\"  In fact, Lady Henry Somerset was her mother's cousin rather than her aunt, and, Somerset's sister was  Adeline Marie Russell, Duchess of Bedford.  Whatever the exact circumstances of her childhood, Troubridge spent much of her youth in Somerset's house where the refined library atmosphere influenced her future as a writer. \u00a0  "]}, {"page": "Adeline Marie, Duchess of Bedford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adeline Marie Russell, Duchess of Bedford"]}]}}
