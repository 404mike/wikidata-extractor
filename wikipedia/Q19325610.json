In 1961, construction began on what was then known as The Post Office Tower, with Bedford as Chief Architect and G R Yeats, senior architect in charge. Completed in 1965, with a height of 177 metres (581 ft), it became London's tallest building.\nBorn in Yorkshire, and trained as an architect in the Midlands, Bedford joined the Ministry of Public Building and Works in 1936.  In 1951, he was appointed the Ministry's youngest ever Chief Architect.  Shortly after, Bedford had an important role in the design of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, for which he was subsequently made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.\nBedford retired in 1970 and lived abroad for some years before dying in 2001. As the architect responsible for one of London's most iconic buildings, Bedford achieved surprisingly little recognition in his lifetime, or afterwards,  his obituary in The New York Times describing him as; \"the British government's anonymous chief architect, whose works were visible to millions but whose name was scarcely known\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BT Tower", "response": ["The tower was designed by the architects of the Ministry of Public Building and Works: the chief architects were Eric Bedford and G. R. Yeats. Typical for its time, the building is concrete clad in glass. The narrow cylindrical shape was chosen because of the requirements of the communications aerials: the building will shift no more than  in wind speeds of up to 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). Initially, the first 16 floors were for technical equipment and power. Above that was a 35-metre section for the microwave aerials, and above that were six floors of suites, kitchens, technical equipment, a revolving restaurant, and finally a cantilevered steel lattice tower. To prevent heat build-up, the glass cladding was of a special tint. The construction cost was \u00a32.5 million."]}, {"page": "Marsham Towers", "response": ["By the early 1960s the increasing numbers of civil servants led to the commissioning of Eric Bedford  (1909\u20132001), chief architect for the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, to design a headquarters building for three separate ministries, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Building and Works. His design, published in 1963, placed three twenty-storey slab blocks parallel north to south on top of a three-storey podium slab raised on stilts. Each tower was 66 metres tall and had exposed concrete framing, being built in a new 'box-shell' system which mixed pre-cast concrete and on-site construction."]}, {"page": "British High Commission, Ottawa", "response": ["The current building was opened in 1964 and designed by Eric Bedford.

The residence was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens to resemble an English country manor, with the old chancery facing the street. By the 1950s, the old chancery was deemed too cramped, and the new chancery, designed by chief architect Eric Bedford was constructed from 1955 to 1961, with Queen Elizabeth II laying the foundation stone on 19 October 1957. Part of the old chancery was converted into staff quarters, and the rest is currently occupied by the offices of the British Council. The British government was the first nation to build an embassy in the area that would later become known as Embassy Row."]}, {"page": "List of British architects", "response": ["*Eric Bedford (1909\u20132001)"]}, {"page": "1953 Coronation Honours", "response": ["* Eric Bedford"]}, {"page": "Coronation Arches", "response": ["The arches were designed by Eric Bedford.
