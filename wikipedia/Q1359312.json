He was stationed at Peshawar during the Indian Mutiny and then fought at the Battle of Charasiab in October 1879 and at the Battle of Kandahar in September 1880 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. For his bravery during these two battles, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He went on to command a brigade during the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1886 and became commander of Quetta District in 1889 in which role he led operations in the Zhob Valley and in Balochistan. He was commander of the forces in Natal at the opening of the Second Boer War and fought at the Battle of Elandslaagte in October 1899. He commanded the garrison at the siege of Ladysmith: although instructed by General Sir Redvers Buller to surrender the garrison he responded \"I hold Ladysmith for the Queen\" and held out for another four months before being relieved in February 1900. He finished his career as Governor of Gibraltar and then as Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912", "response": ["* June 24 \u2013 Sir George White, British field marshal (b. 1835)"]}, {"page": "1835", "response": ["* July 6 \u2013 Sir George White, British field marshal (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Second Boer War", "response": ["Another Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee.

The resulting Battle of Elandslaagte was a clear-cut British tactical victory,Ash, The Boer War Atlas, p.29 but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire on the town with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against their  positions.Ash, The Boer War Atlas, p.33 The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured.

The Tugela River posed a natural boundary to the Boer Republics to the north. Sir George White had unwisely tried to defend a line on a broad front, that was easily outflanked.  The Boers had occupied British towns in the Cape and Natal.  When Redvers Buller's expedition arrived in Cape Town Harbour in December 1899, his 30,000 troops faced a well-organized guerilla kommando of 40,000 Boer farmers.
