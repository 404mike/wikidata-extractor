His only other appearance came two weeks later at home to Chelsea.

On 7 January 2009, Grounds rejoined Norwich, this time for two months. He spent much of this stint at Norwich playing in central defence while Jason Shackell was unavailable, and he made a further eleven appearances for them, scoring three goals, before returning to his parent club. He made no appearances in what remained of Middlesbrough's season, but was an unused substitute as their relegation to the Championship was confirmed.", "Southgate selected Grounds to start the opening match of the new season. The team kept four consecutive clean sheets, and he continued in the side for several weeks, either at left back or, after the sale of Robert Huth, at centre back. The Evening Gazette suggested that \"battling full-backs Tony McMahon and Jonathan Grounds, who both have some experience at this level and appear to have a more physical approach have been picked ahead of the more silky but at times suspect duo of Justin Hoyte and Andrew Taylor.\" He dropped to the bench before the last match in September, and played infrequently until late January, when an injury crisis caused Southgate's successor, Gordon Strachan, to bring him back into central defence. According to the Gazette, \"Grounds made numerous headed clearances and interceptions during the game and could hardly have done any more to push himself back into Strachan's thoughts.\" He stayed in the team for another month, and finished the season with 20 Championship appearances."]}]}}
