The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts that there is no such being as God', I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively...in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism?Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly by people who identify with the label 'atheist'. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the presumption of atheism had become  \"one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism.\" And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: \"The Presumption of Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position\". In recent debates, atheists often forward the Presumption of Atheism referring to atheism as the \"default position\" or has \"no burden of proof\" or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist."]}, {"page": "Sunday Sequence (BBC Radio Ulster)", "response": ["It is presented week-about by R\u00f3is\u00edn McAuley] and Audrey Carville.
