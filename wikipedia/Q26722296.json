He had been brought up in the expectation of becoming the heir of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1750-1842), of Stevenstone, who died childless and was his great-grandmother's nephew. However, Lord Rolle instead left his fortune to Hon. Mark Trefusis, who changed his name to Mark Rolle (d. 1907), the nephew of his second wife Louisa Trefusis, a daughter of Baron Clinton. He married in 1850 Elizabeth Anne Johnson, daughter of Rev. Peter Johnson.Moore-Stevens rebuilt Winscott in 1865, immediately following his inheritance. He served as a JP on the Quarter Sessions Court of Devon, and Winscott House was built with its own \"Magistrate's Room\" with a separate entrance. He was especially reactionary and old-fashioned and at the Mid-Summer sessions of 1882 had declared his object was \"to get rid of traction-engines altogether\". On the  abolition of the Quarter-Sessions in 1889 he was the only former JP to have been defeated by a non-magistrate in the elections for  councillors to the new replacement governing body of the Devon County Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North Devon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Moore-Stevens"]}, {"page": "John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle", "response": ["Rolle's second marriage also produced no children. It had been thought that his heir presumptive was his next-of-kin, Rev. John Moore-Stevens (1784\u20131865), Archdeacon of Exeter, younger brother of Thomas Moore-Stevens (1782\u20131832), JP, of Cross, Little Torrington, appointed by Lord Rolle in 1822 as vicar of Otterton, a manor adjoining Bicton purchased by Rolle's father Denys Rolle (died 1797). Rev. Moore-Stevens's grandmother was Christiana Maria Rolle (1710\u20131780), Lord Rolle's aunt, who had married Henry Stevens (1689\u20131748) of Cross. He married Anne Eleanor Roberts, daughter of Rev. William Roberts, fellow and vice-provost of Eton College. An inscribed white marble tablet exists to the memory of his wife and himself in Exeter Cathedral. His son was John Moore-Stevens (born 1818), JP, DL, MP for North Devon, High Sheriff of Devon 1870, who rebuilt Winscott House, Peters Marland, in 1865. Lord Rolle however had decided to appoint as his heir Louisa's younger nephew, the six-year-old Hon. Mark George Kerr Trefusis (1835\u20131907), the younger brother of Charles Trefusis (1834\u20131904) 20th Baron Clinton. Whether his marriage to Louisa had been by chance or dynastic design, in fact the Trefusis Barons Clinton would have had an excellent claim to be his closest kin and legal heirs. Thus Rolle had followed his family's ancient practice of keeping the estates \"in the family\". His will required his young heir to change his name to Rolle, which he duly performed, and to adopt the Rolle arms in lieu of those of Trefusis. However, his design to revive the Rolle family was ultimately unsuccessful as Mark Rolle produced only two daughters and no son, and the Rolle inheritance passed to his male heir, his nephew, Charles John Robert Trefusis (1863\u20131957), 21st Baron Clinton."]}, {"page": "John Curzon Moore-Stevens", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Moore-Stevens (MP)"]}]}}
