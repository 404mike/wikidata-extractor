In 1920 he joined West Ham United as understudy to Ted Hufton, making 70 appearances before moving to Blackburn Rovers. Following short spells at Burnley and Darlington, Hampson signed for Cardiff City but was again unable to hold down a regular place, due to the presence of Tom Farquharson, and left the side in 1929 moving into non-league football after making one appearance for Notts County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hampson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tommy Hampson (footballer) (1898\u2013?), English footballer", "*Tommy Hampson (1907\u20131965), British track and field athlete"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Tommy Hampson"]}, {"page": "Tom Farquharson", "response": ["Having established himself as first choice, Farquharson featured 51 times during the 1923\u201324 season, missed only three matches during the campaign, featuring in all six of the club's FA Cup and Welsh Cup ties. Cardiff finished second in the First Division, losing out on winning the league title to Huddersfield Town on goal average. In the following campaign, Farquharson helped the side reach their first FA Cup final where they suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Sheffield United. With the retirement of Kneeshaw, Farquharson saw off competition from Joe Hills and Tommy Hampson to continue his spell as first choice goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Hampson", "response": ["*Tommy Hampson (1907\u20131965) an English 800\u00a0m runner, Olympic champion 1932", "*Tommy Hampson (footballer), English football player"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["The return fixture against West Ham resulted in a 2\u20131 defeat soon after and Cardiff were dealt a further blow as Willie Davies made his final appearance of the season as he was ruled out indefinitely after contracting pleurisy and confined to a sanatorium. Cardiff's next fixture against Sheffield Wednesday was delayed for two days owing to heavy fog in the Yorkshire area. When the two teams did meet, Cardiff were beaten 3\u20130. The side's first win in more than a month, a 1\u20130 victory over fellow strugglers Everton lifted the side above the relegation zone. Concerned about his team's faltering performances, Stewart made several more additions to his squad in December, adding goalkeeper Tommy Hampson from Darlington and forwards Fred Castle and Frank Matson from Mid Rhondda and Reading respectively. Matson made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 18 December and Castle against Newcastle a week later, but neither were able to stop the side falling to 1\u20130 and 5\u20130 defeats. Cardiff ended the calendar year with a 2\u20130 win over Arsenal following goals from Ferguson and Curtis. The match attracted the largest home crowd for a league fixture of the season with more than 25,000 in attendance."]}, {"page": "Walker Hampson", "response": ["Hampson was the brother of footballers Billy and Tommy Hampson.

Two other members of the team's 1927 FA Cup Final winning side, Tom Sloan and Tom Watson also departed the club. Both players had missed most of the previous season with injury and returned to their native Ireland with Linfield.
