In 1920 he joined West Ham United as understudy to Ted Hufton, making 70 appearances before moving to Blackburn Rovers. Following short spells at Burnley and Darlington, Hampson signed for Cardiff City but was again unable to hold down a regular place, due to the presence of Tom Farquharson, and left the side in 1929 moving into non-league football after making one appearance for Notts County.", "link_mentions": {}}}
