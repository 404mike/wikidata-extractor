She has been accused of manslaughter after poisoning one of her patients, but insists that she is innocent, and has a grudge against conventional medicine, insisting that everyone should see that herbal remedies are the true cure. Her haughty attitude soon gets Bea's back up, but most of the other prisoners take a liking her, annoying Bea even more. When an under-the-weather Doreen asks Evelyn for a remedy, she falls ill, leading Bea to believe that Evelyn has poisoned her; but Evelyn finds that Doreen has mistakenly heated the remedy first, which has resulted in Doreen falling sick. Soon after, a mysterious bug breaks out in the prison; it is assumed to be a tropical disease brought in by Jenny Armstrong, who had just returned from overseas. As many prisoners and officers fall dangerously ill and Wentworth is quarantined, Evelyn insists that her herbal remedies could find a cure, as conventional doctors struggle to find the cause. The other prisoners even start to believe her, when one of her secretly brewed remedies begins to heal the very ill Meg; but it eventually emerges that Evelyn was behind the \"disease\", lacing people's food with enough special ingredients to cause them to fall sick, giving her the opportunity to \"heal them\" and prove herself. When the other women find out, Bea insists that they do not take action straight away, instead biding their time and making Evie nervous.
