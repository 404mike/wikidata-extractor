Created by writer Tony Warren, Coronation Street first broadcast on ITV on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters introduced in the show's third year, by order of first appearance.\nFor the majority of the first half of 1962, Coronation Street was caught up in the midst of a strike by the actors' union Equity, which began in November 1961 and meant members could not sign new contracts for the duration. As a result, the show was forced to rely on just fourteen regular cast members for five months, as those actors had previously signed year-long contracts, a rarity in television at the time. The strike caused regulars such as Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire), Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) and, later, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to disappear from screens and no new characters were introduced until the strike ended in April.Series producer Derek Granger departed the show in April, and was replaced by H.V. Kershaw in his first of eight separate stints in the role over the next ten years. With the strike over, most of the cast lost at the end of 1961 returned to their respective roles, and in July Kershaw introduced kind-hearted young builder Jerry Booth, played by Graham Haberfield. Jerry would become a major character for the next thirteen years until Haberfield's sudden death in 1975. August saw the Street's second birth as Christopher Hewitt was born to parents Concepta and Harry, and long-term recurring character Dave Smith made his first appearance in September.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coronation Street", "response": ["In March 1961, Coronation Street reached number 1 in the television ratings and remained there for the rest of the year. Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15\u00a0million) tuned into Corrie, and by 1964 the programme had over 20\u00a0million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36\u00a0million viewers.Little (1995). p. 35. In spite of rising popularity with viewers, Coronation Street was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a nostalgic fantasy. After the first episode in 1960, the Daily Mirror printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset\u00a0... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.\"Tinker. pp. 12\u201313. By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the 1950s. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) becoming addicted to drugs, Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) being in a storyline about homosexuality, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.Little.
