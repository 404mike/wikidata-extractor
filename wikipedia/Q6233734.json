Such a status would convey tax benefits and other advantages. The move followed the worldwide publicity that accompanied the 1965 publication of the Anderson Report, a highly condemnatory report into the practices and effects of Scientology in Victoria, Australia. As Sir John Foster later noted in a British official report on Scientology, prior to the publication of the Anderson Report little serious effort was made to present Scientology as a religion. Following the report, however, the leadership of the Church of Scientology made a concerted effort to present Scientology as having a religious character. Scientology was now described as \"an applied \"religious\" philosophy, processing as a \"religious\" technology, auditors as \"Scientology Ministers\", auditing as \"Confessionals\", and so on.\" In an HCO Executive Letter of 12 March 1966 the founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, informed Scientologists that a new corporate structure was being set up using the Church of Scientology of California as a vehicle. Scientology \"auditors\" would be presented as ministers of religion, as \"ministers have in many places special privileges including tax and housing allowances\" and \"Parliaments don't attack religions\".
