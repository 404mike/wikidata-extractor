He was born in Lewisham and died in New York. He appeared in 44 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled left arm slow medium pace. He scored 1,391 runs with a highest score of 134 not out and took 36 wickets with a best performance of four for 37.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Gilligan", "response": ["Following the war, Cambridge University suffered from a lack of quality bowling at the start of the 1919 cricket season. Consequently, Gilligan faced little competition for his place in the team and took 32 wickets at an average of under 27 in Cambridge matches, which critics considered a poor return. He made a bigger impression when, batting at number eleven in the order, he scored 101 against Sussex and shared a last-wicket partnership of 177 in 65 minutes with John Naumann. A few days later, Gilligan won his blue\u2014the awarding of the Cambridge \"colours\" to sportsmen\u2014by appearing in the University Match against Oxford. On the last day of the three-day match, he took five wickets for 16 runs in 57 deliveries to finish with bowling figures of six for 52 (six wickets taken for 52 runs conceded). According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, this was the best bowling performance in the University Match for many years, although Cambridge lost the match. Towards the end of the season, Gilligan played three first-class matches for Surrey and made a further appearance in a festival game, although he accomplished little with bat or ball. In all first-class games in 1919, he scored 231 runs at a batting average of 17.76 and took 35 wickets at 31.57. At the end of the season, he changed counties; his family connections in the area, and the presence of his brother Harold in the team, led him to register with Sussex.Lee, pp. 147\u201348."]}, {"page": "John Neumann (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Naumann (1893\u20131964), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Burchell (cricketer)", "response": ["Though he appeared once for the Second XI in 1907, Burchell's second and final first-class match came 14 years after his first, once again appearing against Cambridge University.
