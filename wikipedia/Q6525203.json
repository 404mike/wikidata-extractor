Following a series of promotions his appointment as Managing Director, in succession to Stanley Gillen, was announced in June 1967.   In May 1968, on the official retirement of Sir Patrick Hennessy, Crossland was elected to the Chairmanship.   After his Ford chairmanship, he acquired several subsequent directorships in the auto-sector.\nCrossland married in 1941 to Rhona Marjorie Griffin.   The marriage produced two recorded daughters. He was also married to Joan Brewer who was the sister of Beryl Gilliat married to the writer and film director Sidney Gilliat, and therefore related to Amanda Eliasch and Toby Brown.\nHe died in Great Wigborough, Essex on 5 August 1999 at the age of 85 and was buried in the churchyard of St Stephen.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brett Lunger", "response": ["He married Jo, the daughter of Sir Leonard Crossland, former chairman of Ford of Britain and an executive with Lotus in 1975.
