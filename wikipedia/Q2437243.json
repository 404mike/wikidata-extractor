The first half was tumultuous. The Frenchman seemed to be taking some unnecessary risks outside his penalty area, and his antics began to have consequences that allowed unneeded goals for opposing teams. He was at fault for two goals in a 3\u20132 home defeat by Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in October 2001. Ferguson said how \"eventually he will get caught out\" and it wouldn't happen again. But another couple of late errors against Arsenal in a 3\u20131 defeat at Highbury the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to Thierry Henry, one of which came from a mis-hit clearance. Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with Matthew Upson, he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee Peter Jones, however. There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez's decline, and critics such as the BBC's Phil McNulty urged him to be dropped. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with Derby County at Pride Park. Derby forward Malcolm Christie looked to have sealed his hat-trick, but referee Steve Dunn controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["A notable event in the 2005-06 season was the final Premier League game against Fulham, where 15 of the 16 squad members were from the local area (the exception being Malcolm Christie).

Whilst several players, such as Malcolm Christie, bought from Nuneaton Borough for \u00a350,000 and eventually registering 30 goals in 129 appearances for the club over 5 years, Richard Jackson and Paul Boertien (both of whom spent nearly a decade at the club), were successfully captured from lower league sides, Smith's previous golden touch in the transfer market had appeared to desert him, as players such as Bjorn Otto Bragstad, Con Blatsis, and Daniele Daino where bought and barely registered on the field, with safety only guaranteed on the penultimate day of the 2000\u201301 FA Premier League season; Malcolm Christie's goal the difference in a 1\u20130 win away to Manchester United. Despite the headline grabbing capture of Italian international Fabrizio Ravanelli from Lazio, who scored on his debut in a 2\u20131 win over Blackburn Rovers, Derby's first opening day win since beating Sunderland 5\u20130 at the start of the 1993\u201394 season, Derby only took five points from their opening seven games of the 2000\u201301 season and Smith left his position in early October 2001, rejecting the position of Director of Football. He was replaced by Colin Todd, who had been his assistant since November 2000. Todd's tenure was a disaster as he recorded the shortest ever reign of a Derby manager, lasting just 98 days before he was sacked. After selling Seth Johnson to Leeds United for a club record \u00a37m, Todd used the windfall to bring in Fran\u00e7ois Grenet for \u00a33m (who left after just 14 games to join Rennes for just \u00a3800,000), Luciano Zavagno and Pierre Ducrocq but results did not improve and he was removed from his position after an embarrassing 3\u20131 capitulation at home to Division Three Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup Third Round. Todd won just four of his fifteen league games in charge and recorded heavy defeat by Fulham (2\u20135), Manchester United (0\u20135), Middlesbrough (1\u20135) and West Ham United (0\u20134) but, as Gerald Mortimer stated, \"Derby could not have it both ways. Either they were wrong to appoint (Todd) or wrong to dismiss him... Pickering's Chairmanship was pointing the club towards disaster.\" Another former Rams hero. John Gregory, was Todd's replacement, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract and becoming Derby's third manager of an increasingly troubled campaign, and initial seemed to have the force of personality to keep the Rams up. At one stage touted as a future England manager, Gregory had been in place at Aston Villa but his relationship with Villa chairman Doug Ellis led him to walk out to take charge at Derby. Gregory immediately bought in Newcastle pair Warren Barton and Rob Lee, and recorded three wins and a creditable 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United in his first seven games. The third of these wins, 3\u20131 away to Bolton Wanderers looked like pointing towards survival, but it proved to be Derby's last win of the season as they proceeded to lose their next seven games on the trot, the sixth of which, 0\u20132 at Liverpool, confirmed relegation after a 6-year stay in the top flight. The season ended with a 1\u20131 draw at Sunderland which took the club to 30 points, their lowest return for 11 years, and 19th place.", "Derby had budgeted for a fourth bottom finish (i.e. survival) in the Premier League and when this was not achieved the club was once again plunged into financial crisis. In an attempt to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking the club rejected offers for their better players over the summer -such as Malcolm Christie, Mart Poom, Danny Higginbotham and Chris Riggott \u2013 and an opening day 3\u20130 win over Reading seemed to have justified the decision. However, this proved a false dawn and a 1\u20130 defeat away to Gillingham in the next game signalled what was to come as the club won just 10 of its opening 29 fixtures and suffered embarrassing cup exits to lower league teams Brentford (FA Cup) and Oldham Athletic (League Cup). Players weren't paid on time (resulting in Danny Higginbotham going on strike), with high earning players such as Georgi Kinkladze and Fabrizio Ravanelli underperforming, and the club was trading insolvent. Christie, Riggott, Higginbotham and Poom were eventually sold in the January 2002 Transfer window, netting considerably less than they would have if sold the previous summer, and joined players like Horacio Carbonari, Darryl Powell and Deon Burton in exiting the club (Burton leaving as the club's most capped ever player, with 42 appearances for Jamaica). With the club low on registered professionals, home grown youngsters were given a chance at first team level, with Lee Holmes (who became the youngest player in the club's history when he took the field against Grimsby aged 15 years and 268 days), Lee Grant, Pablo Mills, Izale McLeod and Lee Camp all handed debuts throughout the course of the season. Although the club won its first game following the exodus 3\u20130 against Rotherham United they then embarked on 9 match winless streak which seriously threatened relegation. The eight match of this run was a 0\u20133 defeat by Nottingham Forest and Gregory was suspended the next day, the club alleging serious misconduct. Nothing specific was ever offered ad the next board had to pay Gregory a seven figure settlement. Gregory's replacement (initially on a short-term contract until the end of the season but then appointed full-time) was former Ipswich Town boss George Burley. His remit was simple: avoid relegation. A 2\u20131 win over Norwich City in Burley's first match got his reign off to the perfect start, and although only 6 points were taken from the next 6 games, it was enough to finish 18th in the league with 52 points, 6 clear of relegated Sheffield Wednesday in 22nd."]}, {"page": "List of English football transfers winter 2002\u201303", "response": ["The winter transfer window, which was introduced for the first time this season, was relatively quiet for the first 30 days, with 107 deals totalling \u00a317.54\u00a0million.
