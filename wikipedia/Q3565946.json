This was controversial, as both the King and Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, were Freemasons, as were many Anglican clerics. The Church of England Assembly discussed the subject in June 1951, although there was no substantive conclusion.Darkness Visible was published in 1952.  He later published Christian by Degrees, left England for Canada and became a Roman Catholic priest.\nHannah earned his M.A. from the University of Edinburgh in 1934. He died in Montreal in 1966.", "link_mentions": {}}}
