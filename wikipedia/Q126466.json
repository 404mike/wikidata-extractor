After 115 Premier League appearances with Sunderland, his contract expired and he controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United. After he was dropped from the 25-strong Premiership squad for the 2017\u20132018 season, he went on loan to Nottingham Forest for one and a half seasons.\nHe played once for the England under-20 football team in 2014, and was called up for the senior squad for the first time in August 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Keane", "response": ["On 23 April 2009, Keane was appointed as the new manager of Ipswich Town on a two-year contract, the day after the club had dismissed Jim Magilton.

The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2\u20131 win over Coventry City. In the 2009\u201310 season, Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper M\u00e1rton F\u00fcl\u00f6p, midfielders Carlos Edwards and Grant Leadbitter and brought in Jack Colback, David Healy and Daryl Murphy on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first 14 matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew far too many games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place. Many inconsistencies in the 2009\u201310 and the 2010\u201311 season meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions and as a result of a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship.
