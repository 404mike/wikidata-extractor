I was free to make another kind of music, not this mechanical music I had been trapped in.\" Hardy's music during the second half of the decade incorporated influences from the British Invasion pop phenomenon and \"a strong comeback of the traditional values of French chanson, neither y\u00e9-y\u00e9 nor 'Left Bank', but rather romantic.\"Quinonero, 2017, \"\u00abLa plus belle des fleurs de ton jardin\u00bb\" Released that year, Mon amie la rose showcased a growing complexity in her music, with stronger vocals and increased experimentation in song structure. Her most varied album yet, it incorporated influences of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique, as well as Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Her 1965 and 1966 output showcased a stylistic maturation, with productions that \"moved from the tinny sound of yeh-yeh pop into a fuller brand of rock arrangements.\" The overall sound of her follow-up L'amiti\u00e9 is considerably more expansive. According to Pitchfork's Hazel Cills: \"It wasn\u2019t until her fifth record La maison o\u00f9 j'ai grandi that Hardy grew into a more grown-up, baroque sound, one that matched the depth of her sorrow and its complexities.\" Likewise, Warfield considered that it was the album in which \"she really settles into her sound, giving us a glimpse of the performer we can still recognise as a 70-year-old\". With Ma jeunesse fout le camp, her last 1960s album recorded in London, she \"moved toward a more adult, sedate form of orchestrated pop balladry\". It has been described as \"her farewell to the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 years\"."]}, {"page": "Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)", "response": ["In early 1967, the changes paid off when Humperdinck's version of \"Release Me\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom and hit #4 on the US Billboard 100. Arranged by Charles Blackwell in an \"orchestral country music\" style, with Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page as session musicians and a full chorus joining Humperdinck on the third refrain, the record kept The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" from the top slot in the United Kingdom. The B-side of \"Release Me\", \"Ten Guitars\", continues to be enormously popular in New Zealand. \"Release Me\" spent 56 weeks in the Top 50 in a continuous chart run, and was believed to have sold 85,000 copies a day at the height of its popularity.
