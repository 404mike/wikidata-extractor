Charlton reached the FA Cup final in 2003 but lost 3\u20130 to Fulham. In the following season (2003\u201304) Charlton finished runners-up in the Premier League, just one point behind winners Arsenal, and again reached the F.A. Cup final which they lost to Arsenal. The season did bring success to the club, though, with a victory over Fulham in the final of the League Cup. In 2004\u201305, Charlton won both the Charity Shield (beating Arsenal) and the FA Cup (beating Everton) and once more finished runners up in the league to Arsenal. In 2005\u201306, Charlton regained the League Cup, beating Arsenal in the Final. However, in this season, and also the 2006\u201307 season, Charlton finished third in the league, meaning the club missed the opportunity to participate in the UEFA Cup. In May 2007, Charlton were again runners up in the FA Cup, losing to Arsenal in the final. During these successful years under manager Keith Boanas and assistant Matt Beard, the team included several current and former England internationals, notably club captain Casey Stoney, goalkeeper Pauline Cope, Joanne Broadhurst, Eniola Aluko and Katie Chapman.

It became evident that, in order to ensure the club's financial survival, a number of budget cuts would have to be enacted.

This decision was criticised by, among others, several of the club's players at the time, including Casey Stoney and Danielle Murphy. Charlton's chief executive, Peter Varney, defended the decision and pointed to the lack of exposure in the media and lack of funding given to the women's game from the Football Association as reasons for undertaking the decision."]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
