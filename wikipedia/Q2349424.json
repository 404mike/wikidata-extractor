In 1909 he represented Oxford in the annual match against Cambridge University winning in both the singles and doubles.As a cricketer he had first represented Berkshire in the Minor Counties Championship whilst still at school, and in 1907 he captained the Wellington first XI. He made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1911 and in the Varsity Match that summer scored a stylish second innings of 84, which helped to turn a close match decisively in Oxford's favour. The following year he also represented the Minor Counties against the South African tourists.Although he was never a particularly prominent rugby player either school or University, he caught the attention of the England selectors after a number of fine performances on the wing for Harlequin F.C. during the 1911-12 season, and marked his international debut with a try in an 8-0 victory over Wales at Twickenham in January 1912. He played in all four Tests in that season's Five Nations tournament scoring further tries against Ireland and France.On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he gained a commission in the Royal Artillery and was posted to France in 1915, eventually attaining the rank of Major. After being caught in a German gas attack in 1917 he was invalided out of active service. In 1918 he contracted tuberculosis whilst commanding a battery in Northern Ireland and never fully recovered his health. He died on 18 February 1923 at La Croix, France from the effects of phthisis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Brougham", "response": ["Henry Brougham may refer to:", "*Henry Brougham (divine) (1665\u20131696), English cleric", "*Henry Brougham (landowner) (1742\u20131810), landowner in north-west England", "*Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux (1778\u20131868), son of the above", "*Henry Brougham, 3rd Baron Brougham and Vaux (1836\u20131927), British noble and civil servant", "*Henry Brougham (sportsman) (1888\u20131923), British racquets, rugby and cricket player", "*Henry Brougham (priest) (died 1913), Dean of Lismore", "*Henry Brougham (fictional character), character in the 1947 film The Bishop's Wife"]}, {"page": "Brougham", "response": ["** Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux (1778\u20131868), British statesman", "* Henry Brougham (sportsman) (1888\u20131923), British rackets player"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left| Henry Brougham || Bye || Bye || Lost to Leaf  3-0"]}, {"page": "Henry J.
