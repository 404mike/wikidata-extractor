He was born at Greenock and worked as a clerk in Glasgow, but about 1820 adopted literature as his profession.\nRitchie wrote four novels, of which the most successful was Wearyfoot Common. The others were Schinderhannes, The Robber of the Rhine and The Magician. In his later years he edited Chambers' Journal. He also wrote short stories, including one of the first British werewolf short stories The Man-Wolf (1831). Ritchie also wrote non-fiction works, such as travel books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Werewolf fiction", "response": ["Nineteenth-century Gothic horror stories drew on previous folklore and legend to present the theme of the werewolf in a new fictional form. An early example is Hugues, the Wer-Wolf by Sutherland Menzies, published in 1838. In another, Wagner the Wehr-Wolf (1847) by G. W. M. Reynolds, we find the classic subject of a man who, although a kind-hearted man himself, accepts a deal with the devil to become a werewolf for 18 months accompanying Dr. Faustus and killing humans, in exchange for youth and wealth. \"The Man-Wolf\" (1831) by Leitch Ritchie yields the werewolf in an 11th-century setting, while Catherine Crowe penned what is believed to be the first werewolf short story by a woman: \"A Story of a Weir-Wolf\" (1846).Barger, Andrew; Shifters: The Best Werewolf Short Stories 1800-1849, 2010. p. 85;  Other werewolf stories of this period include The Wolf Leader (1857) by Alexandre Dumas and Hugues-le-Loup (1869) by Erckmann-Chatrian."]}, {"page": "Edward Jesse", "response": ["He also edited Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler, Gilbert White's Selborne, and Leitch Ritchie's Windsor Castle, and wrote a number of handbooks to places of interest, including Windsor and Hampton Court."]}, {"page": "Magician", "response": ["* The Magician, an 18th-century novel by Leitch Ritchie"]}, {"page": "Ritchie", "response": ["*Leitch Ritchie (1800\u20131865), Scottish novelist and journalist"]}, {"page": "Stockbridge, Edinburgh", "response": ["*Leitch Ritchie (1800-1865) lived on St Bernards Crescent"]}, {"page": "Names of the Holocaust", "response": ["The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of Louis VII of France, wrote that he \"once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church\", a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated. The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.John Milton quotesThe Oxford English Dictionary, Clarendon Press, 2nd ed. Oxford 1989, vol.

The journal was intended to be a weekly organ of the public-house interest, just as the Morning Advertiser was then its daily organ. In the first two or three years of its existence, its political stance was broadly Liberal. Its first editor, Leitch Ritchie, proved too liberal for his board of directors, and in addition to editorial clashes, the paper was a commercial failure. Ritchie was succeeded by Frederick Ledger, who became sole proprietor as well as editor. He edited the paper for more than thirty years, gradually changing its politics from Liberalism to moderate Conservatism. Politics, however, ceased to be a major concern of The Era. Its great features after it came into the hands of Ledger were sport, freemasonry and the theatre. A contemporary observer remarked, \"To the latter subject it has always devoted a very large part of its space. In relation indeed to the amount and accuracy of its theatrical intelligence, it far surpasses every other weekly journal.\"The Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals: 1800-1900 at 19th Century British Library Newspapers, Gale Group (requires subscription)"]}, {"page": "William Kennedy (poet)", "response": ["Kennedy left Paisley in 1828, and for a short time afterwards was probably a journalist in Kingston upon Hull, where he married his employer's daughter.
