He was the eldest son of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, by his wife, the heiress Lady Charlotte Boyle, suo jure Baroness Clifford, who brought in considerable money and estates to the Cavendish family. He was invited to join the Cabinet on three occasions, but declined each offer. He was Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and Governor of Cork, and Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. The 5th Duke is best known for his first wife Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. At the age of about twenty, Devonshire toured Italy with William Fitzherbert which is where they commissioned the pair of portraits by Pompeo Batoni.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1811", "response": ["* July 29 \u2013 William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire (b. 1748)"]}, {"page": "1748", "response": ["* December 14 \u2013 William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire (d. 1811)"]}, {"page": "Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington", "response": ["* Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle (27 October 1731 \u2013 8 December 1754).
