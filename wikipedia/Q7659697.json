He played club level rugby union (RU) for the sports club of the Leeds branch of National and Local Government Officers' Association (NALGO), and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain and England, and at club level for Leeds (Heritage \u2116 1000) (captain), as a centre, i.e. number 3 or 4, and coached at club level for Leeds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["Britain came from 0\u20134 behind to defeat Australia 11\u20134 at Headingley with Syd Hynes scoring the game's only try.", "|RC ||3|| Syd Hynes", "Having retained the Ashes, Great Britain were favourites to win the final, which would become known as the 'Battle of Headingley' due to its brutality. However it went completely against expectations as Britain failed to play any decent football despite overwhelming possession. The Kangaroos led 5\u20134 at half-time with a try to Australian three-quarter, Father John Cootes. They went on to utilise their meagre chances to the full, running out 12\u20137 victors. The game itself was an extended punch-up. The only surprise was that it took 79 minutes before anyone was sent off. Two sacrificial lambs, Billy Smith of Australia and Syd Hynes of Britain, were sent off the field in the last minute for what had been going unpunished throughout the game.", "*  Syd Hynes"]}, {"page": "Leeds Rhinos", "response": ["Coached by Derek \"Rocky\" Turner, Leeds returned to Wembley in 1971 and 1972 but lost out both times \u2013 in 1971 losing 24\u20137 to rank outsiders Leigh and suffering the indignity of captain Syd Hynes being the first man to 'take an early bath' at Wembley.

The Salford versus Leeds league match was abandoned after 38 minutes when Chris Sanderson of Leeds suffered a fatal injury. Leeds led 5\u20132, but the game was declared null and void and not replayed. The club recovered to win the Challenge Cup at the end of the season. This success was repeated in 1978, in a classic final against St Helens at Wembley Stadium with Leeds completing what was then a record comeback, from 10\u20130 down.

This was a match where Murphy's ability to attract controversy was once again exemplified. He was involved in an altercation with Leeds' Syd Hynes which resulted in Hynes being sent off for headbutting Murphy. Murphy was carried off the pitch on a stretcher, but later returned to the bench and was able to lift the trophy at the end of the game.  Over the years, tales of Murphy winking to his teammates as he was carried from the field have endured, and Hynes always maintained his innocence."]}, {"page": "Alan Smith (rugby league, born 1944)", "response": ["*Image \"Syd Hynes Looks For A Pass - Leeds' Syd Hynes looks to send Alan Smith away as Peter Small covers for Bradford. - Date: 22/10/1972\" at rlhp.co.uk"]}, {"page": "Bob Haigh", "response": ["Alongside fellow Leeds players, John Atkinson, Tony Fisher, Syd Hynes, Mick Shoebottom and Alan Smith, Bob Haigh was selected to play for Great Britain in the 1970 Rugby League World Cup in Great Britain."]}]}}
