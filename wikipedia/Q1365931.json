He gained his athletic training at Shrewsbury Technical College and went on to become a sportsmaster at Tiffin Boys' School in Surrey, England.He was known for his quarter-mile running races, with his first major race taking place during 1961.  He broke the British record for 440 yards as well as the European 400 metres record.\nDuring the Olympic Games held in Tokyo, he was captain of the men's British Olympic Team. Running the final stage in the men's 4 x 400 metres relay, he passed Wendell Mottley of Trinidad and Tobago to finish second to Henry Carr of the US. In the individual 400 metres he finished fourth.\nHis fianc\u00e9e at that time was Ann Packer who won a gold medal in the women's 800 metres (run) on the day after the men's individual 400 metres final.  After winning a silver medal in the 400 metres Packer had no plans to run in the 800 metres and had a shopping trip planned until Brightwell's disappointing 400 metres. She said she ran it for him and broke the world record in the process.The captaincy of the British Team and his silver medal was the climax of his career. Aged 24 years early in 1964 he announced that he would retire after the Olympic Games. He and Packer were each awarded the MBE in 1965.\nBrightwell and Packer were married on 19 December 1964 and had three sons: Gary, and two former Manchester City players Ian and David. Brightwell went into teaching before moving to lecture at the then Loughborough College and before taking up successive directorships with sports companies Adidas UK and Le Coq Sportif UK. He also ran a fishing tackle business for thirty years. He lives in Congleton, Cheshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Congleton", "response": ["* Ann Packer (born 1942) and Robbie Brightwell (born 1939), husband-and-wife Olympic Gold Medal athletes"]}, {"page": "Loughborough University", "response": ["*Robbie Brightwell \u2013 athlete, European 440 yards champion 1962"]}, {"page": "Leicester Forest East", "response": ["Leicester Forest East is a popular location among commuters and young families.

Large-scale housing developments took place in the 1960s, to the north-east and west of the M1 motorway. In the 1980s, a large housing project was constructed at the western edge of the settlement.

Disappointed, Packer planned to skip the 800m event and have a shopping trip instead, until her fianc\u00e9, Robbie Brightwell persuaded her to compete.
