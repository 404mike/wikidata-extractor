In the following 2004\u201305 season, Konstantopoulos finally made his d\u00e9but in the 2\u20131 League Cup win over Macclesfield Town on 24 August 2004. Konstantopoulos then made his league d\u00e9but in the 2\u20131 win against Colchester United six days later. Although still second-choice to Jim Provett at that point, he would become number one from the end of October, going on to make a total of 37 appearances that year. He was part of the Hartlepool United side that reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2005, and he kept 25 clean sheets during Hartlepool's 2005\u201306 campaign."]}, {"page": "Antony Sweeney", "response": ["Antony Sweeney was born in Stockton-on-Tees and grew up as a Liverpool fan and his favourite player was Robbie Fowler. After developing into a good footballer, he joined Hartlepool's Youth Development programme, the same programme that developed players such as Adam Boyd and Jim Provett into first team regulars. He established himself as a hot prospect whilst in the youth team and was offered a permanent contract under Chris Turner to stop him going elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Michael Nelson (footballer)", "response": ["The following season, Nelson joined Hartlepool United on the same day that Neale Cooper was appointed manager for a fee of around \u00a370,000. Nelson was seen as natural replacement for Graeme Lee who had joined Sheffield Wednesday. Nelson started strongly for Hartlepool and scored the winner from 30 yards during his debut in Hartlepool's 4\u20133 win over Peterborough. This goal almost earned him another award as it was on the shortlist for Hartlepool's Goal of the Season. He was also voted September's Player of the Month on the official Hartlepool website. Nelson began to form a strong partnership with Chris Westwood and the pair played together for the majority of Hartlepool's games. Nelson went on to play in 40 of Hartlepool's league matches and played in both legs of Hartlepool's play-off semi-final match against Bristol City. Nelson was in contention for Hartlepool's Fans and Players' Player of the season but he missed out to Jim Provett on both occasions."]}, {"page": "Matty Robson", "response": ["Robson came through Hartlepool's youth development programme, following in the footsteps of Antony Sweeney, Jim Provett and Adam Boyd. While playing for the youth team, Robson gained the reputation of being a quick and pacey winger with a keen eye for set pieces. He won Hartlepool's Young Player of the Year Award for 2002\u201303. For the 2003\u201304 season, manager Neale Cooper promoted him to the first team in order to fill the team's \"problem position\" of left back."]}, {"page": "Anthony Williams (footballer)", "response": ["Williams joined Hartlepool United on a free transfer in June 2000 and started 131 league games in four seasons at Victoria Park, helping Hartlepool to the Division Three play-off semi-final in the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons, and to promotion in the 2002\u201303 season. He lost his place in the first-team to Jim Provett at the start of the 2003\u201304 season and had loan spells with Swansea City and Stockport County. At the end of the season, his contract was not renewed and he was released by Hartlepool."]}, {"page": "Cameron Belford", "response": ["On 3 May 2008, Belford made his debut as a 75th-minute substitute against Accrington Stanley at the Crown Ground replacing Jim Provett with Bury winning the game 2\u20130. In October 2009 Belford impressed many against Rotherham United when he came on after 27 minutes into the first half when first team goalkeeper Wayne Brown came off injured. He made a number of fine saves and denied Ian Sharps from scoring a late equalizer. He kept the score down to 2\u20131 to Bury."]}, {"page": "2005 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["|GK || 1 ||Jim Provett"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 25 July 2007 || GK || Jim Provett || Bury || Free || "]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| Jim Provett"]}]}}
