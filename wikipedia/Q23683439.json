He was a Carnegie Research Scholar and Fellow at Aberdeen. He joined the British Indian government to study pearl oyster fisheries in southern Burma in 1906 and then worked in East Africa with the Nyassa Company. In 1909 an Entomological Research Committee was formed to study ticks of economic importance in Africa. Simpson and Sheffield Airey Neave were appointed travelling entomologists and he collected mosquitoes, Tabanids, bed-bugs, fleas, lice and ticks in Nigeria in 1910 followed by visits to the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone. In 1919 Simpson joined the National Museum of Wales as Keeper of Zoology and in 1926 became Curator of the Public Museums of Liverpool. He then took up a position in Turkey to head the Department of Oceanography and Marine Biological Research. Travelling from Greece on the ship Kyrenia, he was found missing from his cabin, last seen on the morning of 10 November 1936 and presumed drowned.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Simpson", "response": ["* James Jenkins Simpson, British entomologist and marine biologist"]}, {"page": "Simpson (name)", "response": ["** James Jenkins Simpson (1881\u20131936), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "Sheffield Airey Neave", "response": ["Neave's first work was research into the problems related to the tsetse fly and the study of African animal life. He was part of the Geodetic Survey of Northern Rhodesia between 1904 and 1905. Between 1906 and 1908 he was part of the Katanga Sleeping Sickness Commission and then from 1909 to 1913 the Entomological Research Committee of Tropical Africa.

They passed their find to James Jenkins Simpson, a shell collector in Aberdeen, and he sent them on to the conchologist James Thomas Marshall. Marshall determined that the molluscs were new to science, and formally described them, naming the new species Myrina simpsoni. Apart from one specimen which was found inside a baulk of drifting pinewood, all specimens seen since then have been associated with the skeletons of  dead whales, making this mollusc the first known species with such a restrictive habitat requirement. The species has since been transferred to the genus Idas, making it Idas simpsoni."]}]}}
