Instead, Ariovistus accused the two of spying and arrested them. Troucillus was chained and subjected to at least psychological torture, but Mettius seems to have received better treatment, perhaps because he had a longstanding relationship (hospitium) with the Suebian.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.46 and 52. On the hospitium between Ariovistus and Mettius, see Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, Patronage in Ancient Society (Routledge, 1989), p. 140 online. The abuse of envoys was a violation of the ius gentium, the customary law of international relations,Daniel Peretz, \"The Roman Interpreter and His Diplomatic and Military Roles,\" Historia 55 (2006), p. 454. but it has been observed that Ariovistus's charge may not have been groundless.John H. Collins, \u201cCaesar as Political Propagandist,\u201d in Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt 1.1 (1972), p. 930 online: \"it is hard to avoid the feeling that if we had an independent report of the incident from the German side we should learn that the envoys' conduct was not quite so diplomatically correct as Caesar has represented it\"; also N.J.E.

For reasons that are unclear, the Roman Mettius seems to have received better treatment during his captivity than did the Celtic envoy.Andrew Wallace-Hadrill suggests that the preexisting guest-friend connection (hospitium) between Mettius and Ariovistus accounts for this preferential treatment; see Patronage in Ancient Society (Routledge, 1989), p. 140 online. The episode allows Caesar himself to display by contrast the aristocratic virtue of treating one's dependent friends well, which fosters obligations that enhance the important man's prestige.Steve Mason references the example of Caesar's friendship with Troucillus in Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary (Brill, 2001), p. 166, note 1718 online."]}, {"page": "List of masters of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge", "response": ["*2009 Andrew Wallace-Hadrill"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, OBE.
