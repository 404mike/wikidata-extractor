Thompson married Millicent Maud Garnaut on 19 January 1909 and initially farmed near Keith in southeast South Australia before a drought in 1914 led to their return to Port Adelaide.\nIn 1930 Thompson was elected President of the Carters and Drivers Union, (later the Transport Workers Union). His influence in the union movement led to his preselection as the Labor Party candidate for the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide at the 1930 South Australian election. After the institution of single-member electorates in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1938, Thompson successfully transferred to Semaphore, serving there until 1946.  He also served as president of the South Australian branch of the ALP from 1938 to 1940.\nIn 1946 Thompson resigned from state parliament to successfully run as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Hindmarsh, based on Port Adelaide, in the House of Representatives.  After most of the northern portion of Hindmarsh was transferred to the new seat of Port Adelaide ahead of the 1949 election, Thompson transferred there and won easily. Thompson retired from politics at the 1963 election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Division of Hindmarsh", "response": ["| Albert Thompson"]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1961\u20131963", "response": ["| Albert Thompson"]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1958\u20131961", "response": ["| Albert Thompson"]}, {"page": "Division of Port Adelaide", "response": ["| Albert Thompson"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Port Adelaide", "response": ["| rowspan=2|Albert Thompson"]}, {"page": "Albert Thompson", "response": ["Albert Thompson may refer to:", "*Albert Thompson (Australian politician) (1886\u20131973), Australian politician", "*Albert Thompson (Georgia politician), American politician and jurist ", "*Albert Thompson (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u20131956), English footballer", "*Albert Thompson (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u2013?), Welsh footballer", "*Albert Thompson (sport shooter) (born 1952), Irish sports shooter"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1944\u20131947", "response": ["|| Albert Thompson  || Labor || Semaphore || 1930\u20131946", ": Semaphore Labor MHA Albert Thompson resigned on 19 August 1946 in order to contest the federal seat of Hindmarsh at the 1946 federal election.
