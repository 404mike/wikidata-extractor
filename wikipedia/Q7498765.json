He was a best-selling editor of three gardening magazines, including Amateur Gardening, the only 19th-century gardening magazine still being published today. He wrote over a dozen books on gardening and several more on natural history and related subjects. He promoted town gardening, aquariums, bee-keeping, vegetarianism, water recycling, environmental conservation and the prevention of cruelty to animals and birds, all before they were taken up as 'causes' in the twentieth century. Most important of all, he taught and promoted amateur gardening, before it was acceptable among the gardening establishment, and helped to found the whole consumer industry in amateur gardening that we have today.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christchurch, Dorset", "response": ["James Clark (1825\u20131890), horticulturist and early genetic hybridist who specialised in breeding new potato varieties.

In response to the Great Famine of Ireland he developed the Magnum Bonum potato, which is widely acknowledged as the first disease resistant variety. Magnum Bonum was trialled by entrepreneurial horticulturalist Shirley Hibberd and subsequently sold to Sutton's Seeds, who introduced it in 1876.

Her first gardening job was with the Royal Parks, after which she set up independently as Jude the Gardener, partnering with Carol Laws, and finding clients by advertising in the Hampstead and Highgate Express. She became known for her superb plantsmanship and distinctive designs which reflected the personalities of her clients and the architectural settings of their gardens. She also designed rustic garden furniture and summer houses, influenced by the mid-Victorian garden writer Shirley Hibberd. Her team of twelve became her friends, taking spontaneous excursions to Sissinghurst and other notable English gardens and in 1985 she formed a new partnership with the town planner Larry Hansen."]}]}}
