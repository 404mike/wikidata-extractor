She left the paper suddenly in spring 1974 following a dispute over its editorship in the wake of the surprise departure of Alastair Burnet, who left to become editor of the Daily Express.\nGoldring then moved to the BBC and meantime also wrote a weekly column for the Investors Chronicle, edited at the time by Andreas Whittam Smith. In 1976 she became one of the main regular presenters of BBC Radio 4's Analysis series of analytical authored current-affairs documentaries. She developed it into a flagship programme, staying with it until 1987. She also made five series of television documentaries, the Goldring Audit, for Channel 4 screened from 1993 to 1998.\nIn the late 1960s, Mary Goldring was The Economist's aviation correspondent, a post in which she was highly critical of the development programme for the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic aircraft, on the basis of noise, pollution and above all what she predicted would be disastrous commercial economics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Analysis (radio programme)", "response": ["In 2000 Analysis won the Political Studies Association 50th Anniversary Award for Outstanding Broadcast Journalism.
