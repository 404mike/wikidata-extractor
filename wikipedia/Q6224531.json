He emphasized the role of representation in understanding the mind, stating, for instance that \"the primary goal of neurolinguistics can be simply stated: the discipline seeks to understand the form of representation of language in the human brain\" (1977 p.127). \nHe pioneered cognitive models of the understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Marshall (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John C.

She retained a life-long interest in the group of ex-servicemen whom she studied, extending her studies to consider the impact of brain injury on cognitive aging. Her research was characterized by an interest not just in group data but also in detailed investigation of single cases. One of these, known in the literature as GR, had a surprising problem with reading words, in that he made semantic errors; for instance, when presented with the word 'canary' he would say 'parrot' - a word related in meaning but quite different in pronunciation. This cognitive profile, known as deep dyslexia was to provide a fertile source of data for theories of reading, and led to a long-lasting collaboration with John C. Marshall."]}]}}
