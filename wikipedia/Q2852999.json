G. Wells", "response": ["Wells had affairs with a significant number of women. In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society. Amber had married the barrister G. R. Blanco White in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells's \"sordid intrigue\" with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910 and 1913, novelist Elizabeth von Arnim was one of his mistresses.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition (UK library card required): Arnim, Mary Annette [May] von Accessed 5 March 2014 In 1914, he had a son, Anthony West (1914\u20131987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. In 1920\u201321, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with  the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger.\"The Passionate Friends: H. G. Wells and Margaret Sanger\", at the Margaret Sanger Paper Project."]}, {"page": "R. K. Narayan", "response": ["Narayan's writing technique was unpretentious with a natural element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability to relate to the topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to confirm to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol."]}, {"page": "Rebecca West", "response": ["In September 1912, West accused the famously libertine writer H. G. Wells of being \"the Old Maid among novelists.\" This was part of a provocative review of his novel Marriage published in Freewoman, an obscure and short-lived feminist rag. The review attracted Wells's interest and an invitation to lunch at his home. The two writers became lovers in late 1913, despite Wells being both married and twenty-six years older than West.Ray, Gordon N. H.G. Wells & Rebecca West (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), pp. 1\u201332 Their 10-year relationship produced a son, Anthony West, born on 4 August 1914. Wells was behind her move to Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, where she lived between 1917 and 1919.Gibb, Lorna The Extraordinary Life of Rebecca West (Berkeley, CA: Counterpoint, 2014), pp. 66, 70 Their friendship lasted until Wells's death in 1946.", "West's relationship with her son, Anthony West, was not a happy one. The rancor between them came to a head when Anthony, himself a gifted writer, his father's biographer (H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life [1984]), and a novelist, published Heritage (1955), a fictionalized autobiography. West never forgave her son for depicting in Heritage the relationship between an illegitimate son and his two world-famous, unmarried parents, and for portraying the mother in unflattering terms. The depiction of West's alter ego in Heritage as a deceitful, unloving actress (West had trained as an actress in her youth) and poor caregiver so wounded West that she broke off relations with her son and threatened to sue any publisher who would bring out Heritage in England. She successfully suppressed an English edition of the novel, which was only published there after her death, in 1984. Although there were temporary rapprochements between her and Anthony, a state of alienation persisted between them, causing West grief until her dying hour. She fretted about her son's absence from her deathbed, but when asked whether he should be sent for, answered: \"perhaps not, if he hates me so much\"."]}, {"page": "Dream of the Red Chamber", "response": ["The stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz KuhnDer Traum Der Roten Kammer (Leipzig: Insel-verlag,  1932). was the basis of an abridged version, The Dream of the Red Chamber, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958,(New York: Pantheon: 1958, ). Available at Open Library (link). and a later French version. Bramwell Seaton Bonsall, completed a translation in the 1950s, Red Chamber Dream, a typescript of which is available on the web. Critic Anthony West wrote in The New Yorker in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese \"very much what The Brothers Karamazov is to Russian and Remembrance of Things Past is to French literature\" and \"it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.\" Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the \"greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature\", for it is \"profoundly humane\"."]}, {"page": "Nigel Dennis", "response": ["Dennis held jobs at the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, a censorship body; The New Republic, a progressive political journal; and Time. His job at Time returned him to Britain in 1950 (or 1949). Easing into novel writing, in 1949 he published his first acknowledged novel, Boys and Girls Come out to Play (A Sea Change in the USA), which won the Anglo-American novel award for that year (shared with Anthony West). It starts semi-autobiographically, with a depiction of a young man having an epileptic fit, a condition Dennis suffered from all his life. Later in 1955, Dennis published his most notable work, Cards of Identity, a witty psychological satire that gained cult acclaim.  The novel was converted into a play the following year. Members of the Identity Club gather at an English country house to listen to papers discussing interesting case histories of various identity problems. The novel details many of the problems England experienced in the late forties and early fifties.   His third novel, A House in Order also deals with the question of identity but it is more personal rather than social as it portrays how a prisoner keeps his mind in order during his imprisonment. Dennis's career involved a mixture of non-fiction, novel, criticism, and play-writing. His book reviews appeared in the Sunday Telegraph for twenty years, starting (with the newspaper itself) in 1961. He became a contributor to Encounter in 1963 and was eventually appointed its co-editor before terminating his relationship with the magazine in 1970."]}, {"page": "Floor Games", "response": ["During World War II, the toy soldiers that inspired Floor Games and Little Wars were confiscated by the police from Wells's son (by Rebecca West) Anthony West, on account of his pacifism.Michael Sherborne, H.G.
