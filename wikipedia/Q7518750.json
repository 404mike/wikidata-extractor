Hurst, and Faraneh Vargha-Khadem identified an autosomal dominant monogenic inheritance that is localized on a small region of chromosome 7 from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members. The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes. The locus was given the official name \"SPCH1\" (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of bacterial artificial chromosome clones. Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case, the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a translocation) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region."]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Simon Fisher (born 1970), British geneticist and neuroscientist", "*Simon Fisher-Becker, British actor"]}, {"page": "Crick Lecture", "response": ["* 2008 Simon Fisher on A molecular window into speech and language"]}, {"page": "KE family", "response": ["Neuroscientist and language expert at the Institute of Child Health Faraneh Vargha-Khadem began to investigate teaming up with University of Oxford and University of Reading linguists. In 1995 they found, contrary to Gopnik's hypothesis, from comparison of 13 affected and 8 normal individuals that the genetic disorder was a complex impairment of not only linguistic ability, but also intellectual and anatomical features, thereby disproving the \"grammar gene\" notion. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they found that some brain regions were underactive (compared to baseline levels) in the KE family members and that some were overactive, when compared to normal people. The underactive regions included motor neurons that control face and mouth regions. The areas that were overactive includes Broca's area, the speech centre. With Oxford geneticists Simon Fisher and Anthony Monaco, they identified the exact location of the gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31) in 1998. The chromosomal region (locus) was named SPCH1 (for speech-and-language-disorder-1), and it contains 70 genes. Using the known gene location of speech disorder from a boy, designated CS, of unrelated family, they discovered in 2001 that the main gene responsible for speech impairment in both KE family and CS was FOXP2, and that this gene plays a major role in the origin and development of language. Mutations in the genes result in speech and language problems."]}, {"page": "Myrna Gopnik", "response": ["Gopnik is generally credited with an important early evaluation of the KE family, and with making this family known to the wider scientific community.
