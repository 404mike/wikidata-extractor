The Deuchar family had been Jacobite sympathisers, but transferred their allegiance to the Hanoverian cause before 1745, when a prominent Jacobite, Lyon of Easter Ogil, carried off the great sword of Deuchar, although it was recovered after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, and in the possession of Alexander when he started his revival of the Scottish Knights Templar. The new Order started formally in 1805 when a charter was issued to Deuchar by the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland (previously the High Knight Templars of Ireland Lodge, Kilwinning Lodge, and itself operating under a charter from the Grand Master of Lodge Mother Kilwinning, in Ayrshire), under the title of the Edinburgh Encampment No. 31. It became the Grand Assembly of Knights Templar in Edinburgh.\nDeuchar's brother, David, who was serving in the 1st Regiment of Foot, The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment), joined with other officers of the Regiment. In 1809 Alexander began, with Major Mueller of the same regiment, to request authority from the Duke of Kent, Grand Master of the Order in England, for a charter for a new Grand Conclave.  The charter was granted, finally, on 19 June 1811, for the \"Grand Conclave of Knights of the Holy Temple and Sepulcher, and of St. John of Jerusalem, H.R.D.M. + K.D.S.H.\". David Deuchar served in the Peninsular War (1808\u201314) in the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Foot of The Royal Scots and during the campaign in Portugal took the altar cross from the Templar Church at the Castle of Tomar, which had been destroyed by the French, and presented the Cross at the inauguration of the Conclave. Somewhat controversially, Alexander Deuchar opened membership of the Conclave to  non-Masons, and issued charters to Encampments which were non-Masonic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scottish Knights Templar", "response": ["An extract from the 3rd Duke of Perth's original letter to Lord Ogilvy shortly after the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans, describes, in vivid detail, a secret ceremony at Holyrood in which the prince was elected Grand Master of the ancient chivalry of the Temple of Jerusalem on Tuesday 24 September 1745...\"page 104Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture By Marsha Keith Schuchard, p 767 \"According to the early eighteenth-century writers, Jacob de Lennep, Abbe de Buisson, and Dom Calvet, Dundee was wearing a Templar Cross, emblematic of his role as Grand Master of the Scottish Order of the Temple.\"New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry 1921 by Arthur Edward Waite  \"Viscount Dundee.- It remains to be said that there is one captivating story which, if we can take it as given, will carry back evidence of an ORDER OF THE TEMPLE to the year 1689 and to Scotland. It has been said that the well-known French Historian and theologian Dom Calmet has lent the authority of his name to three important statements: (1) That John Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, was Grand Master of the ORDER OF TEMPLARS in Scotland; (2) that when he fell at Killiecrankie on July 27, 1689 he wore the Grand Cross of the Order; {3) that this Cross was given to Calmet by his brother.  If this story be true we are brought at one into the presence of a Templar survival or restoration which owes nothing to the dream of realities of the Chevalier Ramsay, nothing to the passion for the High Grades of Masonry, and nothing \u2013 so far as can be told \u2013 to Masonry itself, whether Operative or Speculative. We know that evidence is wanting at every point for the alleged perpetuation of the old Templar Order in connection with Masonry and that the legends of such perpetuation bear all the traces of manufacture. They are of course long posterior to the tragedy of Killiecrankie, and it has been a common practice of masonic writers in the past to say that the hypothesis of survival was invented by Ramsay, who also manufactured Templar Grades.  Both statement are untrue as I have shewn elsewhere. It is very curious that such a legend should have arisen in connection with Masonry, and if it originated circa 1740 or later, there is no question that it was prompted by Ramsay's Oration, though the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR were not named therein. But if a Grand Cross of the Temple was actually and provably found on the body of Viscount Dundee, it is certain that the ORDER OF THE TEMPLE had survived or revived in 1689.\" p 223 \"Among legendary or mythical Grand Masters are \u2013 in Scotland Viscount Dundee, the Earls of Mar and Atholl, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, John Olivant of Bachilton and Alexander Deuchar.\"", "The modern revival of Templarism in Scotland starts with Alexander Deuchar.

In 1811 with a Charter from the Templar Grand Master in England, the Duke of Kent, Alexander Deuchar established the Grand Conclave of Knights of the Holy Temple and Sepulchre, and of St. John of Jerusalem.

He is said to have assumed the Office of Grand Master for life, notwithstanding the displeasure of his associates. The Conclave appears to have been moribund in 1830. In 1836 it was remodelled, vacating its Masonic position and admitting non-Masons to membership, including the Bishop of Aberdeen and the Duke of Leeds.\"", ":\"DEUCHAR CHARTERS.-So called from Alexander Deuchar, an engraver, who was the principal mover in the establishment of the Grand Conclave of Knight Templar in Scotland, and its first Grand Master in the early part of this century. Deuchar seems to have become acquainted with Knights Templarism, in consequence of communications he had with Fratres serving in the Shropshire Militia, who had been dubbed under a warrant emanating from Dublin. This corps was quartered in Edinburgh in 1798; and from the Fratres of this corps it is most probable that the first Grand Assembly of Knights Templar was opened in Edinburgh; this, however gave place to the Grand Assembly of High Knights Templar, working Under a charter No 31 from the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland, of which Deuchar was Grand Master.  But these Deuchar Charters were clearly extra-Masonic, as they authorised Encampments to install Knights Templar and Knights of St John of Jerusalem, on the one condition that that such Encampments should not hold any communion or intercourse with any Chapter or Encampment, or body assuming that name, holding meetings of Knights Templar, under a Master Mason's Charter This body, however, lost its authority, in consequence of having nothing over which to exercise it, about 1837.\" Previously only Royal Arch Masons in Good Standing were allowed to join. Only the Royal Grand Conclave was allowed to admit non-Masons and these men were never members of any Encampments, only of Grand Conclave.\" The modern non-Masonic Order Militi Templi Scotia claims descent from Alexander Deuchar who was a Freemason."]}, {"page": "Deuchar, Alexander", "response": ["#redirectAlexander Deuchar"]}, {"page": "Deuchar", "response": ["*Alexander Deuchar (1777\u20131844), Scottish seal engraver "]}]}}
