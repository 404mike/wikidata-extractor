She had copies of some of her aunt's unfinished works and, in 1850, remembering Austen's proposed plot, she wrote The Younger Sister, a completion of Jane Austen's The Watsons. In the next following thirteen years, she completed nine more novels.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Watsons", "response": ["Dissatisfaction that the fragment's promising beginning was not brought to fulfilment eventually resulted in attempts to finish the novel. Some of the earliest of these were authored by descendants of the Austen family itself. In 1850, Jane's niece Catherine Hubback adapted the plot into a three-volume novel under the title The Younger Sister. The initial chapters were based on Jane's fragmentary story, which was known to family members but had still not been published at the time. The writing, however, was not word for word from the manuscript and in the development of the story some names were changed and new characters and episodes introduced, as well as long moralising passages and a good deal of descriptive detail. The continuation is recognisably Victorian in its themes and attitudes to social class.Cheryl A.

In the opinion of Jane Austen's great-nephew, William Austen-Leigh (1843 -1921), his aunt may have become aware of the difficulty \"of having placed her heroine too low, in a position of poverty and obscurity\u2026and therefore, like a singer who has begun on too low a note, she discontinued the strain.\"William Austen-Leigh, Jane Austen - Her Life and Letters - A Family Record, Read Books Ltd, 2012", "Another family response followed five years later with the publication of The Watsons, by Jane Austen.

The aim, according to the book's introduction, had been to \"disentangle Jane's story from that of her niece\", although a dependence on The Younger Sister remained.Deborah Yaffe, The Watsons in Winter, 16 January 2014 Mrs Hubback's novel was quarried yet again in 1977 by David Hopkinson  (1914-2002), the husband of Diana Hubback - a niece of Edith Brown.Tamara Wagner, \"Rewriting Sentimental Plots: Sequels to Novels of Sensibility by Jane Austen and Another Lady\", in On Second Thought: Updating the Eighteenth-century Text, University of Delaware Press, 2007, p.219 This relationship was coyly concealed on publication under the title The Watsons by Jane Austen and Another. A postscript surveyed the history of the family continuations and criticised the Brown version which \"so greatly compressed the plot's development that it did less than justice to Jane's own work when all it yielded was so perfunctory a conclusion\".Corgi reprint, 1968, pp.230-5 Nevertheless, believing that Catherine Hubback had absorbed from family members \"an accurate picture of the author's intentions\", he too kept his version close to Catherine's original wording and incorporated all of Jane Austen's fragment at its start. What are curtailed are all the digressions that Mrs Hubback had added to give her novel context and the subplots that maintained its momentum."]}, {"page": "Sara Wheeler", "response": ["O My America!: Second Acts in a New World records the lives of women who travelled to America in the first half of the 19th century: Fanny Trollope, Fanny Kemble, Harriet Martineau, Rebecca Burlend, Isabella Bird, and Catherine Hubback, and the author's travels in pursuit of them."]}]}}
