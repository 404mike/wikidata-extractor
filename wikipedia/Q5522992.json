He specializes in the 800 metres. Warburton finished fourth in the 800m at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. He has represented Great Britain on numerous occasions. He was also a member of the Great Britain team at the London Olympics in 2012. He was selected as part of the Welsh squad for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, however he was suspended shortly before the start of the Games after he was charged with a violation of anti-doping rules. In January 2015 UK Anti-Doping accepted that his positive test was due to taking a contaminated supplement and that he had not knowingly cheated, and gave him a six-month suspension, which was covered by the time he had been suspended since the Commonwealth Games. He is the current Welsh record holder for the 800m.\nWarburton is now a Sports Massage Therapist in Whitchurch, Cardiff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005 European Athletics Indoor Championships", "response": ["|Dale GarlandDaniel CossinsRichard DavenportGareth Warburton||3:09.53 "]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["*400 m: Gareth Warburton", "*4 \u00d7 400 m relay: Gareth Warburton, Matt Elias, Rhys Williams, Dai Greene, Christian Malcolm"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 400 metres", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Gareth Warburton", "| align=\"left\" | Gareth Warburton"]}, {"page": "Wales at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Gareth Warburton"]}, {"page": "List of doping cases in athletics", "response": ["|Gareth Warburton"]}, {"page": "2011 European Team Championships", "response": ["|Gareth Warburton ||1:46.95  SB"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Gareth Warburton was initially not selected for the 800 metres, having failed to achieve the 'A' qualifying standard at the 2012 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, but was granted a place at the Games following an appeal.
