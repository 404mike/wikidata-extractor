Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the Equity trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; Stephen Mulhern notably performed on the Royal Variety Performance in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat, and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. Clinton Ford, for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with \"Old Shep\" just after completing his final summer season at Pwllheli. However, prior to this in 1957 Russ Hamilton recorded a number 2 hit in the UK \"We Will Make Love\" (held off the top spot by Elvis Presley and \"All Shook Up\"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song \"Rainbow\", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record \"We Will Make Love\" for the benefit of Butlins guests."]}, {"page": "2008 in music", "response": ["** Russ Hamilton, 78, British singer"]}, {"page": "1932 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 January \u2013 Russ Hamilton, singer (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "2008 in British television", "response": ["|Russ Hamilton"]}, {"page": "2008 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 October \u2013 Russ Hamilton, singer (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "Gonna Find Me a Bluebird", "response": ["*Russ Hamilton released a version of the song as a single in 1960, but it did not chart."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2008", "response": ["*Russ Hamilton, 76, British singer."]}, {"page": "Billboard year-end top 50 singles of 1957", "response": ["|41 || \"Rainbow\" ||Russ Hamilton"]}, {"page": "2008 in British music", "response": ["*11 October - Russ Hamilton, singer, 78"]}, {"page": "Drifting and Dreaming", "response": ["* Russ Hamilton, Kapp Records (1958) "]}, {"page": "I Found You", "response": ["*\"I Found You\", song by Russ Hamilton (singer), Joe Lubin\t1959"]}, {"page": "1932 in British music", "response": ["*19 January \u2013 Russ Hamilton, English singer-songwriter (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "Rainbow (Russ Hamilton song)", "response": ["\"Rainbow\" is a song written and performed by Russ Hamilton.
