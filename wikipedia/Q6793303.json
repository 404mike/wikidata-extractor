In 1971-73 the librarian and secretary to the trustees was Maurice Line. The library was incorporated by Royal Charter and maintained by annual grants from the Department of Education and Science, local authorities, university and special libraries, adult education bodies and public trusts. The library was the national centre for the inter-lending of books (other than fiction and students' textbooks) and periodicals to readers in all parts of the British Isles through the libraries to which they belonged. Inter-lending was also carried on to and from foreign libraries through their national centres. Other tasks it undertook were the establishment of a union catalogue of Slavonic books and periodicals in British libraries and the production of the British Union Catalogue of Periodicals.Whitaker's Almanack; 1972, p. 405 On the establishment of the British Library in 1973 the National Central Library was incorporated with it."]}]}}
