He won four caps for Wales and was part of the Welsh side that faced the touring South Africans in 1931.\nDavies was originally a rugby scrum-half and centre, before moving into the forward, and eventually settling as a flanker. He faced the South Africans twice during their 1931 tour of Britain, once with Wales and once with Swansea. In the Swansea game, Davies set up his team's only score when he snapped up a loose ball, that broke loose after a South African tackle. He punted the ball forward for Claude Davey to beat the covering Springbok players to collect it and score a try.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Davies", "response": ["*Will Davies (rugby) (fl. 1910s), rugby league footballer for Great Britain, Wales and Halifax", "*Will Davies (rugby union) (1906\u20131975), Wales international rugby union player", "*Will Davies (Hollyoaks), a character on Hollyoaks"]}, {"page": "Will Davies (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Will Davies (rugby union)"]}]}}
