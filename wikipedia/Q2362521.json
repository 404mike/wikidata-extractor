Prior to Holtzmann, most Catholic scholars held to the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew \u2192 Mark \u2192 Luke) and Protestant biblical critics favored the Griesbach hypothesis (Matthew \u2192 Luke \u2192 Mark). The Two-Source Hypothesis crossed the channel into England in the 1880s primarily due to the efforts of William Sanday, culminating in B.\u00a0H. Streeter's definitive statement of the case in 1924. Streeter further argued that additional sources, referred to as M and L, lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively.Burnett Hillman Streeter, The Four Gospels, a Study of Origins treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, & Dates, (1924)"]}]}}
