She trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.Her big TV break came in 1991 with the role of Joy, the intelligent, acid-tongued secretary and foil to her corporate-speak boss, in the Channel 4 comedy Drop The Dead Donkey. Other TV roles followed, including two episodes of Soldier, Soldier in 1996 and A Touch of Frost in 1997.\nWhen her father died in 2000, the producers of Ballykissangel asked whether she would join the cast. She had reservations over her ability to cope emotionally but took on the part of Avril Burke.\nIn 2001, she also appeared in an episode of Cold Feet and one of Pie in the Sky. In 2010 she appeared in \"Your Sudden Death Question\", S4:E3 of Lewis. In 2012 she appeared in an episode of police comedy Vexed.\nSince 2001, she has been pursuing parallel careers of scriptwriting and acting.In October 2013, she appeared in Sarah Rutherford's \"Adult Supervision\" at Park Theatre (London).In 2016, she appeared in \"Shut Up and Dance\", an episode of the anthology series Black Mirror.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 5", "response": ["*1966 \u2013 Susannah Doyle, English actress, director, and playwright"]}, {"page": "Drop the Dead Donkey", "response": ["* Joy Merryweather (Susannah Doyle) \u2013 Series Two to Six \u2013 Joy Merryweather is entirely wrongly named; she is in no way joyful or merry. She began in series 2 as a cynical and surly personal assistant; in later series, she becomes increasingly aggressive and vindictive. There are a few occasions throughout the series when she shows sensitivity, however. Her beauty and ease in getting on with everybody when she's not being vindictive towards them makes her a key member of the team, with a weird sort of popularity, tinged with apprehension, and participates in all their schemes, sweepstakes, etc. George often remarks that she is the most-efficient production assistant GlobeLink has ever had. Joy began as a background character, intended to feed topical gags; however her popularity with audiences was such that she took an increasingly prominent role and eventually had a number of storylines of her own. Perhaps the most significant of these in terms of character development was the Series 5 episode The Graveyard Shift, in which it is revealed that her father, (already established as an alcoholic, and, according to Joy, \"wanted to be Peter Stringfellow\") abandoned the family; her mother \"went from Valium addiction to nervous breakdown to attempted suicide,\" and all of her brothers and sisters were affected by psychological problems, (except, at least in her own mind, Joy herself); her brothers are named \"Jolly\" (who is in \"Wormwood Scrubs\") and \"Happy\", (who was \"released into the care of the doorway\"), and her sister's name is \"Merrily\" (who is \"in a detox centre\"). In the final series, Joy has much of her doodled artwork put on display as she looks set to find a new career \u2013 only to discover she is being conned by the man and apparent lover behind the exhibition, and gets revenge by tying him up and exhibiting him naked at one of her art exhibitions. Her best friend from childhood is a Buddhist. Joy's childhood nickname was \"Flopsy\", which she put an end to by force-feeding worms to the boys in question, an action she repeats when Dave and Damien decide to continue the practice."]}, {"page": "A Touch of Frost", "response": ["* Susannah Doyle as Liz Maud (1997)", "* Liz Maud (Susannah Doyle, 1997) is a high-flying, west end detective, looking to use her skills and tactics to work her way up the ranks and become detective inspector.
