In the early years of the 20th century he served as Admiral of Patrols, commanding four flotillas of destroyers.\nDe Robeck commanded the allied naval force in the Dardanelles during the First World War. His campaign to force the straits, launched on 18 March 1915, was nearly successful, as the Turkish land-based artillery almost ran out of ammunition. However, mines laid in the straits led to the loss of three allied battleships. The subsequent ground campaign, like the naval campaign, was ultimately a failure and the ground troops had to be taken off the Gallipoli peninsula by de Robeck on the night of 8 January 1916. He went on to become Commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet and then Commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.\nAfter the war de Robeck became Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and British High Commissioner to Turkey, and then Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1928", "response": ["** Sir John de Robeck, British admiral (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "1862", "response": ["* June 10 \u2013 John de Robeck, British admiral (d. 1928)"]}, {"page": "County Kildare", "response": ["* John de Robeck: admiral"]}, {"page": "Gallipoli campaign", "response": ["Frustrated by the mobility of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet's efforts.

The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from Triumph went ashore and disabled several light guns.
