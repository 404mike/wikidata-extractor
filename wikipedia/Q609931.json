He also had a recurring role as Colonel Danby in the long-running radio soap opera The Archers.Perhaps Shelley's single best-known role was as Winnie-the-Pooh in Children's Hour adaptations of A.A. Milne's stories; for many British people of the mid-20th century, his is the definitive voice of Pooh.\nOther roles for Children's Hour included Dr. Watson (opposite Carleton Hobbs as Holmes) in the 1952\u20131969 Sherlock Holmes radio series; Toad in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows; and the roles of The Magician and Captain Higgins in the specially written Toytown series.

In the 1973 BBC television series Jack the Ripper Shelley played Detective Constable Walter Dew.", "link_mentions": {}}}
