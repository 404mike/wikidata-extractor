He also had a recurring role as Colonel Danby in the long-running radio soap opera The Archers.Perhaps Shelley's single best-known role was as Winnie-the-Pooh in Children's Hour adaptations of A.A. Milne's stories; for many British people of the mid-20th century, his is the definitive voice of Pooh.\nOther roles for Children's Hour included Dr. Watson (opposite Carleton Hobbs as Holmes) in the 1952\u20131969 Sherlock Holmes radio series; Toad in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows; and the roles of The Magician and Captain Higgins in the specially written Toytown series.
