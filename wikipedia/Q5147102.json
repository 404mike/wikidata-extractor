Davis, was assigned to Major General Henry Heth's division of Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill's Third Corps.  Both Heth's division and Hill's corps were new organizations, having been created as part of Lee's reorganization following the death of Stonewall Jackson.  Pettigrew's Brigade was the strongest in Heth's division. Freshly uniformed and armed with rifles from state military depots, his regiments presented a fine military appearance during the march through Maryland and Pennsylvania. Some of his regimental officers were also members of the North Carolina planter \"aristocracy\", including Colonel Collett Leventhorpe leading the 11th North Carolina Infantry and twenty-one-year-old Harry Burgwyn at the head of the 26th North Carolina Regiment, the largest Confederate regiment at Gettysburg. Not having been in serious combat for nearly a year, his brigade mustered a strength over 2,500 officers and men.Busey & Martin, p. 286."]}, {"page": "Military leadership in the American Civil War", "response": ["*Collett Leventhorpe"]}, {"page": "Leventhorpe", "response": ["*Collett Leventhorpe (1815\u20131889), US brigadier-general"]}, {"page": "Collett (name)", "response": ["* Collett Leventhorpe (1815\u20131889), Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War"]}, {"page": "Arthur Borton (British Army officer)", "response": ["Confederate soldier Collett Leventhorpe was his kinsman.Collett Leventhorpe, the English Confederate: The Life of a Civil War General, 1815\u20131899, p. 26-7"]}, {"page": "Thomas Leventhorpe", "response": ["The American Civil War Confederate general Collett Leventhorpe was Leventhorpe's brother."]}, {"page": "34th North Carolina Infantry Regiment", "response": ["* Cole, J.
