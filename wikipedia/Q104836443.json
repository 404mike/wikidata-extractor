He remained at Shawfield for four years and was part of a team defeated in a final by Celtic for a second time, this time in the Glasgow Cup of 1920. Fleming signed for Albion Rovers in 1922, and after seemingly having retired two years later, he made another single appearance for a Renfrewshire-based club, this time third-tier Johnstone, in 1926.", "link_mentions": {}}}
