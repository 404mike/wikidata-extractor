It was suggested that existing highway connections between the Belgian and Dutch harbors and Frankfurt were adequate, and the proposed highway with its bridge would not present a shortcut and thus would not be economically advantageous. More importantly, perhaps, was the concern that the \"ungainly\" bridge would destroy a historical cultural section of major significance within the Mosel wine region that some of the finest and most historic vineyards in Germany. A potential change in the local ecosystem would affect the premier riesling areas of the Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Graacher Himmelreich and \u00dcrziger W\u00fcrzgarten.
