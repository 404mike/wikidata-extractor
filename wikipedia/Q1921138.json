He noted that each country has anti-Muslim political figures, citing Jean-Marie Le Pen in France; Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands; and Philippe van der Sande of Vlaams Blok, a Flemish nationalist party in Belgium. Sardar argued that Europe is \"post-colonial, but ambivalent.\" Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile anti-Muslim prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics at Dortmund University of Technology, told Sardar: \"I am afraid we have not learned from our history. My main fear is that what we did to Jews we may now do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims.\" Similar fears, as noted by Kenan Malik in his book From Fatwa to Jihad, had been previously expressed in the UK by Muslim philosopher Shabbir Akhtar in 1989, and Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission in 2000. In 2006 Salma Yaqoob, a Respect Party Councillor, claimed that Muslims in Britain were \"subject to attacks reminiscent of the gathering storm of anti-Semitism in the first decades of the last century.\".Malik, Kenan. From Fatwa to Jihad. Atlantic Books, London (2009): pp. 131\u201332. Malik, a senior visiting fellow in the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the University of Surrey, has described these claims of a brewing holocaust as \"hysterical to the point of delusion\"; whereas Jews in Hitler's Germany were given the official designation of Untermenschen, and were subject to escalating legislation which diminished and ultimately removed their rights as citizens, Malik noted that in cases where \"Muslims are singled out in Britain, it is often for privileged treatment\"  such as the 2005 legislation banning \"incitement to religious hatred\", the special funding Muslim organizations and bodies receive from local and national government, the special provisions made by workplaces, school and leisure centres for Muslims, and even suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, that sharia law should be introduced into Britain.Malik (2009): p. 132 The fact is, wrote Malik, that such well-respected public figures as Akhtar, Shadjareh and Yaqoob need \"a history lesson about the real Holocaust reveals how warped the Muslim grievance culture has become.\""]}, {"page": "Glossary of Islam", "response": ["* Ziauddin Sardar, Muhammad for Beginners, Icon Books, 1994, some fun, from very modern Sufi point of view."]}, {"page": "Ash'ari", "response": ["Ziauddin Sardar states that some of the greatest Muslim scientists of the Islamic Golden Age, such as Ibn al-Haytham and Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, who were pioneers of the scientific method, were themselves followers of the Ash\u02bfar\u012b school of Islamic theology.

Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses the style of the Western genre into a \"feudalistic ethos\". Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholays \"hysterical visual style\" and intermittent \"populist message\". Cultural critic and Islamic scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam).
