Born in Stockwell, Surrey, he attended Uppingham School from 1859-1862, and later studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1868 and his MA in 1873. He settled in Australia in 1873 and took up business in Melbourne. He married in 1881, and in 1900 returned to England and settled in the London district of Kensington. Hogg was a specialist of the spiders of Australia and New Zealand. He was a fellow and honorary treasurer of the Royal Society of Victoria, as well as a fellow of both the Zoological and Botanical Societies of London.  He bequeathed his collections to the Natural History Museum of London.The genus  Hoggicosa is named for the author.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Austracantha", "response": ["*Austracantha minax hermitis (Hogg, 1914) - Endemic to the Montebello Islands.

The genus name recalls Canterbury Province, the origin of the specimen. Other names for the genus have been Misgolas  and Arbanitis.World Spider Catalog. (2015). Cantuaria dendyi (Hogg 1901).
