In 1850, the worsening economic situation in Ireland led his family to emigrate to Canada, where he settled in Seymour Township, Ontario and began farming.  Unsatisfied as a farmer, he became a school teacher in 1856.  It was during this time that he developed a nearly obsessive interest in botany. Although his formal education was slight, his knowledge and dedication to field work became sufficiently advanced that he gained the notice and respect of several professional botanists.  By 1860 he was teaching school in Belleville, and had established correspondence with botanists such as Asa Gray, Sir William Jackson Hooker, George Lawson, and Louis-Ovide Brunet.  This allowed him in 1868 to secure a faculty position as a Professor of Botany and Geology at Albert College in Belleville.  His marriage on 1 January 1862 to Ellen Terrill of Brighton, Ontario was to lead to two sons and three daughters. His elder son James Melville Macoun was his lifelong assistant. His younger son William Terrill Macoun, became the Dominion Horticulturist for Canada."]}, {"page": "G.Lawson", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Lawson (botanist)"]}, {"page": "Equisetum scirpoides", "response": ["::Equisetum scirpoides (ssp.) minus (Lawson, Milde) - Smaller subspecies, grows up to about 15\u00a0cm.

The third catalog was entitled Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and  was annotated by George Lawson, a botanist who founded the Botanical Society of Canada. In 1867, the first series was reissued with a new title, Wild Flowers of British North America.

Among its founding members was Scottish-Canadian botanist George Lawson, who created the Society with the goal of establishing a botanical garden at Queen's College (now Queen's University), and publishing a catalogue of Canadian plants.", "The Society had five categories of membership; Honorary Members, Fellows, Lady Members, Annual Subscribers, and Corresponding Members. Several notable Honorary Members were admitted; including Asa Gray, Sir William Jackson Hooker, John Lindley, and John Torrey. Women were granted equal membership, and the Society's Annals  contain several references to the work of its female members. For example, Mrs. Lawson, the wife of George Lawson, published a paper on silkworm cultivation. She argued that silkworm cultivation could be a productive form of employment for women and girls, while the silkworm's primary food source, the White Mulberry (Morus alba), would be an attractive addition to the urban landscape. Another member, a Miss Gildersleeve, followed-up on Mrs. Lawson's research with her  own paper, 'Remarks on the silk obtained from lettuce-fed silkworms'.", "Despite ambitious beginnings, the Botanical Society of Canada was short-lived. In October 1863 George Lawson resigned from Queen\u2019s after clashing with Queen's College administration and at least one colleague. Lawson immediately left for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he had been appointed professor of chemistry and mineralogy at the Dalhousie College (now Dalhousie University). Since the Botanical Society of Canada had relied on Lawson's social and professional connections, it collapsed after his departure. In 1867, former members of the Botanical Society of Canada attempted to revive the Society; proposing new branches throughout the country."]}, {"page": "Apium \u00d7 longipedunculatum", "response": ["The hybrid was first discovered by George Lawson in July 1845 at Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland, and two voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of William Gardiner, Dundee. Following Gardiner's death in 1852 the specimens were transferred as part of a bequest to the British Museum, and shortly afterward (ca. 1854) loaned to German botanist Friedrich W. Schultz, who described them as a new variety of Helosciadium nodiflorum, var. longipedunculatum. The variety was later (1906) described in further detail by Harry J. Riddelsdell and Edumund G. Baker, who examined a number of specimens from the original Gullane locality, as well as additional specimens from Duddingston Loch, Edinburgh, Scotland. While Riddelsdell did not consider var. longipedunuclatum to be of hybrid origin,  during the course of the 20th century a number of eminent botanists (e.g. Werner Rothmaler, Clive Stace) suggested that it was the hybrid between A. repens and A. nodiflorum.
