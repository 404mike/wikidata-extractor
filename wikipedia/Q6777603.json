He was a piper, violinist, composer and producer. He was an innovator and his compositions crossed musical and cultural divides.

His parents separated when he was six and his mother moved back to Scotland, taking him with her.

For Move, the opening track, he sampled a recording of traditional singer Sheila Stewart performing the Moving On Song, Ewan MacColl\u2019s song about travellers; she was delighted that he was taking it to a new audience.
