He had previously been a government minister under Arthur Balfour, H. H. Asquith, and David Lloyd George.\nForster was born in Catford, Kent. He attended Eton College and New College, Oxford, and in his youth played first-class cricket \u2013 in later life he served a term as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Forster was elected to the House of Commons in 1892, representing the Conservative Party. He was a Junior Lord of the Treasury under Arthur Balfour from 1902 to 1905, and later Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1915 to 1919. Forster was raised to the peerage in 1919, and appointed Governor-General of Australia the following year. Unlike his predecessor, Ronald Munro Ferguson, he faced no constitutional challenges and had no influence on the political scene. Forster travelled widely while in office and was popular among the general public, mainly concerning himself with ceremonial duties. He retired to England at the end of his five-year term.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Governor-General of Australia", "response": ["In 1919, Prime Minister Billy Hughes sent a memorandum to the Colonial Office in which he requested \"a real and effective voice in the selection of the King's representative\". He further proposed that the Dominions be able to nominate their own candidates and that \"the field of selection should not exclude citizens of the Dominion itself\". The memorandum met with strong opposition within the Colonial Office and was dismissed by Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary; no response was given. The following year, as Ronald Munro Ferguson's term was about to expire, Hughes cabled the Colonial Office and asked that the appointment be made in accordance with the memorandum. To mollify Hughes, Milner offered him a choice between three candidates. After consulting his cabinet he chose Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster. In 1925, under Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, the same practice was followed for the appointment of Forster's successor Lord Stonehaven, with the Australian government publicly stating that his name \"had been submitted, with others, to the Commonwealth ministry, who had selected him\"."]}, {"page": "January 15", "response": ["*1936 \u2013 Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster, English cricketer and politician, 7th Governor-General of Australia (b. 1866)"]}, {"page": "Catford", "response": ["* Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster - Forster Park is named after him"]}, {"page": "Henry William Forster", "response": ["#REDIRECTHenry Forster, 1st Baron Forster"]}, {"page": "Henry Forster (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster (1866\u20131936) was a British politician in Australia."]}]}}
