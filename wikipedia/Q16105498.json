Six programmes aired as special episodes in the United States between May and August 1966 on NBC. British stars on the show included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Petula Clark, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles' publicist Tony Barrow said that after the band's first appearance on the show on 13 October 1963, Beatlemania took off in the UK. Their performance was watched by 15\u00a0million viewers. One national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles \u2013 and it stuck.Pawlowski, Gareth L.

Alan Boyd, producer of The Generation Game at the time, remembers that there were many proposals as to who should take over, with Bill Cotton having a brief discussion with his favoured choice Cilla Black, who would not consider the move; other names mentioned included Jimmy Tarbuck and Kenneth Williams.Cotton, Bill. Double Bill: Bill Cotton - 80 Years of Entertainment. Fourth Estate Ltd (2001). . Pages 97-99 However, he felt he did not want the new programme to be comparable to Forsyth's Generation Game (he did not want the audience to be able to compare the two shows to think that Bruce was better or that the new host was better), so he cast Larry Grayson to take over, with a new theme tune and scenery, and a new co-host, Isla St Clair. It worked, as The Big Night failed to beat The Generation Game and was off the air within three months.", "By the early 1980s The Generation Game was being beaten by ITV's hugely successful Game for a Laugh, which had been commissioned by LWT's Head of Light Entertainment Alan Boyd, who had been Grayson's producer for his first three seasons, but had defected to ITV. The show continued through to the end of 1981, but shortly after a highlights episode from the last series aired on 3 January 1982, Grayson decided to quit whilst the show was still popular. The BBC approached Jimmy Tarbuck to present the show but he turned it down. The show was later cancelled."]}, {"page": "Clodagh Rodgers", "response": ["Her stage career was damaged when she walked out on the show Meet Me in London at London's Adelphi Theatre in April 1971. The show, a fixed 10-week fill-in between the closure of the musical Charlie Girl and a new production of Show Boat, was produced by Harold Fielding, and consisted of two halves. Clodagh was due to feature in the opening half, mainly with the 30-strong singing and dancing group, The Young Generation, with two interspersed spots, one with comics Hope and Keen, the other some songs from Rodgers. The second half was a Tommy Steele-centred spectacular that had originally been played in Las Vegas. After cuts to the running order to trim the show's length, Rodgers and her manager/husband walked out 15 minutes before curtain-up on opening night. Hope and Keen filled in for her and after a few shows singer Susan Maughan took over her spot. Despite this, Rodgers continued with TV work through the late 1970s. As part of BBC1's celebration of the UK and Ireland both joining the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973, Clodagh appeared on Top Of The Year on 31 December 1972, alongside Bruce Forsyth and with Jimmy Tarbuck in The Tarbuck Follies on 1 January 1973 to see in the new year. Having been dropped by RCA in early 1974, Clodagh released just one single for the Pye label, \"Saturday Sunday\" later that year. She signed to Polydor Records in 1976. Despite extensive radio airplay and television appearances, her 1977 single \"Save Me\" failed to chart. The track was covered in the US by Louise Mandrell who took it to number six on the US country chart in 1983. \"Save Me\" was also covered by the South African all-female band Clout (an SA no. 7 hit in 1979). Other artists who covered this song include Merrilee Rush and Helen Reddy. The failure of the Polydor album or any of the singles issued from it to reach the UK charts led to the label dropping her in 1978."]}, {"page": "Sandown", "response": ["* Cilla Black, Frankie Howerd, Tommy Cooper, Jimmy Tarbuck and Dickie Henderson were among the late 20th century performers doing summer seasons at Sandown Pier Pavilion "]}, {"page": "Immediate Records", "response": ["|IM-018||\u2013||Jimmy Tarbuck||\"Someday\"b/w \"Wastin' Time\""]}, {"page": "Rik Mayall", "response": ["In 1986, Mayall joined Planer, Edmondson and Elton to star as Richie Rich in Filthy Rich & Catflap, which was billed as a follow-up to The Young Ones. The idea of Filthy Rich and Catflap was a reaction to comments made by Jimmy Tarbuck about The Young Ones. The series' primary focus was to highlight the \"has been\" status of light entertainment. While Mayall received positive critical reviews, viewing figures were poor and the series was never repeated on the BBC. In later years, release on video, DVD and repeats on UK TV found a following. Mayall suggested that the series did not last because he was uncomfortable acting in an Elton project, when they had been co-writers on The Young Ones. In the same year, Mayall had a No. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart, when he and his co-stars from The Young Ones teamed with Cliff Richard to record \"Living Doll\" for the inaugural Comic Relief campaign. Mayall played Rick one last time in the Comic Relief stage-show and supported the Comic Relief cause for the rest of his life.  1987 saw Mayall co-star with Edmondson in one episode of the ITV sitcom Hardwicke House, although adverse reaction from press and viewers saw ITV withdraw the series after two episodes, leaving their appearance unbroadcast.
