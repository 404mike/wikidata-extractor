He played 225 league games in an eleven-year career in the Football League. He spent 1981 to 1984 with West Bromwich Albion, and also played on loan at Lincoln City, but spent most of his career at Port Vale. He was voted Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year in 1984\u201385, helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1985\u201386, and won the Third Division play-off final with the club in 1989. He was forced into early retirement in June 1992, following a broken leg sustained in October 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Webb", "response": ["Alan Webb may refer to:", "* Alan Webb (actor) (1906\u20131982), English actor", "* Alan Webb (runner) (born 1983), American track athlete", "* Alan Webb (footballer) (born 1963), retired English association football player"]}, {"page": "Simon Mills (footballer)", "response": ["Unable to fit him into the side due to the form of Ray Walker and others, Rudge converted Mills from a midfielder to a right-back. He made 19 Third Division appearances in 1987\u201388, scoring five goals. He played 55 games in 1988\u201389, playing in partnership first with fellow centre-backs Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell (who both struggled with injuries) and later Gary West and Dean Glover (who were signed mid-season), alongside full-backs Alan Webb and Darren Hughes, in front of goalkeeper Mark Grew. This proved to be the most successful defence in the division, conceding just 48 goals in 46 league games. However a third-place finish meant that they had to overcome Bristol Rovers 2\u20131 over two legs in the play-off final, with Robbie Earle hitting both goals. Mills missed just one Second Division game in 1989\u201390, forming a formidable defensive partnership with Glover. He played 45 games in 1990\u201391, as Vale retained their second tier status. He played 40 games in the 1991\u201392 relegation season, scoring twice, and helped the club to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. However, in autumn 1992 he developed knee trouble and underwent a series of unsuccessful operations, limiting him to just three league appearances in 1992\u201393. He was given a free transfer in May 1994. After retiring as a professional, he later attempted a comeback with Northern Premier League Premier Division sides Boston United and Matlock Town."]}, {"page": "Wayne Cegielski", "response": ["Cegielski left Wrexham with 123 league appearances to his name, and joined John McGrath's Fourth Division Port Vale in July 1982. He quickly slotted into the squad and was a regular in the 1982\u201383 promotion winning season, picking up the Player of the Year award at the end of the campaign. During the season he hit five goals in 48 games, striking in wins against Hereford United, Halifax Town, Crewe Alexandra, Aldershot, and Peterborough United. He then played 43 games in 1983\u201384, as the club suffered relegation. He fell out of favour under John Rudge in 1984\u201385, as Phil Sproson and Alan Webb built up a partnership."]}]}}
