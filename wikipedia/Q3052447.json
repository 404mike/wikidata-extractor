It was one of the last projects made by Harris. Catherwood played Joe his daughter (Cordellia), an ex-heroin addict. In preparation for this role the young actress spent time in Liverpool, where she worked on the accent and visited recovery centres.Emma appeared as a young prostitute, Sandra, in the ITV series The Vice. She starred opposite Ken Stott and James Frain. For the thriller Spirit Trap Catherwood lost weight and cut a severe fringe to portray the drug abusing, narcissistic character of Adele.

I felt so privileged to be in there with the amazing doctors, who do such a brilliant job... To watch someone crack open a chest is a wonderful experience.
