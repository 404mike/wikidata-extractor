Ross Ashby publishes Introduction to Cybernetics", "The terms systems theory and cybernetics have been widely used as synonyms. Some authors use the term cybernetic systems to denote a proper subset of the class of general systems, namely those systems that include feedback loops. However, Gordon Pask's differences of eternal interacting actor loops (that produce finite products) makes general systems a proper subset of cybernetics. In cybernetics, complex systems have been examined mathematically by such researchers as W. Ross Ashby, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann, and Heinz von Foerster."]}, {"page": "Automata theory", "response": ["1956 saw the publication of Automata Studies, which collected work by scientists including Claude Shannon, W.
