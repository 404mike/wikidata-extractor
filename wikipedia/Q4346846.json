The reverse-motion style had first been seen in 1989 for the video for the song \"The Second Summer of Love\" by Scottish band Danny Wilson. In order for Martin to appear to be singing the lyrics in the reversed footage, he had to learn to sing the song backwards, which took him a month. The video was filmed at various locations, including London and at Bourne Woods in Surrey, before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour. It was directed by Jamie Thraves.

Two versions were released on CD: the first with \"Gone Too Long\", \"Don't Let Me Change\", and the music video for \"Love Steals Us from Loneliness\" (directed by Jamie Thraves), while the second included \"Hold On to Your Breath\". The video is a homage to films by Jean-Luc Godard. Newton said the band struggled to persuade Parlophone to release the song as the first single; he felt it \"perfectly bridges where we were with the last album and where we are now\". Warnings/Promises was released by Parlophone on 7 March 2005; the album booklet includes a quote from Richard Brautigan. To promote the album, the band did a series of in-store acoustic performances.
