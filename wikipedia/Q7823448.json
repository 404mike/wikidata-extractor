Trailing by 2 points with 5 minutes remaining, the Rhinos were awarded a penalty. Captain Kevin Sinfield famously opted not to take a shot at goal which would have levelled the scores. The decision backfired with the Bulls' defensive line holding firm to deny the Rhinos their first major silverware in over 30 years. The cup final defeat did not appear to affect Leeds' Super League form as they established a commanding lead at the top of the table. In spite of this, it was announced in July 2003 that Powell would be moved into a director of rugby role the following season to make way for Tony Smith to take over as head coach. Following the announcement, the Rhinos form dipped and they surrendered their lead at the top of the table to the Bradford Bulls. They then crashed out of the play-offs without winning a game."]}, {"page": "1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|SH ||7||Tony Smith"]}, {"page": "James Lowes", "response": ["Lowes later moved to Warrington Wolves as an assistant coach, and was named head coach following the departure of Paul Cullen in the 2008 season.
