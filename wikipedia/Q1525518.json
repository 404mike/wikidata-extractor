Chadwick was at left-back covering Nick Ross who was unavailable to play. Everton made a bright start but did not score and then conceded a goal which changed the game. West Bromwich Albion went on the rampage and got two more before the half finished. Half-time - Everton 0-3 West Bromwich Albion. The second-half started positively for Everton and they got a goal back through Edgar Chadwick, a cousin. However, disaster struck as Frank Sugg had to leave the field of play with an injured right-foot. Matters got worse when with 15 minutes left James Coyne also stopped playing because of an injury. Down to nine men Everton had done well to contain West Bromwich Albion in the second-half but the Albion inevitably capitalised on the extra space and got a fourth goal."]}, {"page": "Nick Ross (disambiguation)", "response": ["Nick Ross (born 1947) is a British radio and television presenter.", "* Nick Ross (footballer, born 1862) (1862\u20131894), Scottish footballer, played for Hearts, Preston NE and Everton", "* Nick Ross (footballer, born 1991), Scottish footballer", "* Nick Ross (ice hockey) (born 1989), Canadian ice hockey player, currently plays for San Antonio Rampage in the AHL", "* Nick Ross (field hockey) (born 1990), New Zealand field hockey player"]}, {"page": "Nick Ross (footballer born 1863)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Ross (footballer, born 1862)"]}, {"page": "Roberts (footballer)", "response": ["Johnny Holt, the regular Everton centre-half, missed a few games due to injury and the visit of high-flying Wolverhampton Wanderers to Anfield on 9 February 1889 was one of those games missed. This gave Roberts a chance for his League and Everton debut in a match played on a frosty pitch that today - February 2018 - would not be played. Nick Ross, the Everton left-back, was missing playing for Lancashire County. The first half was end-to-end with both goalkeepers in action. However, as the half came to an end Edgar Chadwick put Everton ahead. 1-0 to Everton at half-time. Everton continued to press the Wolves defence and only Billy Rose, the Wolves goalkeeper kept Everton from extending their lead. In the last 20 minutes Rose's good work paid off when Wolverhampton equalised. With the match nearly over  and the game heading for a draw Wolverhampton stunned Everton with a winner which Everton players claimed was off-side. Final score - Everton 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers."]}, {"page": "William Brown (footballer, born 1865)", "response": ["James Costley was injured after a 6-2 home win over Derby County. On 3 November 1888 Bolton Wanderers were the visitors to Anfield and this match gave William Brown a chance for his League and Everton debut. He played outside-left. Very little happened in the first half and the scores were level, 0-0 at half-time. Early in the second-half Brown crowned his debut with a debut League goal putting a shot past Bolton goalkeeper, Sam Gillam. Bolton played well after Brown scored and quickly equalised. Brown formed a good partnership with Everton inside-left, Edgar Chadwick but it was Nick Ross who scored the winner with a powerful shot. Everton pressed for a third but it was Bolton who came closest to scoring. Everton hung on to the lead in a close fought match.
