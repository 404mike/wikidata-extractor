Spare first attended the school attached to St. Sepulchre's Church, at the top of Snow Hill (1891), and each day he would pass by Smithfield meat market, which being an animal lover, he detested.Baker 2011. pp. 6\u20137. In 1894, when Spare was seven, the family moved from Smithfield to Kennington, South London, setting up home at 15 Kennington Park Gardens. Here, Spare attended St. Agnes School, attached to a prominent High Anglican church, and as a child he was brought up within the Anglican denomination of Christianity.Baker 2011. pp. 9, 13. In later life he claimed to have met an elderly woman, Mrs Patterson (known as \"Witch Patterson\") at this time. Patterson claimed to be a descended from a line of Salem witches that Cotton Mather had failed to extirpate.Richard Cavendish (ed) Encyclopedia of the Unexplained: Magic, occultism and Parapsychology, p. 224 She seduced him and first taught him how to practise magic, although later biographer Phil Baker has noted that there is \"very little evidence\" that she was ever a real figure, instead perhaps being a later fictional invention of his.Baker 2011. pp. 11\u201312. Spare, who did not get on well with his real mother as a child, referred to Patterson as his 'second mother' or 'witch-mother'. Taking an interest in drawing, from about the age of 12, he began taking evening classes at Lambeth School of Art under the tutorship of Philip Connard.Baker 2011. p. 16."]}, {"page": "Southport", "response": ["* Philip Connard, artist, member of the Royal Academy of Arts"]}, {"page": "Edmund Blampied", "response": ["In January 1903, aged 16 years old and barely able to speak English, Blampied left Jersey to study at the Lambeth School of Art, where he was taught by Philip Connard R.A. and Thomas McKeggie.
