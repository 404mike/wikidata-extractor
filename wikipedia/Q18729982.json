She took part in the WSPU march to the Royal Albert Hall in June 1908. Billinghurst helped organise the WSPU response in the Haggerston by-election in July 1908, polling was on the day that twenty-four suffragettes were released from Holloway prison and came around the area canvassing to 'keep the Liberal out.'  In 1909, she was presumed by Annie Barnes to be the wheelchair user seen distracting a police horse, who laughed as another woman seemed to tip the rider off. He fell in the horse trough.

In July 1909 with twelve others, including Mary Leigh, Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper and another in her wheelchair [May Billinghurst perhaps] she was jailed for obstruction for trying to stop Lloyd George's public budget meeting in Limehouse.  The protest was witnessed by Annie Barnes who was inspired to join the East London Federation and influenced by Sylvia Pankhurst. On the way to Holloway prison the women arrested had shouted and sung protests and demanded to be treated in 'first division' in their own clothes as 'political' prisoners rather than criminals, this was not granted and the women broke 150 panes of glass at the prison and refused to give their names, prison officers had to use 'force necessary' to get the women into prison clothes. In Liverpool, in 1910, Baines was making speeches with Ada Flatman and Patricia Woodlock, when she was interrupted by Constance Lytton disguised as 'Jane Wharton' a seamstress asking 'the men and women of Liverpool to be the first to wipe out the stain [of force-feeding]' and a crowd followed them to the prison Governor John Dillon's house, chased by police."]}, {"page": "Annie Barnes", "response": ["Annie Barnes may refer to:", "* Annie Barnes (academic) (1903\u20132003), Swiss-English academic of French literature", "* Annie Barnes (suffragist) (1886\u20131982), British socialist and suffragist"]}]}}
