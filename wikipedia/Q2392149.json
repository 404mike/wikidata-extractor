It attracted many supporters, including Arthur Balfour, Churchill, David Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, King Edward VII (who used half-hour DST or \"Sandringham time\" at Sandringham), the managing director of Harrods, and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition proved stronger, including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, William Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, Napier Shaw (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre-owners. After many hearings, a parliamentary committee vote narrowly rejected the proposal in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. People in the U.S. demonstrated even more skepticim; Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee."]}, {"page": "Napier", "response": ["* Napier Shaw (1854\u20131945), British meteorologist"]}, {"page": "Met Office", "response": ["* Sir William Napier Shaw 1905\u20131920"]}, {"page": "1854 in science", "response": ["* March 4 \u2013 Napier Shaw (died 1945), English meteorologist."]}, {"page": "International Meteorological Organization", "response": ["*William Napier Shaw (U.K.), 1907 - 1923"]}, {"page": "1945 in science", "response": ["* March 23 \u2013 Napier Shaw (born 1854), English meteorologist."]}, {"page": "Royal Meteorological Society", "response": ["* 1918\u20131919: Sir Napier Shaw "]}, {"page": "Buys Ballot Medal", "response": ["* 1923 \u2013 Sir Napier Shaw, United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "Tephigram", "response": ["The tephigram was invented by Napier Shaw in 1915 and is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada.

Examples include the 1526 San Francisco hurricane (named after Saint Francis of Assisi, whose feast day is observed by Catholics on October\u00a04), the 1834 Padre Ruiz hurricane (named after a then-recently-deceased Catholic priest whose funeral service was being held in the Dominican Republic upon landfall there), the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane (named after Lake Okeechobee in the state of Florida, United States, where many of its effects were felt; also named the San Felipe II hurricane in the predominantly-Catholic island of Puerto Rico after a certain Saint Philip with a September\u00a013 feast day), and the 1938 New England hurricane. Credit for the first usage of personal names for weather is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887\u20131907. Wragge used names drawn from the letters of the Greek alphabet, Greek and Roman mythology and female names, to describe weather systems over Australia, New Zealand and the Antarctic. After the new Australian government had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director, Wragge started naming cyclones after political figures. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of the Second World War. Despite falling into disuse the naming scheme was occasionally mentioned in the press, with an editorial published in the Launceston Examiner newspaper on October 5, 1935 that called for the return of the naming scheme. Wragge's naming was also mentioned within Sir Napier Shaw\u2019s \u201cManual of Meteorology\u201d which likened it to a \"child naming waves\"."]}, {"page": "George Aubourne Clarke", "response": ["*Clouds; a Descriptive Illustrated Guide-book to the Observation and Classification of Clouds, with a preface by Sir Napier Shaw, Constable & Company, Ltd.
