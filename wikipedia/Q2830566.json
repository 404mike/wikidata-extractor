His grotesque and subversive style was a precursor of surrealism.  He illustrated an English edition of Voltaire's Candide (G. Routledge, 1922), Mark Twain's \n1601: A Tudor Fireside Conversation, a salute to scatology and Elizabethan manners (London: Printed for Subscribers only, 1936), and The Mimiambs of Herondas. He also designed the dust jacket for James Hanley's Ebb and Flow (London: John Lane, 1932), other Hanley novels for Lane, and Dorothy Richardson's Backwater (1916). He contributed to a number of periodicals such as The Gypsy, The Golden Hind (1922\u201325), the US Vanity Fair, The Studio, and the UK Argosy.Odle  was a distinctly bohemian figure and he associated with an artistic circle that included Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, and Wyndham Lewis. When he married Dorothy Richardson he was tubercular and an alcoholic, and was not expected to live long. However, he stopped drinking and lived until 1948. Odle was very thin and \"over six feet tall with waist-length hair wound around the outside of his head\", which he never cut. He also rarely cut his fingernails. From 1917 until 1939, the couple spent their winters in Cornwall and their summers in London; and then stayed permanently in Cornwall until Odle's death in 1948. Richardson supported herself and her husband with freelance writing for periodicals for many years, as Alan made little money from his art.\nAlan Odle's brother was Edwin Vincent Odle (1890\u20131942), author of the minor science fiction classic The Clockwork Man (1923), and Odle was a friend and correspondent of the writer Claude Houghton.The film director and Python Terry Gilliam is a connoisseur of his work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorothy Richardson", "response": ["She married the artist Alan Odle (1888-1948) in 1917 \u2013 a distinctly bohemian figure, associated with an artistic circle that included Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, and Wyndham Lewis.
