The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of Alberta Social Credit. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when R\u00e9al Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies.", "*\"Social Credit\" by Major Clifford Hugh Douglas"]}]}}
