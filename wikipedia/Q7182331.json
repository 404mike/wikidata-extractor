According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.", "In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Phil Rice stated that the ideas in Male Restroom Etiquette were based on observational humor that he had first seen in 2000 on the collaborative Internet site Everything2. In 2006, he decided to take a temporary hiatus from making machinima and to produce a short humorous work when he returned. He felt that the ideas about restroom behavior on Everything2 were well-suited for visual humor and adapted them into a screenplay. According to Rice, the film \"is rooted in the Juvenile humor that most men retain a secret fondness for, but don't get many opportunities to celebrate[, ...] but if the movie is too focused on that kind of humor, you'd lose the intelligent audience that I wrote the film for.\" Intending to make a parody of educational and social guidance films, Rice considered distributing the film in black-and-white, but decided against it.", "* Phil Rice answers some questions about the film"]}, {"page": "PHIL RICE", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Rice"]}]}}
