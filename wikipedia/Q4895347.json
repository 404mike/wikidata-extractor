He joined Merthyr Town in 1920 for their first season in the Football League and went on to play 125 league games, scoring 34 goals for the Welsh side. From 1922 to 1924, he was joined in the forward line by Ernest Turner, to whom he was not related.\nIn 1924 he returned to the Midlands, joining Coventry City, but left after 30 league games to play for non-league Brierley Hill Alliance. He joined Torquay United in 1927 and played in their first match in the Football League, scoring a penalty in a 1\u20131 draw with local rivals Exeter City at Plainmoor on 27 August 1927.\nHe missed just four games that season, but left at the end of it, joining Bristol Rovers before rejoining Brierley Hill Alliance and later playing for Standard Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["United's first match in the league took place on 27 August 1927, and was aptly against Exeter City at Plainmoor. The side for that first game was: Millsom, Cook, Smith, Wellock, Wragge, Conner, Mackey, Turner, Jones, McGovern, Thomson. A crowd of 11,625 watched a 1\u20131 draw with Torquay's goal coming from Bert Turner. The team's first season in the league, however, was not a success \u2013 they followed up the draw with Exeter with a 9\u20131 thrashing away at Millwall. Of the 48 games played that first season, Torquay won just 8, drawing 14 and losing 20. This meant that they finished their first season in the football league bottom of the table on 30 points and with a goals against tally of 103. Back then there was no automatic promotion and they were successfully re-elected to the league for the next season."]}, {"page": "Bert Turner", "response": ["Bert Turner may refer to:", "*Bert Turner (politician) (1888\u20131973), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*Bert Turner (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131953), English footballer who played for Merthyr Town, Coventry City, Torquay United and Bristol Rovers", "*Bert Turner (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131959), English footballer", "*Bert Turner (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131981), Welsh international footballer who played for Charlton Athletic"]}, {"page": "Bert Turner (footballer born 1899)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bert Turner (footballer, born 1899)"]}, {"page": "Herbert Turner (footballer born 1899)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bert Turner (footballer, born 1899)"]}]}}
