One of his most popular songs during his life was Just Touch the Harp Gently, My Pretty Louise, first published in 1870.  An 1890 profile of Mitchell in the Boston Globe reported that an astounding (and surely exaggerated) four million copies of the song had been sold.(11 December 1890).

It became popular in England, and eventually theatrical producer Lydia Thompson brought it back to America in the play Bluebeard, and it became popular in the United States as well.  Not making a living on his creations, Mitchell was toiling in a newspaper mailroom despite his lyrical successes.(21 February 1891).
