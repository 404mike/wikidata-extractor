The Oxford development economist Paul Collier has proposed that the gains of agglomeration should be taxed as rents which lead to behaviour-distorting rent-seeking (Henry George theorem). This would be both ethical and efficient, in that gains would be better aligned with deserts and rent-seeking would be curbed. Collier recommends a tax calculated by combining high income and metropolitan location, which can then be redistributed to other cities that have been hard hit by agglomeration.Collier, Paul (2018).

It cuts a nation off from important sea resources such as fishing, and impedes or prevents direct access to maritime trade, a crucial component of economic and social advance.  As such, coastal regions, or inland regions that have access to the World Ocean, tended to be wealthier and more heavily populated than inland regions that have no access to the World Ocean. Paul Collier in his book The Bottom Billion argues that being landlocked in a poor geographic neighborhood is one of four major development \"traps\" by which a country can be held back. In general, he found that when a neighboring country experiences better growth, it tends to spill over into favorable development for the country itself. For landlocked countries, the effect is particularly strong, as they are limited in their trading activity with the rest of the world. He states, \"If you are coastal, you serve the world; if you are landlocked, you serve your neighbors.\" Others have argued that being landlocked has an advantage as it creates a \"natural tariff barrier\" that protects the country from cheap imports. In some instances, this has led to more robust local food systems."]}, {"page": "Rebellion", "response": ["World Bank economists Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:"]}, {"page": "Copenhagen Consensus", "response": ["* Conflicts (Paul Collier)"]}, {"page": "Peace Research Institute Oslo", "response": ["* 2014: Paul Collier: Civil Conflict: What are the Current Risks, and What are the Realistic Solutions?"]}, {"page": "Hans Singer", "response": ["In commemoration and in honour of Sir Hans Singer the German Development Institute and the Institute of Development Studies initiated the Hans Singer Memorial Lecture on Global Development, which alternates between Bonn and Brighton on an annual basis.
