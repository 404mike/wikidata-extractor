He had a number of short-term jobs before completing an apprenticeship in iron founding, and joining the Friendly Society of Iron Founders (FSIF).  He also studied at night school and qualified as a sanitary inspector.Davison became increasingly prominent in the FSIF, becoming chairman of its executive, then its full-time national organiser.  During World War I, he served on advisory councils for the Ministry of Munitions and the Board of Trade.At the 1918 general election, he was elected as MP for the new Smethwick constituency on the outskirts of Birmingham.  It was an unusual electoral contest: there was no Conservative Party or Liberal Party candidate, and his only opponent was Christabel Pankhurst of the Women's Party, who was supported by the alliance of the Conservative Party and the David Lloyd George-led Coalition Liberal faction.\nDavison won the seat with a majority of only 775 votes, and was returned to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election with a margin of only 382 votes over his only opponent, a Conservative.  He was re-elected by more comfortable margins at the 1923 general election and at the 1924 general election, but resigned his seat in 1926 due to poor health.\nThe resulting by-election on 21 December 1926, was won by the Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, who went on to found the New Party and the British Union of Fascists.\nDavison died in March 1927, aged 56.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emmeline Pankhurst", "response": ["In November 1917 the WSPU's weekly newspaper announced that the WSPU was to become the Women's Party. Twelve months later on Tuesday 19 November at the Queen's Hall in London Emmeline Pankhurst said that her daughter Christabel would be their candidate at the forthcoming General Election, the first at which women could stand as candidates. They didn't say which constituency they would fight but a few days later Westbury in Wiltshire was identified. Emmeline lobbied Prime Minister David Lloyd George to ensure Christabel would have coalition backing. However, as these discussions were taking place the Pankhurst's switched their attention to Smethwick in Staffordshire. The Coalition had already settled on a local candidate, Major Samuel Nock Thompson, but Bonar Law, the Conservative leader, was persuaded to ask Thompson to withdraw. Significantly, Christabel was not issued with a formal letter of support from the two leaders, the Coalition Coupon. Christabel then had a straight fight with the Labour candidate John Davison and lost by 775 votes. The Women's Party fought no other elections and closed soon after.Hallam, David J.A.
