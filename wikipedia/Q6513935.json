However, Bradley's performance received criticism from Walsall's supporters for his inconsistency, causing manager Richard Money to respond, pleading them to be patient with the player. Bradley scored his first career goal for the club, in 3\u20132 victory at Doncaster Rovers on 2 October 2007. This was followed up by scoring his second goal for Walsall, in a 4\u20130 victory at Huddersfield Town.

You just hope he will continue to keep his head down and impress and while he is in the team people are looking at him. At the moment he needs to impress our manager and if he does that it makes it hard to drop him from the team.\" After missing two matches due to international commitment, Bradley scored his third goal for the club and set up a goal for Ishmel Demontagnac, in a 2\u20130 victory at Northampton Town on 24 November 2007.

(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["Derby had budgeted for a fourth bottom finish (i.e. survival) in the Premier League and when this was not achieved the club was once again plunged into financial crisis. In an attempt to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking the club rejected offers for their better players over the summer -such as Malcolm Christie, Mart Poom, Danny Higginbotham and Chris Riggott \u2013 and an opening day 3\u20130 win over Reading seemed to have justified the decision. However, this proved a false dawn and a 1\u20130 defeat away to Gillingham in the next game signalled what was to come as the club won just 10 of its opening 29 fixtures and suffered embarrassing cup exits to lower league teams Brentford (FA Cup) and Oldham Athletic (League Cup). Players weren't paid on time (resulting in Danny Higginbotham going on strike), with high earning players such as Georgi Kinkladze and Fabrizio Ravanelli underperforming, and the club was trading insolvent. Christie, Riggott, Higginbotham and Poom were eventually sold in the January 2002 Transfer window, netting considerably less than they would have if sold the previous summer, and joined players like Horacio Carbonari, Darryl Powell and Deon Burton in exiting the club (Burton leaving as the club's most capped ever player, with 42 appearances for Jamaica). With the club low on registered professionals, home grown youngsters were given a chance at first team level, with Lee Holmes (who became the youngest player in the club's history when he took the field against Grimsby aged 15 years and 268 days), Lee Grant, Pablo Mills, Izale McLeod and Lee Camp all handed debuts throughout the course of the season. Although the club won its first game following the exodus 3\u20130 against Rotherham United they then embarked on 9 match winless streak which seriously threatened relegation. The eight match of this run was a 0\u20133 defeat by Nottingham Forest and Gregory was suspended the next day, the club alleging serious misconduct. Nothing specific was ever offered ad the next board had to pay Gregory a seven figure settlement. Gregory's replacement (initially on a short-term contract until the end of the season but then appointed full-time) was former Ipswich Town boss George Burley. His remit was simple: avoid relegation. A 2\u20131 win over Norwich City in Burley's first match got his reign off to the perfect start, and although only 6 points were taken from the next 6 games, it was enough to finish 18th in the league with 52 points, 6 clear of relegated Sheffield Wednesday in 22nd.", "Burley's first full season in charge brought little joy, as they recorded a 20th-placed finish in the 2003\u201304 Division One, just 1 point clear of relegation with safety not confirmed until the penultimate game of the season with a 2\u20130 win over Millwall. With no money for players, and the need to slash the club's wage bill, big names such as Fabrizio Ravanelli, Georgi Kinkladze and Craig Burley left the club with the gaps of their departure shored up by free signings; Candido Costa was taken on a season long loan whilst seven others \u2013 including Mathias Svensson and Leon Osman \u2013 were recruited on short-term loans, as Derby used a club record 36 different players in the course of the season. Of the eight loanees, only Everton's Osman made a significant impact and without him Derby could well have been relegated, as the club collected almost half of its 52 points from his 17 games. There was also the continued introduction of academy players to the side, with Tom Huddlestone and Marcus Tudgay making significant contributions alongside players such as Lee Grant and Lee Holmes. Burley achieved safety against a background of boardroom uncertainty \u2013 Chairman Lionel Pickering, after putting temporary faith in former Coventry City chairman Bryan Richardson and a notional \u00a330m bond, was removed from the chair after the club temporarily entered receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of \u00a31 each.", "In the 2011\u201312 season Derby started the season well, winning their first 4 league games in August, which was also the club's best league start since the 1905\u201306 season. However, the club were knocked out of the first round of League Cup against League Two opposition for the third season in a row against Shrewsbury Town. Derby maintained their top 2 position in September, with the main highlight being a 2\u20131 win at local rivals Nottingham Forest, despite the fact that goalkeeper Frank Fielding gave away a penalty and was sent off after 67 seconds, Jeff Hendrick's winner in the game was his first goal in senior football. October and November were disappointing with Derby picking up only 1 win and 5 points out of a possible 30 as Derby fell to 15th place in the league, with a 4\u20130 defeat at rivals Leicester City at the start of the month, starting the slump in form. In mid-October, Nigel Clough and his backroom staff signed new -year contracts. Derby picked up form in December and January, losing only twice in 9 games, picking up 17 points as Derby ended the month 12th peaking at 8th in mid-January. February was another disappointing month, where they picked up on 1 point, scoring no goals with them club suffering their 2nd 4\u20130 defeat of the season to the hands of Southampton by the end of the month, Derby were 15th in the table. From the start of April to mid march, Derby picked up 14 points out a possible 21 which lifted Derby to 11th in the table, 5 points off the play-offs with 4 games remaining, Derby manager Nigel Clough however ruled out a play-off place, wishing there was more the 4 games left as the club were showing great form. However defeats to Middlesbrough and Cardiff City in 4 days ended the Derby's play-off chances. Derby finished the season 12th in the league, 11 points off the play-off players, with Nigel Clough being satisfied with the performances of the team, stating a lack of firepower as the reason why they fell short and a target to improve in 2012\u201313. Derby ended the season with a win and a draw as they finished in 12th place on 64 points, 7 places and 15 points better off than the previous season, the club's first top half finish since promotion in 2007 and best league standing since relegation in 2008. Derby's summer signings had mixed fortunes with Craig Bryson, Jason Shackell & Frank Fielding all being in contention for the Player of the Year award. Striker Theo Robinson was joint top scorer with Steve Davies on 12 goals and Jamie Ward's form impressed enough to earn him a new contract. Tom Naylor also earned praise from Nigel Clough for his development and impressed when standing in for John Brayford at right-back. Nathan Tyson, signed from local rivals Forest however failed to score in 24 appearances, Chris Maguire struggled to break into the first team and was loaned out to Portsmouth for the final two months of the season. Chris Riggott rejoined the club on a one-year contract, but was released in December due to injuries. The club relied less on loan signings and more on the club's academy as Jeff Hendrick, Mark O'Brien, Callum Ball, Mason Bennett and Will Hughes all broke into the first team, Bennett and Hughes making their debuts with Bennett setting a club record for youngest ever team player, making his first appearance against Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at 15 years and 99 days old, beating Lee Holmes' record by 169 days. The club's reserve side had a less successful year than in the two previous seasons, with the club missing out on the Central League title by one point from Sheffield United, as well as being beaten in the Derbyshire Senior Cup final by Buxton. Derby also reached the final of the Central League Cup final against Manchester City Elite Development squad. The club recorded an average attendance of 26,020, 3 down previous campaign but still the third highest in the Championship behind West Ham United and Southampton. This was also the 14th best average attendance in the country, higher than the average gate of eight Premier League clubs. In October 2011, Derby County announced that they had submitted plans to Derby City Council for a \u00a37 million development of land outside the stadium, which the club named \"The Plaza @ Pride Park\". The plans included five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. The plans were scaled down from the planned \u00a320 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that the plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations, due to be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza was intended to be reinvested back into the club. The planned development also coincided with plans from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza. Derby City Council's Planning Control Committee gave planning permission for The Plaza @ Pride Pride Park development in January 2012, with chief executive Tom Glick stating the club had started looking for a development company to build the plaza."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Lee Holmes||||2006||16||0||"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["|Lee Holmes"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|11||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Lee Holmes"]}, {"page": "\u00c1d\u00e1m Bogd\u00e1n", "response": ["On 20 December, he made his Premier League debut for the Reds in a 3\u20130 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road, dropping a corner kick after three minutes to allow Nathan Ak\u00e9 to open the scoring.

Reflecting on Clough's comments, the Derby Evening Telegraph stated \"The conveyor belt at Derby has juddered and stalled at times and in many ways it has been rusted by constant changes within the Academy set up\" before highlighting past academy-graduates England international Tom Huddlestone, Northern Ireland international Lee Camp, Wales international Lewin Nyatanga and England U21 internationals Lee Grant, Giles Barnes and Lee Holmes (all of whom were no longer with the club) as examples that the current youth set-up should aim to emulate.
