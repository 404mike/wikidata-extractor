Though the financial structure and annual revenue of Zomba during the company's independent period was only known to CEO Clive Calder (the company was registered privately offshore in the Dutch Antilles), Zomba was widely regarded as the most successful of the independent music companies.", "In late 1971, Clive Calder and Ralph Simon began their two-decade partnership in forming businesses in record production and promotion, music publishing, artist management and concert promotion in South Africa. Because of the market in South Africa, there was a need to branch out into various aspects of the business, instead of just focusing on one aspect of the industry. \"You couldn't do just one thing. It was too small,\" explained David Gresham, CEO of David Gresham Record Company. \"This is not a country where you have a million-seller. A No. 1 record is a 10,000 unit seller. That only pays the rent for a month or two.\" While almost mandatory in South Africa, this early style of music company would be adapted to other markets throughout the companies history, and would become a staple of Calder's managing legacy.", "Early companies formed by Calder and Simon were Sagittarius Management and Clive Calder Productions (CCP). CCP was distributed by EMI Records South Africa who purchased the company in 1972.  Although Calder has no stake in it now, it still exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of Universal Music, having acquired most of EMI in 2013, specializing in the recording, development and marketing of domestic artists. Calder's relationship with EMI began when he had been an A&R Manager at EMI South Africa for eighteen months. There he had signed some big groups for the time such as Freedom's Children and the Otis Waygood Blues Band. During this time, Calder was also a bassist in a few bands. He formed the Four Dukes and the In Crowd with EMI artist Peter Vee, whom he also produced. Calder eventually paired Lee with a young producer named Mutt Lange, who at the time had produced for David Gresham and David Gresham Records local hit \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\" by Jessica Jones on Gresham's Nitty Gritty Records.", "Around 1993, Clive Calder began his uneasy relationship with Lou Pearlman. Pearlman had put together a new group, Backstreet Boys, which was languishing on Mercury Records without any hits. Pearlman presented the group to Calder along with Jive A&R rep David McPherson. Though Calder was initially uninterested in the boy band due to the dominance of grunge and alternative rock music, Calder later thought the group could help expand his operations overseas. Zomba bought out the boys' contract for $35,000 and moved the group over to Zomba imprint Jive. Calder immediately sent the group to Sweden and matched them with a group of producers found through Zomba scouts: Dag Volle and Martin Sandberg. In mid-1995, the band recorded three songs including their first single at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm. Calder then connected the Boys with old friend Stuart Watson; Watson ran SWAT Enterprises, a company specializing in promotion in Asia. The Boys began touring relentlessly in Asia and released their first album, which sold one million copies in three weeks. In 1997, when Calder thought the grunge phenomenon had sufficiently passed, he had the Backstreet Boys return to the United States where their North American debut ended up selling upwards of 14 million copies, creating the first in a run of many hits that Zomba and the Backstreet Boys would enjoy together.", "In 1999, Zomba was involved in a \"boy band controversy\" when trying to sign another group that Pearlman had put together himself, *NSYNC.  NSYNC had recently left RCA due to allegations that Pearlman had taken approximately 50% of their profits and not the one-sixth that he had agreed to. Seeing the group as a \"free-agent,\" Jive quickly signed them and prepared to release their next album. On 12 October, Pearlman's company Trans Continental, in conjunction with RCA owner BMG Entertainment and BMG Ariola Munich sued Jive Records, Clive Calder, and the members of NSYNC for $150 million, citing, among other things, breach of contract. Pearlman sought an injunction against the release of the band's new album and demanded the group's recordings be given to him, but Pearlman was denied in court. As a response to the suit, and in reference to treatment by Trans Continental, NSYNC released a statement citing the company's poor conduct as \"the most glaring, overt, and callous example of artist exploitation that the music industry has seen in a long time.\" The lawsuit was settled on 23 December with undisclosed terms, leaving Jive free to release future NSYNC albums.", "BMG had owned 25% of Zomba's publishing business since 1991 and 20% of its recording business since 1996. As part of BMG's 1996 agreement with Zomba, the music giant was required to follow through on a put option and buy the remaining shares it did not already own before 31 December 2002. In June 2002, Clive Calder decided to exercise the put option. Effective 26 November 2002, BMG Entertainment concluded its deal with Zomba for the purchase of the company's entire assets. While Calder had originally requested $3.2 billion for his shares in Zomba, valuation of the label's assets varied from $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion. Following the purchase negotiations, a price of $2.74 billion was agreed upon, the biggest purchase of an independent label at the time. Zomba's sale had been the latest in a series of independent label sellouts including Island Records and Geffen Records (both sold to Universal for $300 million and $550 million, respectively), and Virgin (sold for $950 million to EMI). The $2.74 billion paid for the Zomba Group was more than was paid for the purchase of many others labels including Island, Geffen, Virgin, A&M, Motown, Chrysalis, and Def Jam, combined.", "The structure of the Zomba Group during the independent era (1975 to 2002) is difficult to precisely pinpoint due to the private nature of Clive Calder's managing style. During that period, Calder's private investment group Summer Shore NV controlled the Zomba group. The company began as Zomba Management and Publishers as early as 1975. They expanded to the US, first with a publishing sector in 1978, and then a records division in 1981 while the management and publishing divisions became separate companies. Also sometime during that period, they started a production division initially called Zomba Productions Ltd., which would become Zomba Recording Corporation. From a legal standpoint, Zomba's holdings are divided into their music publishing business (Zomba Music Holdings BV) and music recording business (Zomba Record Holdings BV). The former holds only music publishing (i.e., written music) rights, while the latter holds all of the recorded music rights, along with some publishing groups acquired over the years.
