Wrexham's season came to a head on 27 April 1993 when with two games left they travelled to Northampton Town requiring a win to gain promotion to the next tier of the English football. The game ended with a 2\u20130 victory to Wrexham and the 5,500 travelling \"Reds\" supporters there were jubilant when promotion had finally been achieved.", "The 1994\u201395 season would see Wrexham achieve more success in cup competitions, this time going on a run through the FA Cup. Having beaten Stockport County and Rotherham United, they faced Premier League side Ipswich Town at the Racecourse, with Wrexham running out 2\u20131 winners thanks to goals from Gary Bennett and Kieron Durkan.
