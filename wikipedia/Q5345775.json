The earliest reference found is to Thomas Tuck whose \"Tuck's Coffee House\" in Norwich, United Kingdom was popular among the city's literary circles in the late 18th Century. There was a library for the use of customers, and it was located on Gentleman\u2019s Walk in the heart of the city. It is mentioned as a place of legal negotiation in public notices published in the Norfolk Chronicle on 9 February 1782 and 12 and 19 April 1783. In 1820, William Joseph Tuck was a confectioner at Duncan Place, Hackney, outside London. Hackney and nearby London Fields were fashionable for picnic outings and holidays at the time. The London Directory of 1846 records his son Thomas James Tuck as a baker at \"The Bun House\" in Duncan Place. Edward Walford in his Old and New London: Volume 5 of 1879 states: \"In the short thoroughfare connecting the London Fields with Goldsmiths' Row there is a shop which in bygone times was almost as much noted for its 'Hackney Buns' as the well-known Bun-house at Chelsea was for that particular kind of pastry.\" "]}, {"page": "Second Council of Ephesus", "response": ["* Edward Walford, translator, The Ecclesiastical History of Evagrius: A History of the Church from AD 431 to AD 594, 1846.
