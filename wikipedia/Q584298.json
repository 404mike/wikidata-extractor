Rolling Stone said of Black \"Hands down, Pauline Black possessed the best voice that ever graced a 2-Tone release. Blessed with a bewitching soprano and dramatic panache, Black's voice reached plateaus that made every other musical detail sound like part of a backdrop painted just to set the stage for her entrance.\" Black has also been an actress, with roles in films and television.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Selecter", "response": ["The Selecter featured a diverse line-up, both in terms of race and gender, initially consisting of Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson and Pauline Black on lead vocals, Neol Davies and Compton Amanor on guitar, Desmond Brown on Hammond organ, Charley 'H' Bembridge on drums, and Charley Anderson on bass. The band's name is based on the term \"selector\", which is a Jamaican word for disc jockey. The band were one of the most successful ska bands of the 2 Tone era, notching up several top forty singles in the British charts.  Having co-released the first 2 Tone Ska single with The Specials, they are considered one of the founding acts of the movement.  Though highly influential, the original lineup only remained together for a year, and even with replacement players the band only continued until breaking up in 1981.", "The Selecter reformed in 1991 and vocalist Black continued to perform and release music under The Selecter name until 2006.  By 2011, another version of the band featuring Neol Davies was touring separately. In June 2011 Black applied for, and won, The Selecter trademark and the right to use the name herself.  The reformed, Pauline Black-led lineup still tours and releases albums under The Selecter name, most recently releasing Daylight, the band's 15th studio album, in 2017.", "In 1977, Neol Davies and John Bradbury (who later became a member of The Specials), with the trombone player Barry Jones, recorded a track in a recording session in 1977\u201378 that resulted in \"Kingston Affair\".

It was released in March 1979, reaching 6 in the UK Charts. The track was written by Davies and Bradbury. Guitarist Davies added long time friends Desmond Brown, who played Hammond organ, and Charley Anderson on bass guitar. With Compton Amanor on guitar, the vocals of Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson and Charley 'H' Bembridge on drums the seven piece line-up for the original band was completed when Pauline Black was spotted by Davies.

Nonetheless, the album has more recently been reappraised, and is considered by lead singer Pauline Black to be among the band's best work. Captain Oi Records remastered the album in 2001.", "The Selecter's debut album Too Much Pressure (1980), with its blend of ska, reggae and punk and socio conscious lyrics, was a critical and commercial success; however, the aftermath of its release was fraught with problems for the band. Their relationship with 2 Tone Records was diminishing, who were releasing merchandise without band consent, and also felt \"there were not enough avenues for them to broaden their musical horizons again this was due to the huge success of 2 Tone.\" During these events, the group \"admitted that they were less than happy\" with Too Much Pressure, which they felt was the product of what their singer Pauline Black recalled was \"a life-span, which was telescoped down into a very short space of time\". The band left the label and signed a direct deal with its parent label Chrysalis to record their second album, Celebrate the Bullet. They recorded a non-album single, \"The Whisper\", which was a Top 40 hit.", "Upon release, Celebrate the Bullet was received indifferently by music critics. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau rated the album \"B\u2013\" and said \"with Pauline Black fallen under the influence of Lene Lovich and the groove wavering along with her, it's up to the songwriting. Which features more dreams, water, reflections, stormy weather, and \"jagged imagery\" than is healthy for bomb scare victims or ska bands.\" Several retrospective reviews are similarly muted in their praise; Chris Woodstra of Allmusic rated the album two stars out of five, saying it \"failed to live up to the promise of the band's debut,\" and although commenting that \"it has its moments,\" \"those can all be found on the collection, Selected Selecter Selections.\" Trouser Press said the record contained \"little of the first LP's brilliance; although the performances don't lack anything tangible, the songwriting is vastly less inspired and none of the anti-trendy cleverness so vital to the previous album's uniqueness can be discerned.\"", "Nonetheless, the album has in more recent times has seen more praise than distaste.

One member of the duo said he bought the song when it was released and noted it \"still sends shivers down my spine.\" Sean Diamond of Louder Than War was favourable towards the record in 2013, describing it as \"a tense recording dripping with cold war paranoia and fear for the future which still sounds alarmingly prescient today.\"", "# \"Deep Water\" (Pauline Black) [4.09]", "# \"Red Reflections\" (Pauline Black) [3.38]", "# \"Bristol and Miami\" (Pauline Black) [4.58]", "*Pauline Black - vocals"]}, {"page": "Pucker!", "response": ["After re-forming with a new line-up in 1991, consisting of founding members Pauline Black and Neol Davies alongside drummer Perry Melius and former Bad Manners members Nick Welsh and Martin Stewart, The Selecter underwent a live reunion tour, leading to the acclaimed live album Out in the Streets (1992).
