It was proposed by a group of London speculators, who offered to finance it totally in exchange for monopoly use of the facility. The plan was supported by the newspapers but opposed by Port Adelaide business interests, and by the Legislative Council select committee which saw that it would be inimical to South Australia's long-term interests.\nThey tendered for construction of lighthouses and jetties, beginning with the Cape Jaffa lighthouse, as agents for Wells Brothers, eminent British engineers, whose principal was a brother of Percy Wells.\nHe was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Flinders and sat from October 1855 to February 1857, November 1862 to September 1866 (when he resigned) and May 1868 to February 1875. He was appointed to several committees and commissions, where his financial expertise proved valuable, but with advancing years his intellect deteriorated and he no longer appeared in public. He died after a long illness and was buried in the grounds of Clayton Congregational Church, Kensington.He succeeded Herbert Aylwin as Consul for Sweden and Norway from about 1865 to 1875, succeeded by Edmund William Wright.", "link_mentions": {}}}
