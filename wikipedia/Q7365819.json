Yet despite this, and his modest playing record, he is remembered as a success in that his captaincy laid the foundation of Yorkshire's dominance of the County Championship during the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["Yorkshire recommended him to join Saltaire Cricket Club, who played in the Bradford League, and he made his debut for them at their Roberts Park ground against Baildon, his local club. He played for Saltaire for three seasons, from 1938 to 1940, on one occasion scoring a century. In the 1938 season, his last at school, he played for Salts HS on Saturday morning and for Saltaire CC in the afternoon. Laker still thought of himself as a batsman and his contemporary Ronnie Burnet, who became Yorkshire's captain in the late 1950s, recalled that Laker bowled a mixed bag of \"fast off-cutters-cum-spinners\" before the Second World War. Charlie Lee, one of Laker's Saltaire team-mates, had a similar recollection saying that \"Jim bowled all sorts of stuff and generally enjoyed himself without ever appearing to have the makings of a great bowler\"."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["On 21 January 1984 the Yorkshire Club committee, in the face of this rising pressure, agreed to offer Boycott a contract for 1984. Several members of the committee, including Trueman, Billy Sutcliffe and Ronnie Burnet, resigned. Of the replacement members, 17 were from the Members 84 Group, and Boycott himself was elected, leaving him with both a position on the team and on the Yorkshire Club committee.McKinstry, pp. 244\u2013246. The 1984 season was, however, not the most prolific for Boycott. McKinstry records that he scored slowly in several matches: 60 in 52 overs against Somerset; 53 in 51 overs against Hampshire; 17 in 26 overs against Leicestershire; 77 in 67 overs against Sussex. This was coupled with continued friction between himself and both players and club members.Mckinstry, p. 248. In particular, Boycott's place on both the team and the committee led to feelings of distrust from both \u2013 though Boycott denies this \u2013 which led to the loss of support from long-term ally Sid Fielden.McKinstry, pp. 250\u2013251."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new captain in 1958. Not an accomplished player, though he had previously captained the club's Second XI, he was a good man-manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons.Arlott, pp. 98\u201399. The other \"trouble-maker\", Appleyard, lost his ability as a result of his illnesses and Yorkshire dropped him for good mid-season. Although the team could only finish 11th in the County Championship, having lost 24 full days to the weather, it was a much happier dressing room than it had been since 1946. Regular team members now included Binks, Brian Bolus, Burnet, Close, Cowan, Trueman, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, David Pickles, Phil Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was really beginning to take shape.Arlott, p. 99."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Large crowds flocked to the cricket after the Second World War with 47,000 people attending the 3 days of the Roses Match at Bramall Lane in 1946. Yorkshire won the first post-war Championship. New players after the war included spinner Johnny Wardle, all-rounder Brian Close and fast bowler Fred Trueman. Another newcomer Bob Appleyard became the first bowler to take 200 wickets in his first full season in 1951. The 1950s were dominated by Surrey, who won seven successive championships. Yorkshire had internal problems which were resolved before the 1959 season in which Yorkshire recovered the title under Ronnie Burnet.", "In 1960, Vic Wilson became Yorkshire's first professional captain since Tom Emmett when he succeeded Ronnie Burnet. Brian Close, who took over in 1963, has been Yorkshire's most successful professional captain with four County Championships."]}, {"page": "Brian Close", "response": ["Meanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single County Championship. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, Ronnie Burnet, was appointed. Burnet was 40\u00a0years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes. It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; Johnny Wardle, Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe", "response": ["The master\u2013apprentice relationship changed after Hutton scored a world record 364 for England against Australia at The Oval in 1938. Future Yorkshire captain Ronnie Burnet reckoned that Sutcliffe had been the dominant partner until then and their scores would be something like 60 to 40 in Sutcliffe's favour. After Hutton made his record, his confidence increased and Burnet said the ratio was reversed \"to 70:30 in Len's favour\". Burnet said that Hutton was \"tearing attacks apart in 1939 and Herbert was by then playing second fiddle\".Hill, p.174."]}, {"page": "Vic Wilson (cricketer)", "response": ["Though he was by then far from guaranteed a place in the first team, Wilson survived the purge of Yorkshire's playing staff in 1958 which saw Johnny Wardle, Bob Appleyard and Frank Lowson leave the staff and a new young team take shape under the captaincy of Ronnie Burnet. After Burnet retired, Wilson was appointed as the first professional county captain of Yorkshire in 1960. He had a successful tenure, leading the club to the County Championship title in 1960 and 1962. He retired in 1962, and was succeeded by Brian Close for the 1963 season."]}, {"page": "Frank Lowson", "response": ["At the end of the 1958 season, Yorkshire having endured the least successful period in its history in terms of lack of County Championship success, the Yorkshire committee and new captain Ronnie Burnet decided to go for a policy of youth and dispensed with the services of several senior players, including Johnny Wardle, Bob Appleyard and Lowson. The move was a success in that Yorkshire won the Championship the following season, 1959, but Lowson went back to League cricket at the age of 33, and never played first-class cricket again. He went on to build a career in insurance.Wisden 1985"]}, {"page": "Playfair Cricket Annual", "response": ["* 1960: Abbas Ali Baig, Trevor Bailey, Ken Barrington, Ronnie Burnet, Colin Cowdrey, Ray Illingworth, Jim Parks, Geoff Pullar, MJK Smith, Jim Stewart, Bryan Stott"]}, {"page": "Bryan Stott", "response": ["In 190 first-class matches, this solid left-handed opening batsman scored 9,248 runs at 31.45, with 17 centuries, and best scores of 186 against Warwickshire and 181 against Essex. After several years of sporadic appearances, he became a first team regular in 1957, while his best season came in 1959, when he scored over 2,000 runs for the only time and helped Yorkshire, under Ronnie Burnet, win the County Championship.  He took ninety one catches and seven wickets at 16.00 with his rarely seen medium pace, including 4 for 34 against Surrey.
