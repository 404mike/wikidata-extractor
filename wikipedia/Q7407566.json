Both cars sustained heavy damage and recovery from trackside equipment allowed McNish and Lehto to return to the garage for extensive repairs. Soon after vacating the No. 8 car in the garage McNish collapsed and two doctors examined him. He was taken to the circuit's medical centre suffering from a sore knee and concussion. Doctors ruled him unfit for the rest of the event. The safety cars were deployed to slow the race as marshals worked to clear debris from the track. As the safety cars were recalled Brabham's Zytek vehicle sustained bodywork damage from picking up a puncture and John Field crashed the No. 27 Intersport Lola car at the second Mulsanne Chicane. Later in the second hour, the Champion and Team Goh Audi entries returned to the track outside of the top 40 overall positions. Ryo Michigami's No. 9 Kondo Dome vehicle had a transmission failure on the final third of the lap and he drove to the garage for repairs.
