The novel Robots and Empire and the short stories \"Evidence\" and \"The Tercentenary Incident\" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human. On the other hand, \"The Bicentennial Man\" and \"\u2014That Thou Art Mindful of Him\" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. Gwendoline Butler writes in A Coffin for the Canary \"Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human.\" In The Robots of Dawn, Elijah Baley points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there."]}, {"page": "E.
