He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1903 to 1906.\nRobinson was born in Northallerton in Yorkshire. He moved to New Zealand when young, and worked in a softgoods warehouse until c. 1871, when he moved to Melbourne, Victoria, working as a warehouseman for Dodgshun and Co in Flinders Lane. He subsequently relocated to Tasmania to head the firm's Launceston branch, James Dodgshun and Sons, before opening his own warehousing business, M. E. Robinson & Co.

He was a trustee of the Queen Victoria Hospital, Sunday school superintendent and warden of St John's Church and president of the Commercial Travellers' Association.Robinson first attempted to enter state politics in April 1903, but was defeated for the seat of West Launceston by David Storrer.

He took a five-month trip abroad to the United States and Canada during his term. He was defeated in 1906.He later served a three-year stint as a City of Launceston councillor from 1914.
