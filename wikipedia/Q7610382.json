He's come on again this season \u2013 that's good as we are expecting boys to do men's jobs.\" It was in this match that Pejic scored his only goal for the club. He featured for Wrexham in the 2005 Football League Trophy Final on 10 April 2005, after coming on as a substitute for Stephen Roberts on 14 minutes, which finished in a 2\u20130 victory over Southend United after extra time. He made 44 appearances in 2004\u201305, which saw Wrexham go into administration and relegated to League Two. Pejic missed four months of 2005\u201306 after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in August 2005 but returned in January 2006, helping Wrexham to the final of the FAW Premier Cup for the second year in succession.
