Reading A Short Walk was a revelation. The superbly crafted, eccentric and evocative story of his Afghan travels was like a call to arms.\" Outside magazine includes A Short Walk among its \"25 essential books for the well-read explorer\", while Salon.com has the book in its list of \"top 10 travel books of the [20th] century\". The Daily Telegraph too enjoyed the English humour of the book, including it in a list of favourite travel books, and describing Newby and Carless's meeting with the explorer Wilfred Thesiger as a \"hilarious segment\". It quotes \"We started to blow up our air-beds. 'God, you must be a couple of pansies,' said Thesiger.\" The Swedish journalist and travel writer  noted that the meeting with Thesiger represented, in Newby's exaggerated account, a collision between two generations of travel writers who travelled, wrote, and related to strangers quite differently."]}]}}
