With many players moving on, the new management team had to rebuild the side from scratch, but an encouraging second half of the season saw the Glassboys finish a creditable 9th.  The following season saw a memorable run in the FA Vase, culminating in a quarter-final defeat at A.F.C. Sudbury in the quarter-final before finally succumbing to a 4\u20131 defeat after extra time.  In May 2005 Hackett took sole charge of the team after Ford decided to step down due to work and family commitments.  With the likely re-organisation of the non-league pyramid at Step 4 level, the club looked to mount a strong push for promotion, however a mixed start to the campaign left Stourbridge lying in mid-table by December.  After a poor start, a run of 14 league games unbeaten was enough to clinch a runners-up spot and with it promotion back to the Southern League.  Victories over Burton Albion and Moor Green also saw the team reach the Birmingham Senior Cup Final for the first time in 30 years, although they succumbed to a 1\u20130 defeat to Willenhall Town."]}, {"page": "Hagley", "response": ["*Jon Ford (born 1968), professional footballer with Swansea AFC, Bradford City etc."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Ford", "response": ["Jonathan Ford or Jon Ford may refer to:", "*Jon Ford (Australian politician) (born 1958), Australian politician", "*Jon Ford (footballer) (born 1968), English former footballer", "*Jon Ford (American politician) (born 1972), Indiana State Senator", "*Professor Jon Ford, a character on the British TV series The Innocence Project"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Jon Ford||||1995\u20131996||19||0||"]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["| || ||Jon Ford || "]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Six other players joined the club prior to the start of the new season, four of whom incurred a transfer fee.
