In 1991, Soundtracks decided to focus on his own songwriting career, and began the series of recordings that comprised his three solo records. As a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist he released three critically acclaimed solo albums, and two more were released posthumously.Notable fans of Soundtracks' solo work include Evan Dando and Thurston Moore. Dave Graney paid tribute to Soundtracks with the song \"A Boy Named Epic\" on The Royal Dave Graney Show's 2003 album The Brother Who Lived.  Arthur Lee's backing band, Baby Lemonade, paid tribute as well, with a song off their 2001 High Life Suite LP called,\"Song for Epic\".Epic Soundtracks died in his sleep on 6 November 1997, at his flat in West Hampstead, London.
