Making his debut on  10 March 1973 against Sheffield United his first goal came in the next game, his home debut, a 2\u20131 home win against Manchester City. The following season was a poor one for MacDougall at West Ham and his confidence as a player suffered. He scored only one goal and was sent-off on 6 October 1973 for attacking Burnley player, Doug Collins. A dressing-room punch-up with Billy Bonds following a 4\u20131 defeat, on 3 November 1973, to Leeds United curtailed his stint at the London club. MacDougall had scored the only West Ham goal of the game but Bonds had criticised his effort and the two  fought in the dressing-room. Manager Ron Greenwood had been aware of the incident and had allowed it to continue. It was his last goal for West Ham. He played only four more games, his last in December 1973."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Doug Collins||||MF||1963\u20131968||103||9"]}, {"page": "Doug Collins", "response": ["Douglas or Doug Collins may refer to:", "* Doug Collins (basketball) (born 1951), American basketball executive and former player, coach, and sports analyst", "* Doug Collins (Canadian football) (born 1945), Canadian football player", "* Doug Collins (footballer) (born 1945), English former footballer", "* Doug Collins (journalist) (1920\u20132001), Canadian journalist and Holocaust denier", "* Doug Collins (politician) (born 1966), former U.S. Representative"]}]}}
