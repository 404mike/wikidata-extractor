He played representative football for Brierley Hill Schools before joining Birmingham City when he left school in 1962. He turned professional two years later, and made his debut in the Second Division on 31 December 1966 in a 3\u20133 draw away to Norwich City. Ray Martin had been injured for some weeks, and Isherwood played at right back to allow Martin's regular deputy Bert Murray to switch to the left in place of the unavailable Colin Green. He had a run of four games in similar circumstances later that season, and scored the winning goal against Hull City in the first of these, but Martin's return to fitness pushed him down the pecking order. In 1968, he moved into non-league football with Bromsgrove Rovers and later played for Kidderminster Harriers.After retiring from football, Isherwood took up tennis. He went on to win local doubles titles and has played for Hereford and Worcester county over-55s team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dennis Isherwood", "response": ["Dennis Isherwood may refer to:", "* Dennis Isherwood (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20131974), English footballer with Chester", "* Dennis Isherwood (footballer, born 1947) (born 1947), English footballer with Birmingham City"]}, {"page": "Dennis Isherwood (footballer born 1947)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dennis Isherwood (footballer, born 1947)"]}]}}
