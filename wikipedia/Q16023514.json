He was born in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire and died in Uckfield. He appeared in 145 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm slow. He scored 6,226 runs with a highest score of 187 among six centuries and took 26 wickets with a best performance of four for 19.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Gilligan", "response": ["Gilligan played for Sussex throughout the 1921 season and according to Wisden \"made a distinct advance\". His batting record was similar to the previous season, although he increased his number of wickets in the season to 90 at an average of 30.64. Wisden notes that his bowling was not statistically good, but that his biggest impact came in fielding, which was \"brilliant in the extreme. He was described on all hands as the best mid-off in England.\" In 1922, Gilligan assumed the Sussex captaincy from Herbert Wilson. The team's results were not impressive, but Wisden said that the team were attractive to watch and excelled in fielding, in which Gilligan led by example. Gilligan later recalled that he received great support from George Cox, the senior professional in the team.Marshall, p. 73. Personally, Gilligan had his best season to date with bat and ball; he scored 916 runs and took 135 wickets at an average of 18.75. Based on his good form, he was selected in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Appearing for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, his fielding in particular impressed commentators. He was selected in a further representative match, when he played for the \"Rest of England\" against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the latter game, he took eight wickets in total. At the end of the season, Gilligan was included in the MCC team to tour South Africa and play a Test series."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Herbert Wilson 42*"]}, {"page": "Herbert Wilson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Herbert Wilson (1929\u20132008) was a British physicist.", "Herbert Wilson may also refer to:", "*Herbert Wilson (Sussex cricketer) (1881\u20131937), English cricketer", "*Herbert Wilson (Nottinghamshire cricketer) (1892\u20131972), English cricketer", "*Herbert Wilson (footballer) (1893\u20131956), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Herbert Wilson (1920)"]}, {"page": "Francis Wilson (English cricketer)", "response": ["Born in Cottesbrooke, a small Northamptonshire village, Wilson was the oldest of three cricketing brothers, each of whom played for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship.Francis Wilson playing statistics \u2013 CricketArchive.
