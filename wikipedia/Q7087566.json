Goodwill also works in a band called \"Melessa Jean\", as a songwriter and drummer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard III (2007 film)", "response": ["* Oliver Goodwill as York Subordinate"]}, {"page": "Call Me When You're Sober", "response": ["An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Marc Webb and filmed in Hollywood; it draws inspiration from the fairy tale \"Little Red Riding Hood\". It features British actor Oliver Goodwill as the Big Bad Wolf, trying to seduce Lee. The video was noted to contain metaphorical undertones as opposed to the song's literal lyrics. \"Call Me When You're Sober\" was part of the set lists during three of Evanescence's worldwide tours; The Open Door Tour (2006\u201307), the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312) and the band's fourth worldwide tour (2016\u201317). It has been covered by American Idol contestant Gina Glocksen and used in several video games, including Rock Band.", "In the video, Lee plays Little Red Riding Hood while actor Oliver Goodwill plays the Big Bad Wolf, who tries to seduce her. The clip begins with Lee at a vanity wearing a red satin cape, lip-syncing to the lyrics while sitting at opposite ends of a dining table with her lover played by Goodwill. She is then shown standing in front of a mirror while her lover comes behind her; he starts caressing her shoulders and prepares to kiss her, but Lee refuses and pulls away from him. Shots of the band playing the song together and Lee sitting among wolves are interspersed among other scenes of the video. During the song's bridge, Lee appears descending a staircase, backed by four back-up dancers dressed in black clothing; upon reaching the bottom, both Lee and the dancers start levitating in the air. At the end of the song, Lee is seen walking atop the length of the dining table, while chairs and tabletop items are flung aside as she passes. She reaches her lover at the other end of the table, places her finger on his lips, and sings \"I've made up your mind\", indicating that he should start packing his things and leave. The video ends with Lee giggling behind the piano."]}, {"page": "Goodwill, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Goodwill"]}]}}
