In 1837 he wrote his handbook of Christian Evidences, which was translated during his lifetime into more than a dozen languages.

This choice began a period of divisive moves. The resolution of synod (June 1825) in his favour, though cautiously worded, was a straw in the wind. At the outset Cooke fought against the odds, if with allies in Robert Stewart of Broughshane, and most of the laity was with him. Among the orthodox ministers an important moderate section, led by James Carlile, looked without favour upon Cooke's policy. The leader of the Arian opposition to Cooke in the synod was Henry Montgomery."]}]}}
