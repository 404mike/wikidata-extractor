He was born at Dalhousie in British India and died at Bengeo, Hertfordshire.\nTaylor was the son of General Reynell Taylor and was educated at Newton College in Devon and at Jesus College, Cambridge. Arriving at Cambridge in 1894, he was picked and awarded a Blue for The Varsity Match rugby game against Oxford University in his first year, and again in 1896, appearing as a wing three-quarter back. His first-class cricket career as a right-handed middle-order batsman was all over within a week, and consisted of two matches for Cambridge University Cricket Club, both won by Cambridge by an innings, which meant that he had just two first-class innings and in them he made only three runs.Taylor graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897. He became a schoolmaster, initially in Leamington, and then at Elstree School but left in 1901 to join the Paget's Horse regiment for the Second Boer War. Invalided home, he resumed his educational career as a master at Bengeo school, but died from pneumonia a year later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Taylor", "response": ["Henry Taylor may refer to:", "* Henry Taylor (artist) (born 1958), American artist", "* Henry Taylor (dramatist) (1800\u20131886), English dramatist", "* Henry Taylor (organist) (1859\u2013?), English organist and composer", "* Henry Taylor (priest) (1711\u20131785), Church of England priest and religious controversialist", "* Henry Taylor (politician) (1872/3\u20131957), Unionist politician in Northern Ireland", "* Henry Taylor (boxer) (born 1914), U.S. boxer", "* Henry Taylor (racing driver) (1932\u20132013), British race car driver", "* Henry Taylor (swimmer) (1885\u20131951), British long-distance swimmer", "* Henry Taylor (cricketer, born 1856) (1856\u20131896), British cricketer", "* Henry Taylor (cricketer, born 1822) (1822\u20131901), English cricketer", "* Henry Taylor (cricketer, born 1875) (1875\u20131903), Indian-born English sportsman", "* Henry Taylor (American football) (born 1975), American football player", "* Henry Taylor (rugby union, born 1858) (1858\u20131942), English rugby union international", "* Henry Taylor (rugby union, born 1994), English rugby union scrum-half", "* Henry Taylor (carpenter) (1823\u20131891), Wilmington NC based carpenter and builder", "* Henry Taylor (trade unionist), British trade union leader", "* Henry Taylor (24 character), character on the television series 24"]}]}}
