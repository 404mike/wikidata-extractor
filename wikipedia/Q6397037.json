By this time, all but the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands were still active \u2013 Austin had already been dropped in 1987, because it was felt by Graham Day's new management that many of the other marque names within the former BL had been tarnished by their association with the poor quality cars of the 1970s. The strategy going forward, therefore, was to concentrate on the upmarket Rover brand instead."]}, {"page": "St Mary's College, Crosby", "response": ["* Kevin Morley, businessman and former MD of Rover Group"]}, {"page": "Alchemy Partners", "response": ["Alchemy came to public notice in 1999, when it was negotiating to buy Rover Group from BMW; its advisory board members included former Rover MD Kevin Morley.
