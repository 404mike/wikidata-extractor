He did much to combat piracy in the waters of the Straits Settlements.\nBorn in Leith on 23 March 1796, Congalton ran away from home in a collier but was found by his brother and brought home. He then became a gunner on a ship bound for Calcutta. He went on from there to Penang and became widely known as Captain Congalton. He became master of the paddle steamer Diana, an armed cruiser, when it was bought for use by Singapore in 1837.\nHe never married, and died in Penang in April 1850.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diana (1823)", "response": ["Diana steamed to Singapore on 28 February 1836. Johnston & Co. advertised her for sale. The East India Company purchased her in March 1837 and appointed Samuel Congalton her captain. Dianas establishment consisted of her captain, two European officers and thirty Malays. In the East India Company's service Diana suppressed piracy and conducted maritime surveys. Congalton remained her captain until 1845 when he became captain of her replacement, the Hooghly. Diana appears to have been sold off and renamed Eliza Penelope."]}, {"page": "Congalton", "response": ["*Samuel Congalton (1796\u20131850), Scottish sailor"]}]}}
