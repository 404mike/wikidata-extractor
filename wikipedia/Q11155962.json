Cupitt himself became a miner. He played for Derbyshire in the 1892 season and in the 1893 season when the club was outside the championship. Twelve years later in the 1905 season he made his first-class debut, against Essex in May. He took one wicket in the match, that of future Test cricketer Claude Buckenham, though Derbyshire lost the match by an innings margin, in part thanks to a first-class best 277 runs from Charlie McGahey. His second and final first-class appearance came the following month, against Northamptonshire, against whom, he took two wickets but scored just a single run in two innings.\nCupitt was a left-arm medium-pace bowler and took three first-class wickets at an average of 48.33 and a best performance of 2 for 24. He batted in four innings in two first-class matches at an average of 9.5 and a top score of 13.Cupitt died in South Kirkby, Yorkshire at the age of 64.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1905", "response": ["The most significant addition to the Derbyshire squad in the season was George Buckston who though playing only one match in the 1905 season went on to become captain.
