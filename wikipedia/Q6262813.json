Nevertheless, Hills retained a close connection with his wife's family after her death, including her half-sisters Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell. Woolf professed to dislike him, comparing his appearance to that of \"an excellent highly polished well seasoned brown boot.\"During World War I he served as a captain in the 4th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. He was promoted to the rank of Major in October 1915 and Acting Lieutenant-Colonel of the 20th Battalion in July 1916. He was wounded in September 1916, and mentioned in dispatches.\nHe was Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for City of Durham from 1906 to 1918 and for the successor Durham City Division from 1918 to 1922, and Conservative member for Ripon from December 1925, following his victory in the by-election. He held ministerial office as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1922 to 1923.\nIn 1923, he was appointed by the government to the board of what would become Imperial Airways.He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1929. He was due to be conferred a baronetcy in the 1939 New Year Honours but died before he could receive it. His five-year-old son Andrew Ashton Waller Hills was created a baronet, of Hills Court in the County of Kent, in his stead, whilst his wife was granted the style, title and place of the widow of a baronet. She was also active in politics, but for the Liberal party, standing for parliament at Hendon North in 1959.
