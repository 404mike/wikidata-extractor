Undertones songs written by John O'Neill include the singles \"Teenage Kicks\", \"Jimmy Jimmy\", \"Here Comes The Summer\" and \"You've Got My Number\", and such notable album tracks as \"When Saturday Comes\" and \"You're Welcome\".\nAfter releasing four albums and thirteen singles, The Undertones disbanded in 1983; they reformed in November 1999. Since then, the band (who have a new lead singer, fellow Derry native Paul McLoone who also serves as a radio presenter for the Irish national and independent radio station Today FM) have released two further albums and performed a number of gigs in both the UK, Ireland, Europe and North America.\nIn 1985 the O'Neill brothers formed That Petrol Emotion, an acclaimed rock act who disbanded in 1994.\nIn the 1990s he formed a trip hop group called Rare under the stage name Se\u00e1n \u00d3'N\u00e9ill with vocalist Mary Gallagher.

Charismatic Seattle-born American singer Steve Mack (at the time, on a year out from his studies and working in a pizzeria in London) completed the lineup.Band biography on That Petrol Emotion homepage (hosted on the Wayback Machine) In 2020, comedian Paul Whitehouse revealed that he had unsuccessfully auditioned for the band during this period.", "That Petrol Emotion's influences encompassed artists as diverse as The Beatles, Afrika Bambaataa, Television, Sly & the Family Stone, Captain Beefheart and Can. Following some initial interest from Creation Records, they released their debut single \"Keen\" on Pink Records in July 1985. The sound of the new band severed overt musical links with The Undertones due to its darker, more edgy sound: That Petrol Emotion were also far more political and outspoken than The Undertones had been, with the Irish members listing their names in their Irish language forms on the sleeve art and (in their songwriting) beginning to look into issues relating to the Irish Troubles. O'Gorman would later describe the band as having been \"like the Undertones after discovering drugs, literature and politics, with a lot more girls in the audience dancing.\" As with The Undertones, John O'Neill emerged as principal songwriter (although songwriting contributions were made by all group members).", "On the eve of the recording sessions for the third That Petrol Emotion album, End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues, John O'Neill announced his imminent departure from the band. Although he stayed to record the album, the sessions were fraught with tension and foreboding. O'Gorman has recalled \"it was a complete bombshell. When I look back now, we should have thrown him out there and then and got on with the new recording ourselves. Instead we meekly accepted everything and he hung around for another three or four months. It was a toxic situation.\"", "Having completed tour dates to promote the album, John O'Neill left That Petrol Emotion in October 1988. Following his departure, a reshuffle took place in the band. Drummer Ciaran McLaughlin and guitarist Raymond Gorman picked up major songwriting duties (blossoming as writers in the process) whilst John Marchini (who had covered on guitar for an ailing Gorman on some of the tour dates) joined on bass guitar to allow Damian O'Neill to take up the guitar alongside Gorman. This new dynamic of musicians and songsmiths led to the 1990 album Chemicrazy, produced by Scott Litt. Working with Litt, the band developed a more alt rock style than before, as hinted at on the final track of the previous album \"Under the Sky\". Although the album's song were more intense than previous work, Chemicrazy also maintained a pure pop heart, exemplified by singles \"Sensitize\", \"Tingle\" and \"Hey Venus\" (the former track sounding particularly R.E.M-esque). Frustratingly for the band, however, the massive predicted sales for Chemicrazy never happened. The album stalled at UK number 62 and its disappointing performance led to the end of the band's contract with Virgin Records.", "Following the band's breakup, drummer Ciaran McLaughlin played jazz for a while\"A whole lot of Everlasting Yeah!
