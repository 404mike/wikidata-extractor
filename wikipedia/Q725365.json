He was the 1964 Olympic champion in the event. He was born  in Nantymoel near Bridgend and was a member of the Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club.Davies won an Olympic gold medal in the long jump in 1964 with a mark of 8.07 metres (26 ft 6 in), earning himself the nickname \"Lynn the Leap\". He finished ninth in 1968, having been flag bearer at the opening ceremony. In 1964 he also competed in the 100 metres and 4\u00d7100 metres contests. He was 18th in the 1972 Olympic long jump, his selection being something of a surprise at the time.Outside the Olympics, Davies was the 1966 European champion in the long jump and was the silver medallist three years later. He was also twice the Commonwealth Games champion, winning titles in 1966 and 1970 (becoming the first man to win that title two times).Davies was twice a winner of the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year award, taking the honour in 1964 and 1966. After retiring from competitions in 1973 he became technical director of Canadian athletics until 1976 and later prepared the British team for the Moscow Olympics. Davies was created a CBE on 17 June 2006, having previously received an MBE in 1967. He was elected unopposed as President of the UK Athletics Members Council for a further four years following the close of nominations.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 20", "response": ["*  1942   \u2013 Lynn Davies, Welsh sprinter and long jumper"]}, {"page": "1942", "response": ["** Lynn Davies, Welsh track and field athlete"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Lynn Davies (born 1942), Olympic gold medallist "]}, {"page": "Yate", "response": ["An eight-lane track was completed in December 1988 and formally opened by Olympian, Lynn Davies in 1989."]}, {"page": "Bob Beamon", "response": ["Beamon entered the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as the favorite to win the gold medal, having won 22 of the 23 meets he had competed in that year, including a career best of 8.33\u00a0m (equivalent to 27\u00a0feet 4 inches) and a world's best of 8.39 m  that was ineligible for the record books due to excessive wind assistance. That year he won the AAU and NCAA indoor long jump and triple jump titles, as well as the AAU outdoor long jump title. He came close to missing the Olympic final, overstepping on his first two attempts in qualifying. With only one chance left, Beamon re-measured his approach run from a spot in front of the board and made a fair jump that advanced him to the final. There he faced the two previous gold-medal winners, fellow American Ralph Boston (1960) and Lynn Davies of Great Britain (1964), and twice bronze medallist Igor Ter-Ovanesyan of the Soviet Union.", "On October 18, Beamon set a world record for the long jump with a first jump of 8.90\u00a0m , bettering the existing record by 55\u00a0cm . When the announcer called out the distance for the jump, Beamon\u2014unfamiliar with metric measurements\u2014still did not realize what he had done. When his teammate and coach Ralph Boston told him that he had broken the world record by nearly two feet, his legs gave way and an astonished and overwhelmed Beamon suffered a brief cataplexy attack brought on by the emotional shock, and collapsed to his knees, his body unable to support itself, placing his hands over his face. The defending Olympic champion Lynn Davies told Beamon, \"You have destroyed this event\", and in sports jargon, a new adjective \u2013 Beamonesque \u2013 came into use to describe spectacular feats.IOC Athlete Profile, \u2013 \"His achievement inspired a new word in the English language: Beamonesque, meaning an athletic feat so dramatically superior to previous feats that it overwhelms the imagination.\""]}, {"page": "Cyncoed", "response": ["As well as a modern hall of residence for Cardiff University, in 1961 the Cardiff College of Education providing teacher training opened.

He attended Nunthorpe Secondary School, where he still holds many of its year group records for triple and long jump, before attending Prior Pursglove College in Guisborough. In his early teens Chris decided to concentrate on long jump.  His major breakthrough came in 2002 when, just three months after breaking both wrists in a freak weight-training accident, he jumped 8.27 m to break the British record that had been held by Lynn Davies for 34 years. On 7 July 2007 he increased his record by a further 2\u00a0cm, jumping  while competing in Bad Langensalza in Germany."]}, {"page": "Superstars (British TV programme)", "response": ["In the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight boxing champion John Conteh comfortably beat an ill Hemery and Colin Bell to win the title, again at Crystal Palace. Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the competition with increasing his abilities as a boxer, the inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country's \"top sportsman\" and also provided an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and Lynn Davies) could extend their careers.\"Superstars: Best of the Best\" BBC DVD, 2003", "There was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new \"Past Masters\" event for competitors over 35, which was won by Lynn Davies, the 1964 Olympic Long Jump champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka Brian Jacks, who became Britain's most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.", "To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off \"Challenge of the Champions\" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two \"Past Masters\" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.", "The key had been his ability to score well throughout \u2013 he was second in the steeplechase for instance \u2013 and even losing his 'banker' (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was a new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Lynn Davies", "*After each event, the competitor who is ranked first gains 10 points, the next best ranked gets 7, then 4, 2 and then finally 1 point. These points are then totalled up to give a total out of 80 (from a maximum of eight events). Lynn Davies won seven of his eight events in the 1979 UK Past Masters contest and scored 70 points (a record).", "The third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of Freeport, Bahamas.  Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion.  The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane.  The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury.  If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying.  Completing the line-up were two invited challengers \u2013 not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though.  Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septi\u00e9n to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success.  They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America.  They would have little impact on the final.", "That was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process.  He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time.  While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd's consistency.  Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests.  In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth."]}, {"page": "Davies", "response": ["* Charles Lynn Davies, Wales rugby player", "* Lynn Davies, British athlete"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Metropolitan University", "response": ["* Lynn Davies \u2013 Olympic Gold Medallist"]}]}}
