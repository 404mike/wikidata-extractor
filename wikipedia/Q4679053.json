He won the British Hillclimb Championship in both 2003 and 2004 driving a Gould GR55 (650BHP), and in the latter year won an unprecedented 28 of the 34 rounds of the series. In the process he broke all but one outright hill records, and became the first driver to complete the Shelsley Walsh course in under 24 seconds. However, his main rival, Graeme Wight Jr, did not compete at all (one or two guest appearances in other cars aside) in the second half of the 2004 season. As he was awaiting completion of a new car, which did not become available by the end of the season.Before making the step up to the top category of hillclimbing, Fleetwood had previously competed with distinction in smaller-engined single-seater cars, setting several class records in the process.\nIn April 2005, Fleetwood announced that family and other commitments (such as his preparation for competing in the British Porsche Carerra Cup) would preclude his appearance in the rest of that season's championship, although in the event he did compete in a small number of climbs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Hill Climb Championship", "response": ["An extra point is given to any driver in the run-off who breaks the outright hill record as it stood at the beginning of the day. There are usually 34 such run-offs (i.e. 17 hillclimbs with two run-offs at each), but drivers can only count their 28 best results towards their final points total. In 2004, Adam Fleetwood achieved the unprecedented feat of winning 28 rounds, and so had to drop all his non-win points. Even so, he won the championship by a huge margin - before taking account of his dropped scores, he had racked up 318 points, with the runner-up, 1997 champion Roger Moran, a massive distance behind on 176 points.", "A little later in the decade, once Adam Fleetwood had proved that he could translate his exploits in smaller cars to the top class, Wight Jr began to come under intense pressure, and by 2004 Fleetwood usually had the better of their battles. Sadly that season's championship was robbed of a classic battle for the title when Wight Jr pulled out in June to wait for the arrival of a new car - this had still not been driven in anger by the end of the year. However, crowds around the country could console themselves by watching a true master of the hills at work. Fleetwood won all but six of the year's 34 BHCC rounds, breaking hill records for fun - and in turn became the first person to climb Shelsley in under 24 seconds.", "| 2004 || Adam Fleetwood || Gould GR55 NME", "| 2003 || Adam Fleetwood || Gould GR55 NME"]}, {"page": "Graeme Wight Jr.", "response": ["He was runner-up to Adam Fleetwood in 2003, but after that things started to go wrong for Graeme. He was Fleetwood's main rival in the first part of the 2004 season, but delays in the appearance of his new car meant that he barely competed after mid-June and could manage only eighth place in the championship. Continued development problems in 2005 meant that he was never in the running in that season's championship and only rarely qualified for the run-offs. He was also absent from the 2006 championship, but still hopes to return to competition."]}, {"page": "Barbon Hillclimb", "response": ["| British Hill Climb Championship : Adam Fleetwood"]}, {"page": "2005 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain", "response": ["|  Adam Fleetwood", "|align=left|  Adam Fleetwood"]}, {"page": "Fleetwood (surname)", "response": ["* Adam Fleetwood, British racing driver"]}, {"page": "Fleetwood, Adam", "response": ["#redirectAdam Fleetwood"]}]}}
