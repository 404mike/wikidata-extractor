However his career was then interrupted by National Service and he did not make his debut until January 1954. He began his career as a winger but played mainly as an inside forward and could also play at centre forward. Over the following four seasons Berry was a regular in the Palace first team making a total of 151 League appearances, scoring 27 times. In May 1958, Berry was signed, together with Palace colleague Jimmy Belcher for Ipswich Town, by then manager Alf Ramsay. However, in September 1959, Berry suffered an injury which would ultimately end his career and he retired as a result of this in June 1961, after 38 appearances (6 goals) for Ipswich."]}, {"page": "Belcher (surname)", "response": ["* Jimmy Belcher (born 1932), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Future Nottingham Central MP Jack Dunnett joined the board in July 1961 and took over as chairman from Frank Davis three months later. For the first time since relegation to the Third Division South in 1953, Brentford conducted an end-of-season clearout in a bid to reduce the squad size and wage bill. Ken Horne, Billy Goundry, George Bristow, Dennis Heath and Eric Parsons, who had each made over 100 appearances for the club, were released, as were five other bit-part players. Most galling for the Brentford supporters was the sale of forwards Jim Towers and George Francis (who had accounted for 299 goals between them since 1954) to divisional and local rivals Queens Park Rangers for a combined \u00a38,000 fee. \u00a36,000 Cardiff City forward Brian Edgley was signed as a replacement and Ray Reeves and Jimmy Belcher were brought in to strengthen the back lines. The signings took the squad size to just 16 players, six of whom held a part-time status (Cakebread, Dargie, Gelson, Gitsham, Reeves and Ryecraft) and of those, two (Gelson and Ryecraft) were juniors who had yet to make their senior debuts. In addition, assistant trainer Jack Holliday (the club's record goalscorer) was sacked and trainer Fred Monk resigned in April 1962.", "|Jimmy Belcher", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jimmy Belcher", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jimmy Belcher", "| Jimmy Belcher", "| Jimmy Belcher"]}]}}
