Ltd and mainly draws for The Beano and The Dandy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Beano", "response": ["Plots and dialogue are written into a script by an (often) uncredited DC Thomson writer, a formerly common practice for DC Thomson magazines. Uncredited artists assigned to a strip(s) will design all its stories into a \"series\" that the chief editor will arrange into an order to publish for each issue. Strips are sometimes ghostwritten by other artists who imitate the original designer's style, which is helpful if artists retire or die unexpectedly, otherwise the strip is discontinued. \"When I started I was drawing two pages a week and thinking 'Phew, that's quite a lot'. Now I do 10 or 12 pages a week. You have to do more all the time to stay where you are,\" explained Nigel Parkinson.  From March 2016, authors and illustrators are now credited in issues.", "Stu Munro also took over as both puzzle page artist (as he did in The Dandy) and The Dandy's Madvertisements were brought back with Stu Munro once again drawing them. Since the 75th Anniversary Special revamp, The Beano has now gained Andy Fanton, from The Dandy and the original Beano artists that remain in the comic are David Sutherland, Laura Howell, Nigel Parkinson, Hunt Emerson and Barrie Appleby, as Barry Glennard and Dave Eastbury appear to have gone."]}, {"page": "Roger the Dodger", "response": ["2012: Appleby resumes drawing Roger after Nigel Parkinson takes over Dennis and Gnasher."]}, {"page": "The Bash Street Kids", "response": ["By 2000 The Bash Street Kids was a feature-length strip, filling an entire Beano book. Often drawn by Mike Pearce and Kev F. Sutherland, during the late 2000s the strips moved to Beano sister publication BeanoMAX (where they were drawn by Nigel Parkinson). These feature-length strips were more detailed, delving into an obscure character's personality and introducing new traits. Spotty was revealed as sarcastic and aggressive, while Plug was a more sympathetic, emotional character. The strips detailed a rivalry between the kids and the comic's cover star, Dennis the Menace. Mike Pearce soon began penciling a spin-off from the original strip, The Bash Street Kids \u2013 Singled Out, a single-page comic concentrating on one \"kid\" a week. Pearce retired, the strips were taken over by Tom Paterson before being mothballed and they were later collected into two annuals.", "Leo Baxendale drew the strip until 1962, when David Sutherland replaced him. Sutherland originally used a similar drawing style to Baxendale's, simplifying it later in the decade. He has drawn most of the strips since then, except from 1998 to 2000 (when Nigel Parkinson took over the strip in a style similar to that of David Parkins in Dennis the Menace.) The strips have had a closely connected visual style since the early 1970s, when Sutherland began drawing them both. Although he was apparently easing into semi-retirement, Parkinson moved to Dennis the Menace in 2000 and Sutherland returned."]}, {"page": "Harry Hill", "response": ["In November 2010, Hill released his debut comic album, 'Funny Times'. The album was preceded by the singles 'I Wanna Baby', 'SuBo', and 'Ken!', which features William Roache, as his Coronation Street character, Ken Barlow, is the feature of the song. Since October 2010, Hill has had his own comic strip in The Dandy, entitled Harry Hill's Real Life Adventures in TV Land, drawn by Nigel Parkinson. Hill was directly involved in its creation and is co-credited with Parkinson. Between October and December 2010, Hill starred in a weekly online comedy series on the ChannelFlip website, entitled Harry Hill's Little Internet Show. Ten episodes of the show were broadcast online."]}, {"page": "Pup Parade", "response": ["From June 2011, reprints appeared in The Beano, and then replaced by new stories, illustrated by Nigel Parkinson. Short strips featured in Funsize Funnies, but Lew Stringer became the new author and illustrator after 2014.", "The Pup Parade also made a return in the Bash Street Kids Annual 2008. They appeared again in a talent contest in the 2012 Beano Annual, which Sniffy won. This strip was titled as The Bash Street Dogs and was drawn by Nigel Parkinson."]}, {"page": "Ball Boy (Beano)", "response": ["The strip was drawn by Malcolm Judge until his death in 1989. John Dallas took over from him afterwards, and drew it until his retirement in April 2003. Since then, the artist has been Dave Eastbury. Nigel Parkinson and Tom Paterson both occasionally draw the strip as well. In issue 3,481 (2 May 2009) a John Dallas reprint was used.", "Ball Boy also features in The BeanoMAX comic, drawn in the black and blue vertical striped kit, by Nigel Parkinson. This was explained in a March 2007 Beano. Ball Boy's Mum accidentally washed the kits with a blue garment, and it dyed the red stripes dark blue. But the team, who'd complained they needed new kits, were happy, so BB didn't admit what had happened. This strip was drawn by regular artist Dave Eastbury.  In 2008, Ball Boy's teammates went off on holiday, leaving him needing a new team for a Beanotown Summer League Championship. This team included \u2013 Ball Boy, Ronald Osbourne (who has a wealthy mother), Chandra Singh (who is the team's most skilled player), Lily, an unnamed goalkeeper and a kid who has hair hidden over his face. They also now have a proper name \u2013 'Beanotown Juniors'.  Ball Boy himself did not score any goals until the final match in this story arc."]}, {"page": "Totally Gross Germs", "response": ["The strip was originally drawn by David Sutherland, and was taken over by Vic Neill later on. Around this time Will's name was added onto the title, the wording changing every so often, such as including (also featuring Ill Will), (also starring Ill Will) or (with Ill Will). Due to Neill's work on Billy Whizz and Tim Traveller, the strip appeared on an increasingly irregular basis in the late 1990s, and after Neill's death in 2000, it disappeared from The Beano. In 2004 it briefly returned with a new artist, Nigel Parkinson. However, the strip only made three appearances which were spread over the year, and was dropped once again."]}, {"page": "Minnie the Minx", "response": ["Ken Harrison drew his last Minnie the Minx strip in November 2012, drawing the first Minnie story reduced down to a single page. The week after, Nigel Parkinson took over and both wrote and drew the strip from then on. He confirmed he was the new Minnie artist some months later, on his blog. For the 75th anniversary special, Minnie the Minx met Andy Murray in a tennis battle. Minnie also met Harry Hill, Jeremy Clarkson and Matt Smith (plus others) in the 2013 Comic Relief special. During Parkinson's time he tried to surprise the readers by never following a script template and allowing Minnie's character to dictate storylines. In 2013, Minnie stories went back up to two pages, with Nigel Parkinson and Paul Palmer and, later in 2015, Cavan Scott writing the scripts."]}, {"page": "Bea (Dennis the Menace)", "response": ["In issue 2935, Bea starred in Beaginnings drawn by Nigel Parkinson. It was about her misbehaviour at home, saying her first word (\"mud\") and playing with her older brother's pets. The title changed to Dennis's Little Sister Bea \u2013 the Mini-Menace from issue 3099, but was also known as Bea. She shares notable similarities with fellow Beano character, Ivy the Terrible, who, from August 2008, joined Bea in her strip, renamed Bea and Ivy. Nigel Parkinson continued as artist, as Ivy had been reprinted before the team up.", "Bea's own strip returned for a few issues in 2009, however, this was dropped later that year, mainly due to her older brother's relaunch. In 2010 Bea joined up with Gnipper and Harley, Gran's pet pig, in a new strip titled The Bea Team, the title being a parody of The A-Team film which was released around the time the strip was in The Beano. In 2014, Bea returned to her strip drawn by Nigel Parkinson."]}, {"page": "Lord Snooty", "response": ["Issue 3439 introduced Lord Snooty the Third, illustrated by Nigel Parkinson. It stars a mischievous boy who lives in a castle, establishing this by showing him jetskiing on Lake Snooty. Although it was originally entered as part of the New Bash Street Kid competition, the following issue reveals this new character is Marmaduke's grandson, showing a distinctive and recognisable \"Grandad\" in the family portrait gallery. Later on, Snooty the Third became a spy, parodying James Bond."]}]}}
