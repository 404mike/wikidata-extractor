Some contemporary sources called them \"Earls of Clare\", but many modern historians treat this as if it were a \"styled\" (self-assumed) title. There was no standardised method of reference to earls in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the Clares were one of a handful referred to as earls in this period without a county mentioned. For example, Gerald of Wales recounts an incident relating to the Earl of Clare, possibly referring to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester.Gerald of Wales, The Journey through Wales, trans. Lewis Thorpe (Penguin Classics, 1978), p. 142. Such references led some older historians to assume the Earls of Gloucester and Hertford also carried the title Earls of Clare. The title, for instance, is given in the original Dictionary of National Biography. The confusion probably stems from misinterpretation of references, such as that of \"Earl Gilbert de Clare\", in which Clare was taken as a title rather than a surname. One view is there was no such title in existence,For example, Michael Altschul, \u2018Clare, Richard de, sixth earl of Gloucester and fifth earl of Hertford (1222\u20131262)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 , accessed 23 Oct 2009. and that the first creation of the title Earl of Clare dates to 1624.Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, Reissued by READ Books, 2008  However, John Burke in 1831 states that prior to the 1624 creation, Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick, was to be created Earl of Clare, but that it was refused by the crown lawyers, \"on a solemn declaration, that it was a title peculiar to the royal blood and not to be conferred upon a subject.\""]}, {"page": "Landed gentry", "response": ["In the 1830s, one peerage publisher, John Burke, expanded his market and his readership by publishing a similar volume for people without titles, which was called A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank, popularly known as Burke's Commoners.
