It was revealed that Walsh was already calling them Westlife before the Westside name came along. In Westlife \u2013 Our Story, Byrne revealed that, unlike the others in the group, he was keen to change the name to West High. McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan to facilitate signing autographs. They managed to secure a major record deal the second time around under BMG with all other record labels competed. They have signed a four million pound record deal with RCA Records. Westlife's first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and Backstreet Boys' concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. Later, they won a special Smash Hits Roadshow award at that year's Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. Their first live television performance as a group in Ireland and worldwide was on the Irish TV series and the world's second longest-running late-night talk show, The Late Late Show that had its broadcast on 13 November 1998. They performed \"Flying Without Wings\". The band then released an EP titled Swear It Again afterwards. Both recorded songs under Westside were produced by Steve Mac and written by Mac and Wayne Hector. Cowell chose the debut extended play and single with the guidance of his father, Eric Cowell, who stated then, \"I think they will be big\"."]}, {"page": "Shannon Noll", "response": ["In early 2005, Noll went on a songwriting trip to the United States and the United Kingdom to work on his second album with Desmond Child, Dianne Warren and Wayne Hector. He later decided not to use any of the material he wrote with Child and also passed on a song by Warren because he preferred his work with local Australian songwriters. Throughout February and March 2005, Noll opened for Bryan Adams on the Australian leg of his Room Service Tour. His second album Lift was released on 16 October 2005, and debuted at number one. The album, with 11 out of 13 tracks co-written by Noll, covered topics including finding love, death, overcoming odds and self belief. It spent nine weeks in the top ten and was certified 3\u00d7 platinum for shipments of 210,000 copies. The lead single \"Shine\" also debuted at number one and was certified platinum. The album's title track and second single    \"Lift\" peaked at number 10 and was certified gold. It was later chosen as the theme song for the Australian version of reality series The Biggest Loser. Two further singles were released from the album, \"Now I Run\" which peaked at number six and \"Lonely\" which peaked at number eight. Noll received two nominations at the 2006 ARIA Music Awards, including Highest Selling Single for \"Shine\" and Best Pop Release for Lift.

In an interview with HitQuarters, Hector said the basic idea for the song came to him while on a break from working on a hip hop session with Ezi Cut in Los Angeles: I came up with a couple of lines for the first verse and then phoned my mama's house, left it on the answering machine, and said, \u201cDon't get rid of this!\u201d\"Interview With Wayne Hector\", HitQuarters, 1 February 2010. Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac. When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that \"this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete.\" According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour. He added, \"Flying Without Wings was a life-changing moment, and a song he says he is particularly proud of. A big moment for me was when Flying Without Wings came out, I\u2019d had a few Number 1s at that point, but that convinced people I could write good pop songs. After that, I started working with bigger acts and over a more diverse range of genres, including country and rock, which helped me pick up some credibility.\" The band's manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for Boyzone's Stephen Gately. \"Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song,\" Walsh recalls. \"I'll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as Simon heard it he just went bananas.
