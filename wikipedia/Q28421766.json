Proctor scored another brace at home to Rochdale, though defensive errors cost Vale a 3\u20132 defeat; captain Tom Conlon, returning from injury, said that \"we started really well and then they have equalised and it has knocked the stuffing out of us\". They picked up their second away win of the season at Swindon Town, with Garrity scoring both the side's goals in a 2\u20131 victory; after the game Clarke thanked the away support but urged critics to \"not make scapegoats of any of our players\". The first home win of the season came against Harrogate Town on 18 September, with David Worrall and James Wilson providing the goals that moved the Vale into the play-offs. A third straight win followed at struggling Scunthorpe United, where Garrity would score the game's only goal. Clarke was nominated for Manager of the Month and Garrity was nominated for Player of the Month; Clarke won the award, the second of his career.", "Clarke attempted to address the injury crisis in the forward roles by signing Ryan Edmondson on loan from Leeds United \u2013 who had spent the first half of the season on loan at Fleetwood Town \u2013 and Kian Harratt on loan from Huddersfield Town. Having failed to break into the first-team, Ryan Johnson was sold on to Stockport County for an undisclosed fee, whilst Danny Amos, Danny Whitehead and Scott Burgess were released. Chris Hussey, a 33-year old defender with 498 career appearances, was signed from Cheltenham Town for an undisclosed fee. The club then signed 28-year old defender Connor Hall from Harrogate Town for an undisclosed fee, whilst Leon Legge was allowed to move in the opposite direction. The club played their first home league fixture in seven weeks on 15 January, losing 3\u20131 to play-off rivals Swindon Town after Covolan was sent off on the stroke of half-time for kicking out at Harry McKirdy; a furious Clarke said that \"he has got to learn from that otherwise he won\u2019t be staying at the club for very long\". A 1\u20130 defeat at home to Salford City made it five defeats in seven league games, though spectators felt Vale were the superior side, whilst the highlight of the game was a tractor being sent on to repair a goalpost after Hall collided with it and broke it. The run of defeats were ended with a goalless draw at Leyton Orient on 22 January, during which Clarke name donly five substitutes due to injury and illnesses to first-team players.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||24||align=\"left\"| Danny Amos", "| 3 September 2021 || LB ||  || Danny Amos || Doncaster Rovers || Free transfer || ", "| 7 January 2022 || LB ||  || Danny Amos || Grimsby Town || Released || "]}, {"page": "List of English football transfers summer 2021", "response": ["| Danny Amos"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 June 2021 || LB ||  || Danny Amos ||  Port Vale || Released || "]}]}}
