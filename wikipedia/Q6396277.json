They managed to beat Tranmere Rovers 3\u20131 in the replay in Burslem. A 'splendid' performance then defeated Notts County 2\u20130. They overcame non-league Macclesfield Town with a Kevin Finney goal to book a Fourth Round home tie with Tottenham Hotspur. Ground improvements increased Vale Park's capacity, though a watered down pitch persuaded \"Spurs\" boss Terry Venables to leave star man Osvaldo Ardiles on the bench. Despite this, TV pundit Jimmy Greaves reckoned that \"The only trouble Spurs will have at Port Vale, is finding the place.\" As it happened 20,045 turned up to witness a 'famous' 2\u20131 victory. The \"Valiants\" were in 'another gear' as Ray Walker nailed a 'stunning' 25 yard strike and Phil Sproson scored the second vital goal. The club received \u00a380,000 for the game from the BBC, with the match also broadcast on radio in Australia. The Fourth Round held Watford, and 22,483 turned up for the original goalless tie in Stoke-on-Trent (the highest Vale Park attendance since the visit of Liverpool in 1964). A further \u00a387,699 was taken from the game.
