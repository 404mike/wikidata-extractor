His career in India was a mixture of military administrative business on the volatile North-West Frontier, and diplomacy and foreign politics advising Maharajas or accompanying the Viceroy in the Princely States.\nAfter leaving the Army, Evans Gordon returned to Britain and in 1900 was elected as Conservative Party MP for Stepney on an anti-alien platform. As a result of the pogroms in Eastern Europe, Jews were arriving in increasing numbers in Britain either to stay, or en route for America. Evans Gordon, as a 'restrictionist', was heavily and actively involved in the passing of the Aliens Act 1905, which sought to limit the number of people allowed to enter Britain, even temporarily. He held Stepney from 1900 to 1907.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 31", "response": ["*1913 \u2013 William Evans-Gordon, English soldier and politician (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["* October 31 \u2013 Sir William Evans-Gordon, British diplomat and politician (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Hay, 9th Marquess of Tweeddale", "response": ["He married twice: firstly in 1857 to Helene Kilmansegge (d.1871) and secondly in 1873 to Julia Mackenzie of Seaforth, daughter of Lt.-Colonel Keith William Stewart-Mackenzie (9 May 1818 \u2013 June 1881)Keith William Stewart at Geneall.net and of Hannah Charlotte Hope Vere.Hannah Hope Vere was the daughter of James Joseph Hope Vere, MP, of Craigie Hall and Blackwood, Midlothian (and grandson of Charles Hope-Weir), and of Lady Elizabeth Hay, daughter of the 7th Marquess of Tweeddale.
