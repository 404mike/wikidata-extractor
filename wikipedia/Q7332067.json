The Hoochie Coochie Men broke up, Baldry and Stewart patched up their differences (and indeed became lifelong friends),Ewbank and Hildred, Rod Stewart: The New Biography, p. 41. and legendary impresario Giorgio Gomelsky put together Steampacket, which featured Baldry, Stewart, Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll, Micky Waller, Vic Briggs and Ricky Fenson; their first appearance was in support of The Rolling Stones in July 1965.Gray, Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary, p. 14. The group was conceived as a white soul revue, analogous to The Ike & Tina Turner Revue, with multiple vocalists and styles ranging from jazz to R & B to blues.Nelson and Bangs, Rod Stewart, p. 61. Steampacket toured with the Stones and The Walker Brothers that summer, ending in the London Palladium; seeing the audience react to the Stones gave Stewart his first exposure to crowd hysteria.Pidgeon, Rod Stewart and the Changing Faces, as quoted in Nelson and Bangs, Rod Stewart, p. 61. Stewart, who had been included in the group upon Baldry's insistence, ended up with most of the male vocal parts. Steampacket was unable to enter the studio to record any material due to its members all belonging to different labels and managers, although Gomelsky did record one of their Marquee Club rehearsals."]}, {"page": "Bill Wyman", "response": ["Wyman's bass sound came not only from his 30-inch short scale fretless bass (the so-called \"homemade\" bass; actually a modified Dallas Tuxedo bass),Jon Sievert interview with Bill Wyman, Guitar Player magazine December (1978) but also from the \"walking bass\" style he adopted, inspired by Willie Dixon and Ricky Fenson. Wyman has played a number of basses, nearly all short scale, including a Framus Star bass and a number of other Framus basses, a Vox Teardrop bass (issued as a Bill Wyman signature model), a Fender Mustang Bass, two Ampeg Dan Armstrong basses, a Gibson EB-3, and a Travis Bean bass. Since the late 1980s, Wyman has primarily played Steinberger basses. In 2011, The Bass Centre in London issued the Wyman Bass, a fretted interpretation of Wyman's first \"homemade\" fretless bass, played and endorsed by Wyman. One of Wyman's basses was the most expensive bass ever sold. His 1969 Fender Mustang Bass sold in an auction for $380,000 in 2020."]}, {"page": "Nicky Hopkins", "response": ["His poor health and repeated surgery later made it difficult for him to tour, and he worked mainly as a session musician for most of his career. Hopkins' studies were interrupted in 1960 when he left school at 16 to become the pianist with Screaming Lord Sutch's Savages until, two years later, he and fellow Savages Bernie Watson, Rick Brown (aka Ricky Fenson) and Carlo Little joined the renowned blues harmonica player Cyril Davies, who had just left Blues Incorporated, and became the Cyril Davies (R&B) All-Stars. Hopkins played piano on their first single, Davies's much-admired theme tune \"Country Line Special\". However, he was forced to leave the All Stars in May 1963 for a series of operations that almost cost him his life and he was bed-ridden for 19 months in his late teenage years. During Hopkins's convalescence Davies died of leukemia and the All Stars disbanded. Hopkins's frail health led him to concentrate on working as a session musician instead of joining bands, although he left his mark performing with a wide variety of famous bands. He quickly became one of London's most in-demand session pianists and performed on many hit recordings from this period."]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Ricky Fenson (The Rolling Stones, Brian Auger and the Trinity, Steampacket)"]}]}}
