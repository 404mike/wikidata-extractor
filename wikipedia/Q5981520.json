He is a left-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler.\nHe made his first-class debut in April 1996 during Yorkshire's preseason tour of Zimbabwe, and in his first innings took 5 for 35 against a Mashonaland Invitation XI. However, the surge in form of Richard Dawson stopped Fisher from progressing with Yorkshire, and he moved to Gloucestershire for the 2002 season. He had a decent summer, scoring over 500 runs and taking more than 30 wickets in first-class cricket; he also scored 103 not out against Essex, which remains his only first-class century.Fisher helped Gloucestershire to promotion to Division One in the County Championship in 2003, but gradually fell away from first-team contention: by 2008 Twenty20 was the only form of the game where he was only playing more than a handful of matches. In 2009, he left Gloucestershire to join Worcestershire, but he was not retained at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["A massive batting effort from Warwickshire compounded with a remarkable second-innings bowling spell from Heath Streak and a spineless Gloucestershire effort in general, saw Warwickshire move to the top of the Division One table.
