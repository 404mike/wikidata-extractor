Brown. Already in the 1920s, Eric John Holmyard criticized the claim of pseudo-Geber being \"new and original\" compared to medieval Islamic alchemy, arguing for direct derivation from Islamic authors.\"[Berthelot] deliberately wanted to underrate J\u0101bir [\u2026], the choice of J\u0101bir\u2019s works made by Berthelot is entirely misleading.\" ", "Holmyard later argued that the then-recent discovery of Jabir's The Book of Seventy diminished the weight of the argument of there being \"no Arabic originals\" corresponding to pseudo-Geber,Makers of Chemistry, by Eric John Holmyard (1931). ", "By 1957, Holmyard was willing to admit that \"the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus\" and that they seemed to be \"the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind\" while still asserting that the author must have been able to read Arabic and most likely worked in Moorish Spain.Eric John Holmyard, Alchemy, 1957, page 134: \"The question at once arises whether the Latin works are genuine translations from the Arabic, or written by a Latin author and, according to common practice, ascribed to Jabir in order to heighten their authority. That they are based on Muslim alchemical theory and practice is not questioned, but the same may be said of most Latin treatises on alchemy of that period; and from various turns of phrase it seems likely that their author could read Arabic. But the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus, and we look in vain in them for any references to the characteristically Jabirian ideas of \"balance\" and the alphabetic numerology. Indeed for their age they have a remarkably matter of fact air about them, theory being stated with a minimum of prolixity and much precise practical detail being given. The general impression they convey is that they are the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind, and a likely guess would be that they were written by a European scholar, possibly in Moorish Spain. Whatever their origin, they became the principal authorities in early Western alchemy and held that position for two or three centuries.\""]}, {"page": "Charles Singer", "response": ["*As editor, A History of Technology (5 vols, between 1954 and 1958), together with Eric John Holmyard and A.
