Political scientist Samuel Finer, writing in 1988, noted that juntas in Latin America tended to be smaller than juntas elsewhere; the median junta had 11 members, while Latin American juntas typically had three or four.  \"Corporate\" military coups have been distinguished from \"factional\" military coups. The former are carried out by the armed forces as an institution, led by senior commanders at the top of the military hierarchy, while the latter are carried out by a segment of the armed forces and are often led by mid-ranking officers.David Kuehn, \"Democratic Control of the Military\" in Handbook of the Sociology of the Military (eds.

The military's administrative, judicial, and/or legislative powers are supported by law, the constitution, and the society. It does not necessarily need to be autocratic or oligarchic by nature in order to preserve its right to rule. The political scientist Samuel Finer distinguished between stratocracy which was rule by the army and military regimes where the army did not rule but enforced the rule of the civil leaders. Lyon wrote that through history stratocracies have been relatively rare, and that in the latter half of the twentieth century there has been a noticeable increase in the number of stratocratic states due to the \"rapid collapse of the West European thalassocracies\"."]}, {"page": "S.E.Finer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Finer"]}, {"page": "Gladstone Professor of Government", "response": ["* Samuel Finer, 1974-1982"]}, {"page": "Hybrid regime", "response": ["The researchers conducted a comparative analysis of political regimes around the world (Samuel Finer 1970), in developing countries (Almond and Coleman, 1960), among Latin America (Collier 1979) and West Africa regimes (Zolberg, 1966).
