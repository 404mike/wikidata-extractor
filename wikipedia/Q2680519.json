In 2004, Helliwell formed the band Cr\u00e8me Anglaise with Mark Hart, who had joined Supertramp in 1985. This group recorded their eponymous debut album in 2005.\nIn 1987 Helliwell played on Pink Floyd's album A Momentary Lapse of Reason; his name was misspelled as \"Halliwell\".

Helliwell also played on French singer Jean-Jacques Goldman's 1985 album Positif, and clarinet on Sara Hickman's 1990 album Shortstop.\nDuring a professional lull in the 1990s, Helliwell began studying for a music degree at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, but he discontinued his studies to join Supertramp on tour when Some Things Never Change was released. In 2004 he contributed saxophone work on the Simon Apple album River to the Sea.Helliwell contributed clarinet to The Pineapple Thief's song \"Fend For Yourself\" from their Your Wilderness album which was released in 2016.Helliwell fronts the Super Big Tramp Band, which has a jazz big band line-up of trumpets, trombones, saxophones and rhythm section.
