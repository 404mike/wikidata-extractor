Chairman Greg Dyke revealed that, despite an FA Cup run and the \u00a3500,000 sale of forward DJ Campbell during 2005\u201306 season, Allen's departure was due to the reduction of the cash-strapped club's wage budget for 2006\u201307. Chief scout John Griffin handled first team affairs until the appointment of Leroy Rosenior as manager on 14 June. Despite the off-season sales of star players Jay Tabb, Michael Turner and Sam Sodje generating upwards of \u00a31,000,000, Rosenior was forced to bring in players on free transfers. A new spine for the team was assembled from central defenders Adam Griffiths and Matthew Heywood, midfielder Thomas Pinault and forwards Jo Kuffour and Chris Moore. Goalkeeper Stuart Nelson, full backs Andy Frampton and Kevin O'Connor, midfielders \u00d3lafur Ingi Sk\u00falason, Paul Brooker, Alex Rhodes and forwards Lloyd Owusu and Calum Willock remained from the previous season's squad, though Owusu would miss much of the campaign with a groin injury.", "Brentford enjoyed a good start to the season, going undefeated in eight matches and rising as high as fourth in the table. A 2\u20130 league defeat to Swansea City on 12 September began a sharp downturn in fortunes, with injuries to eight senior players forcing Rosenior to turn to inexperienced youngsters John Mousinho, Clark Masters, Darius Charles, Ryan Peters, Karleigh Osborne and Karle Carder-Andrews. After injury to Calum Willock and a loss of form from Chris Moore, incoming forwards Clyde Wijnhard and Fola Onibuje failed to readdress the team's goalscoring problems. After a winless run of 16 games which dropped Brentford into the League One relegation zone, Leroy Rosenior was sacked as manager after a 4\u20130 home defeat to Crewe Alexandra on 18 November.", "|Chris Moore", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Chris Moore", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Chris Moore", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Chris Moore", "| Chris Moore", "| Chris Moore"]}]}}
