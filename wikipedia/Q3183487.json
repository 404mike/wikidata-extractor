His first novel, Boy A, won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize 2004, the Waverton Good Read Award and the inaugural World Book Day Prize in 2008.\nJonathan completed an MA in creative writing at Manchester University, where he also studied English as an undergraduate. He spent many winters in the Alps working in the Ski Tourism Industry and now lives in Chamonix, France.Boy A is the story of a child criminal released into society as an adult. It has obvious and presumably deliberate parallels to the fates of the murderers of James Bulger, although the crime itself differs significantly.\nHighly acclaimed critically, Boy A was described by Sarah Waters, Chair of the Judges for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, as \"a compelling narrative, a beautifully structured piece of writing, and a thought-provoking novel of ideas. It's a wonderful debut.\"Trigell's follow up Cham, familiar name of Chamonix, also acquired by Serpent's Tail publishing house, was published in October 2007 and shortlisted for the Boardman Tasker Prize.\nJonathan's third work Genus - about a dystopian divided Britain - was published in July 2011. It contains chapters describing rioting in London eerily similar to the disturbances that broke out only weeks after publication. Genus was optioned for film by Matador Pictures, with Mike Carey (writer) attached to write the script.\nTrigell's fourth novel was published in 2015 and titled The Tongues of Men or Angels. In an interview the author described it as \"A Biblical Era Road Movie\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "response": ["|2004 || Jonathan Trigell || Boy A || ||Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Purple HibiscusRory Stewart, The Places in BetweenNeil Bennun, The Broken String: The Last Words of an Extinct PeopleColin McAdam, Some Great Thing Anthony Cartwright, The Afterglow"]}, {"page": "2004 in literature", "response": ["*Jonathan Trigell \u2013 Boy A"]}, {"page": "Trigell", "response": ["#redirect Jonathan Trigell"]}, {"page": "Boy A", "response": ["Boy A is the debut novel by Jonathan Trigell, which was first published in 2004.", "The book and film share several similarities with the notorious murder of James Bulger at the hands of two ten-year-old boys in 1993.
