He was also in the Celtic youth team but never played a first-team game for them.\nWhen playing for Dumfries club, Queen of the South, McKeown was part of the side that made it to the 1997 Scottish Challenge Cup final playing alongside Jamie McAllister, Andy Aitken, Jim Thomson, and man of the match Tommy Bryce.In 2001, he was the subject of a book published by Mainstream Publishing entitled \"Don't Give Up the Day Job: A Year in the Life a Part-time Footballer\" written by Bill Leckie, which gave an insight into the difficulties of juggling work commitments and family life, whilst playing as a part-time professional footballer for Queen of the South F.C. in the Scottish League. This was his second stint with the Palmerston Park club.\nHis playing career effectively came to an end after sustaining a broken leg in a pre-season game between Barrow AFC and Stenhousemuir in 2002. He managed Stenhousemuir from 2004-2006 (during the 2004-2005 season, he was co-manager alongside Tony Smith). McKeown, who nowadays owns a stationery supply company in the Glasgow area, works part-time as a pundit for BBC Scotland and also has a column in the Scottish edition of The Sun newspaper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Smith (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["Two months after his arrival at Shielfield Park, Smith was appointed manager, a post he held until 2004 where he got the club promoted to the Scottish Second Division. He later performed the role of assistant manager to Des McKeown at Stenhousemuir, until the pair's dismissal in November 2006. He later worked for Raith Rovers as assistant manager to Grant Murray; he had been assistant to John McGlynn when the club were promoted to the First Division, reached a Scottish Cup semi-final and just missed out on promotion to the SPL. He was also caretaker manager at Raith following the departure of McGlynn to Hearts, following which he was appointed to continue the assistant manager role by Murray."]}, {"page": "John Paul McBride", "response": ["McBride signed with Stenhousemuir after being released by Partick Thistle. He made his debut with Stenhousemuir under manager Des McKeown in the Scottish League Challenge Cup against Queen's Park, and remained with the club for three years, scoring 19 goals. McKeown formed the opinion that McBride could have performed at the highest levels of football had he shown the required application and attitude to match his talent, but acknowledged that he had to cope with various issues in his personal life."]}, {"page": "Campbell Money", "response": ["Money then joined Stenhousemuir as youth development director, where he gained a reputation of breeding young talent at the club. He replaced Des McKeown as manager in early November 2006.
