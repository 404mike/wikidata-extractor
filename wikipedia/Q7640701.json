The opposition of the Council to the clause and to British policy in Iraq attracted both praise and criticism.

Wirathu, the leader of 969 Movement, has said that Muslim men pretend to be Buddhists and then the Buddhist women are lured into Islam in Myanmar. He has urged to \"protect our Buddhist women from the Muslim love-jihad\" by introducing further legislation. Reports of similar activities also began emerging from the United Kingdom's Sikh diaspora. According to an opinion piece by the Sikh Liberal Politics blogger Sunny Hundal, \"In the 90s, an anonymous leaflet (suspected to be by Hizb ut-Tahrir followers) urged Muslim men to seduce Sikh girls to convert them to Islam.\" In 2014, The Sikh Council alleged that it had received reports that girls from British Sikh families were becoming victims of Love Jihad. Furthermore, these reports alleged that these girls were being exploited by their husbands, some of whom afterwards abandoned them in Pakistan. According to the Takht jathedar, he alleged that \"The Sikh council has rescued some of the victims (girls) and brought them back to their parents.\"", "In 2018, a report by the fundamentalist Sikh activist organisation, Sikh Youth UK, entitled \"The Religiously Aggravated Sexual Exploitation of Young Sikh Women Across the UK\" (RASE report) made similar allegations of Muslim men targeting Sikh girls for the purposes of conversion. The report was severely criticised in 2019 by academic researchers and by an official UK government report lead by two Sikh academics for false and misleading information.Jagbir Jhutti-Johal; Sunny Hundal (August 2019).
