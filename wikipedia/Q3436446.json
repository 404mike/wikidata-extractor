He continued to score regularly, netting 8\u00a0goals in 15\u00a0appearances, although he was forced to stop playing for a period in the winter of 1963 when adverse weather caused the postponement of several matches.Thomas (2005), p. 73 After his Northern Ireland debut in April that year, he made several more appearances for the reserves, and his goal against Blackpool was described by journalist Keith McNee as \"the finest goal [he had] seen\".Thomas (2005), p. 82 On 11 May 1963, Irvine was asked by manager Potts to travel with the first team for their final away fixture of the season at Arsenal. He was a boot boy, and was originally only intended to assist Ray Bennion in transporting the team kit to and from the game. It was reported in the Burnley Express the day before the match that he would be making his professional debut against Arsenal, although Irvine himself only found out just before the match.Thomas (2005), p. 86 He started at centre forward in place of Lochhead, who was unable to play because of a leg injury. Irvine had a successful introduction to senior football and scored a headed goal after 20\u00a0minutes of play, the first goal in a 3\u20132 win for Burnley.Simpson (2007), p. 306 He was again selected three days later for the last game of the campaign at home to Birmingham City and scored a hat-trick as Burnley ended the season with a 3\u20131 victory."]}, {"page": "Bennion", "response": ["* Ray Bennion (1898\u20131968), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Billy Dougall", "response": ["In 1938, Dougall was appointed official schools coach by the Lancashire County Football Association. He continued to coach at Burnley and was described by club chairman Bob Lord as a \"jewel\", stating that Dougall and reserve team manager Ray Bennion were \"the finest servants a football club could have\". At the age of 61, Dougall was offered to take over the manager's post from Alan Brown in July 1957. His first game in charge of Burnley was the 0\u20130 draw away at Portsmouth on 24 August 1957. He got his first win three days later as his side defeated local rivals Preston North End 2\u20130 at Turf Moor. Soon after, he suffered ill health and control of the first team was passed to Ray Bennion while Dougall underwent hospital treatment. He was forced to relinquish his position as manager in January 1958 on medical advice, and was immediately appointed as Burnley's physiotherapist. He held the post for seven years before announcing his retirement at the end of the 1964\u201365 season."]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["| Ray Bennion", "|align=\"left\"|Ray Bennion"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Ray Bennion"]}]}}
