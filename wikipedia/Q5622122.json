In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, \"The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History\", which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895. Becoming Petrie's de facto though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith's absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murray's students\u00a0\u2013 to whom she referred as \"the Gang\"\u00a0\u2013 were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including Reginald Engelbach, Georgina Aitken, Guy Brunton, and Myrtle Broome.

He suggests that, in his haste and without realising, Ayrton had cut through remains of wooden or other organic objects, which would have been reduced to a stain in the sediment, similar to the situation encountered by Guy Brunton in the tomb of Sithathoriunet at El Lahun. Robbers had entered the tomb in antiquity and looted most of the burial; their entrance was left open for some time, allowing mud and debris to wash in and accumulate before finally flood action sealed the tomb again. Reeves suggests that the tomb was robbed when already partially filled with mud, resulting only pieces visible above the infill being taken. The silver hands, in Aldred's opinion, held the decayed hands of a mummy, as Ayrton retrieved eight of the gold rings from the mud inside. He suggests that the tomb was not a cache of objects but originally contained the burial of a young princess, likely not more than four years old."]}, {"page": "Winifred Brunton", "response": ["Brunton was born in 1880 in the Orange Free State South Africa.

Her interest in archaeology began on a trip to Egypt with her mother in 1911, followed by a series of lectures on Ancient Greece given by Sarah Paterson at the British Museum. An inheritance received in 1912 helped ensure her financial independence and support her later excavations. Caton Thompson's first experience in the field came in 1915 working as a bottle washer in an excavation in France. During World War I, she worked for the British Ministry of Shipping as part of which she attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.  In 1921 Caton Thompson embarked on studies at University College London where she was taught by Margaret Murray, Flinders Petrie and Dorothea Bate, excavating in Upper Egypt during the winter of that year .Caton Thompson, G.C. 1983.

While in his later years he had not the opportunity to take part in excavating expeditions sent out by the Museum, he was of great assistance in organising the expeditions of Dr. Campbell Thompson at Nineveh and Mr. Guy Brunton in Upper Egypt. He was, despite an initial and boyish brusqueness of manner, a charming colleague and tactful in the division of the spoils of excavation when these had been acquired jointly with other bodies. On the art of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia he was perhaps the pre-eminent authority, and it was one of his first tasks as Keeper to rearrange many of the galleries so as to stress the artistic and historical side of archaeology and less the predominantly religious emphasis which previously existed. Of the collections in the British Museum Hall published a work on the Coptic and Greek texts of the Christian period, one volume of a catalogue of scarabs, and six volumes on the hieroglyphic texts."]}, {"page": "Xia Nai", "response": ["\u00a0 This project consists of 1760 index cards, with each including the registration number, provenance, date, use, reference, remarks, drawing, and photograph number of the corresponding string of beads.Xia, Ancient Egyptians Bead, pp. vii-x. The significance of Xia\u2019s index cards was its clarity, straightforwardness, and credibility granted by the inclusion of both an index and a bibliography. Therefore, it was believed that these cards were intentionally made for future research purposes, as his notes allowed both himself and modern scholars to easily comprehend his findings. Xia\u2019s research discussed the material, typology (including the technical peculiarities), use, arrangement and pictorial representation of the beads in relation to the nine divisions of the Ancient Egyptian dynasties. Hence, his research illuminated the characteristics of each of the periods, the general development from dynasty to dynasty and ancient Egypt\u2019s contact with foreign countries.Xia, Ancient Egyptians Bead, pp. xiii, 71-2. His assessment of the beads also corrected many mistakes regarding the dating and material by Petrie. For instance, some beads were classified as being made out of the same material since they looked similar or some strings would be dated based on the dating of the tomb in which it was recovered from instead of the actual dating of the beads themselves.Xia, Ancient Egyptians Bead, pp. 71-2. Xia also proposed a new method to categorize the beads thus coming up with the first-ever comprehensive bead corpus to have included ancient Egyptian beads from all periods dated before the Arab conquest of Egypt.Xia, Ancient Egyptians Bead, pp. xiii, 57.  He came up with a classification method that is based on the \u2018group of material\u2019 which subdivided into two groups of \u2018decorated\u2019 and \u2018undecorated\u2019.Xia, Ancient Egyptians Bead, pp. 56-7. He justified that his classification method was both scientific and systematic after evaluating the pros and cons of other pre-existing beads classification methods by Horace C.
