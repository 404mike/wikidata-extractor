It has been described by the BBC as \"perhaps the most famous of all streaks.\" Roe, who later attributed the inspiration to alcohol, ran onto the field during half time, exposing her 40-inch (100 cm) bosom. Roe and Sarah Bennett, the friend who joined her streak, were corralled by officials.\nWhile Roe was not the first or the last streaker at an athletic event, in 2007 The Independent of London declared that her \"memorable\" streak made her a suitable icon to represent all such streakers in their article on sports interruptions. The event prompted web site Manchester Confidential to dub her \"the most famous British streaker\".Roe's continuing notoriety saw her appear on the nostalgic British TV programmes After They Were Famous (1999) and '80s Mania (2001).She worked at that time in a bookstore in Petersfield, Hampshire, but later moved with her husband and children to Portugal, where, as of 2001, she and her family operated a sweet potato farm.In March 2016 she appeared as a contestant on series 3 of The Island with Bear Grylls.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Petersfield", "response": ["In the sporting world, John Small, shopkeeper, cobbler, and Hambledon cricketer is buried in the churchyard of St Peter's.

This earned England their first BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. The victory was something of a false dawn and the remainder of the decade was not a great period for the England team. The subsequent Championship of 1981 was less successful for England, winning two of their four games, and was followed up with a draw and win against Argentina. England kicked off 1982 with a victory over the Wallabies in a tight game, winning 15 to 11 in England; the game was made famous by Erica Roe's famous streak across the pitch. Their Five Nations campaign was similarly successful, drawing with Scotland, losing to Ireland, and victories over France and Wales. At the match banquet after the win against France in Paris, there was a complimentary bottle of cologne next to each player's place at the table. Second row Maurice Colclough emptied the flask and refilled it with wine, which he then drank. Team-mate Colin Smart saw only Colclough seemingly sink a bottle of cologne and decided to follow suit. Within an hour he was on his way to hospital to have his stomach pumped, although as scrum-half Steve Smith pointed out: 'He may have been unwell, but Colin had the nicest breath I've smelt.'"]}, {"page": "Erika roe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Erica Roe"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["The match was also notable for the half-time appearance of the streaker, Erica Roe."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Unassessed Hampshire articles", "response": ["==Erica Roe==", "Erica Roe seems to have been claimed by the Hampshire portal.
