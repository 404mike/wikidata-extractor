Many of his designs are considered by Philip Allingham (Faculty of Education, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario) to be workmanlike rather than anything more inspired, although he considers Thomas Dalziel's illustrations for Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and The Arabian Nights to be above average.", "link_mentions": {}}}
