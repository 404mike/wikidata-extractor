Angered by this intransigence and abusive police activity, some WSPU members increased the severity of their actions. Soon after the rally, twelve women gathered in Parliament Square and tried to deliver speeches for women's suffrage. Police officers seized several of the speakers and pushed them into a crowd of opponents who had gathered nearby. Frustrated, two WSPU members \u2013 Edith New and Mary Leigh \u2013 went to 10 Downing Street and hurled rocks at the windows of the Prime Minister's home. They insisted their act was independent of the WSPU command, but Pankhurst expressed her approval of the action. When a magistrate sentenced New and Leigh to two months' imprisonment, Pankhurst reminded the court of how various male political agitators had broken windows to win legal and civil rights throughout Britain's history.Purvis 2002, pp. 108\u2013109; Bartley, pp. 96\u201397."]}, {"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["* Edith New"]}, {"page": "Lucy Burns", "response": ["Burns was with Jennie Baines, Mary Leigh, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper trying to stop a Limehouse meeting on the Budget by Lloyd George.

While Burns is not a widely known speaker from the woman's rights movement, she did make a variety of speeches in marketplaces and on street corners while in Europe. Her activism resulted in numerous court appearances and reports of \"disorderly conduct\" in the newspapers.

Burns and Paul were involved in a stunt at the London Lord Mayor's Ball, mingling with guests then approaching Winston Churchill with a hidden banner shouting \"How can you dine here while women are starving in prison?\" Again this resulted in prison, self-starving and force feeding."]}, {"page": "1951 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 January \u2013 Edith New, suffragette (born 1877)"]}, {"page": "Anna Munro", "response": ["Anna was born in Glasgow, on 4 October 1881, to Margaret Ann MacVean, and Evan Macdonald Munro, a school master; following her mother's death in 1892 she moved to Dunfermline where she was cared for by an uncle and aunt.

She accompanied Amy Sanderson, WLF executive committee member and fellow prisoner, on a speaking tour around the country, raising awareness and funds for the militant movement, and with hunger strikers Alice Paul and Edith New at Arbroath. in 1911, she was pictured in The Vote with the Scottish delegates to WFL Conference with Agnes Husband and six others.
