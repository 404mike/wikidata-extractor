His father was an English teacher; his mother was a librarian. He attended Whitgift School in Croydon and read law at Merton College, Oxford. Shivas wrote for the student magazine Oxford Opinions. After abandoning a legal career, he co-founded the magazine Movie (1961\u201364) which used the French publication  Cahiers du Cinema as its model,. He was assistant editor (1962\u201364), and also contributed interviews and articles to The New York Times.He began his television career at Granada Television in 1964 as an assistant to the head of the story department and later worked on the company's Cinema series as a producer and presenter. In 1969 he joined the BBC's drama department, and became one of the corporation's most successful and prolific producers. The costume drama The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970),  was nominated for three Emmy Awards in 1972. Dennis Potter's Casanova (1971) was another success.Other productions he oversaw included the anthology series Black and Blue (1973), which included the play Secrets by Michael Palin and Terry Jones.  Critics disliked Shivas's production of The Borgias (1981) for the BBC; it suffered in comparison with the contemporary Brideshead Revisited on ITV.Shivas was head of drama at the BBC from 1988 to 1993; he then moved to the BBC Films, and was executive producer of twenty films. In later years, he returned to producing as a freelancer. Some of his most noted later productions included the second series of Alan Bennett's Talking Heads monologues in 1998 and the 2003 espionage drama Cambridge Spies.Shivas died from lung cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maggie Smith", "response": ["She won her second Best Actress BAFTA Film Awards for her role as Joyce Chilvers in the 1984 black comedy A Private Function with Michael Palin.

However, the pigs were \"unpredictable and often quite dangerous\". During the filming of one of the kitchen scenes, Smith was hemmed in by one of the pigs, and needed to vault over the back of it in order to escape. She also starred in the 1984 Hungarian-American film Lily in Love with Christopher Plummer. According to Smith's biographer, she referred to the film as \"the ghoulash\" and admitted to not understanding the Hungarian director's direction.

In 1970, he joined Alan Marshall to establish a company to make advertisements.

World Film Directors, Vol. II, H.W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 740\u2013743 Among their award-winning adverts were the UK Cinzano vermouth advertisement (starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter), and a Heineken advert which used one hundred actors. Parker credited his years writing and directing adverts for his later success as a film director: After writing the screenplay for the Waris Hussein film Melody in 1971, Parker shot his first fictional film titled No Hard Feelings in 1973, for which he wrote the script. The film is a bleak love story set against the Blitz in London during the Second World War, when the Luftwaffe bombed the city for 57 consecutive nights.Parker, Alan. Making of \"No Hard Feelings\" Parker was born during one of those bombing raids, and said \"the baby in that [film] could well have been me\". With no feature film directing experience, he could not find financial backing, and decided to risk using his own money and funds from mortgaging his house to cover the cost. The film impressed the BBC, which bought the film and showed it on television a few years later, in 1976. The BBC producer Mark Shivas had, in the interim, also contracted Parker to direct The Evacuees (1975), a Second World War story written by Jack Rosenthal which was shown as a Play for Today.
