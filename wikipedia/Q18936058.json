One in south-west England in 1796 led to an acquaintance with Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet, a judge and improver at Princetown on Dartmoor. Buller corresponded with Young on agricultural matters. The relationship later became awkward, however, when Young's son, the Rev. Arthur Young, was suspected of jury tampering in the trial of Arthur O'Connor, on the basis of a letter to Gamaliel Lloyd of Bury St Edmunds, a radical. Buller and the attorney-general took a belligerent attitude to the allegations, when the letter was read out in court."]}, {"page": "Leonard Horner", "response": ["Horner married Anna Susanna Lloyd, daughter of Gamaliel Lloyd.https://www.geni.com/people/Leonard-Horner/6000000001779983778"]}, {"page": "Christopher Wyvill", "response": ["A committee under Wyvill was appointed to continue the pressure by correspondence, and the example of Yorkshire was followed by other counties, 25 in all.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) in 1737, being sponsored as \"a gentleman well-skilled in mathematical knowledge and natural philosophy\". He rented Alkrington Hall from the Lever family before buying Hulme Hall as his residence. Lloyd sold Hulme Hall in 1764 to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, who had to pay a large amount of money to acquire it so that he could continue construction of his eponymous canal."]}]}}
