He was part of the Fulham team that won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002. He also played in the Football League for Doncaster Rovers, Plymouth Argyle, Leicester City and Oxford United.\nSince retiring, Brevett was manager of non-league side Arlesey Town between 2013 and 2014.

Signed by manager Lou Macari, Allen made his debut on 26 August 1989 in a 3\u20132 home win against Plymouth Argyle. He scored the second goal, the other West Ham goals coming from David Kelly and Kevin Keen. Under manager Billy Bonds Allen was part of the team which won promotion to the First Division in 1991 and to the Premier League in 1993. Allen was frequently booked during his West Ham career and had a reputation for poor discipline. He was  sent off in a match on 17 January 1990 for a two-footed lunge on Derby County's Mark Patterson. During a game on 30 November 1991 against Sheffield Wednesday, managed by Allen's manager at Queens Park Rangers, Trevor Francis, Allen was booked after only 20 seconds of being on the pitch for a jump tackle on Carlton Palmer which saw Palmer carried off with a suspected broken leg. Although not sent-off, West Ham manager Bonds fined Allen a week's wages. During his time at Queens Park Rangers Allen had been refused permission, by manager Francis, to attend the birth of his first child as Allen would miss an important match. Allen attended the birth and was disciplined by the club. Under Bonds and Harry Redknapp Allen formed a successful partnership with Peter Butler with Allen contributing 34 goals from midfield in 234 appearances. However, by 1995 team discipline was poor at West Ham and with Allen playing alongside Julian Dicks, John Moncur and Don Hutchison bookings were commonplace. Allen was again dismissed in a match against Queens Park Rangers on 3 May 1995 after fouling Rufus Brevett. He would play only five more games before being allowed to leave."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in English football", "response": ["*End of season \u2013 Rufus Brevett (Oxford United)Brevett announces his retirement BBC Sport Retrieved 17 August 2007"]}, {"page": "Clinton Morrison", "response": ["However, his start to his Birmingham City's career suffered a setback when he sustained a groin injury during the club's pre\u2013season that saw him missed two matches. Morrison made his debut for Birmingham City, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Everton on 28 August 2002. It wasn't until on 11 September 2002 when he scored his first goals, in a 2\u20132 draw against Liverpool. This was followed up by scoring his third goal for the club against Aston Villa, their first win in 16 years following their return to the top flight, during a 3\u20130 victory at St. Andrews. His fourth goal for Birmingham City came on 23 November 2002, in a 1\u20130 win against Sunderland. During a 1\u20130 win against Fulham on 15 December 2002, in which Morrison set up the only goal of the game, he was involved in an argument with Rufus Brevett that his mother got involved following the match, though both clubs said the incident never happened. After missing one match due to injury, he scored on two weeks after his return from injury, in a 4\u20132 loss against Bolton Wanderers on 1 February 2003. Three weeks later, Morrison scored for the second time this season against Liverpool on 23 February 2003, in a 2\u20131 win.

West Ham were bottom at Christmas and at that time no team had ever avoided relegation from that position. Despite the January signings of Rufus Brevett,  Lee Bowyer on a short-term deal, and Les Ferdinand, Roeder was unable to halt the team's slump. Roeder had a dispute with striker Paolo Di Canio after he substituted Di Canio in a match against West Bromwich Albion. In April 2003, Roeder suffered a brain tumour and was replaced by Trevor Brooking for the final three games of the season.

Despite taking the job with the club deep in relegation trouble, a tremendous run of form saw Baker steer Harrow Borough to safety as the club ended the 2014/15 season in 16th place, as well as progressing to two cup finals in both Middlesex competitions\u00a0\u2013 the Middlesex Senior Cup and Middlesex Charity Cup.

It was found that Carlisle had torn his posterior cruciate ligament, an injury which kept him sidelined for a year and caused doctors to believe that his career might be over. While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league.
