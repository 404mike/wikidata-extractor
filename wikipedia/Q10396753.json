Two years later he signed with Rotherham United, and stayed with the Millers until 2000. He then played for Macclesfield Town and Mansfield Town, before moving into non-league football with Burton Albion and Corby Town. He travelled to Wembley for the 1991 FA Cup and 1996 Anglo-Italian Cup finals, and was also an unused substitute at the 1989 and 1992 Football League Cup Final and the 1992 Full Members' Cup Final.

A further \u00a3200,000 was splashed out on Nottingham Forest forward Lee Glover. Another \u00a34,500 was spent on Dutch goalkeeper Arjan van Heusden from VV Noordwijk.

In September only Lee Glover, Tony Naylor and Martin Foyle could find the net, but the Vale won six points from their five games. To help with his recovery from a serious injury, Ray Walker spent some time on loan at Cambridge United, and won back his first team place in the Vale starting eleven upon his return. Meanwhile, Tony Kelly arrived at the club from Bolton Wanderers, but after a brief spell moved on to Millwall. Vale's poor attack was highlighted in October, though the defence ensured three draws from five games. In November, Darren Hughes was allowed to leave the club for Northampton Town. Rudge decided to make another big signing, and bought winger Steve Guppy from Newcastle United for \u00a3225,000. On 5 November, Vale lost all their inhibitions in front of goal, beating Southend United 5\u20130 with five different scorers. However their draw with Swindon Town would prove to be the only point gained in December, as Vale were stuck in a relegation dogfight. John Jeffers spent January on loan at Shrewsbury Town. During this spell defender Kevin Scott arrived on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The team gelled, forming a five-game unbeaten run based on just two goals conceded to shoot up the table. In March, midfielder Ian Bogie was signed from Leyton Orient for a \u00a350,000 fee. Potteries derby day finally came on 14 March, and 19,510 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke City, Naylor scoring the Vale's goal. Five defeats in seven games followed, raising concerns of the drop. However the Vale were unbeaten in their final five games to ensure safety. This included a 3\u20133 draw at Elm Park that saw the \"Valiants\" come from three goals down to claim a point. It also included a 1\u20130 win over Stoke at the Victoria Ground on 22 April, Foyle scoring the goal.", "In the League Cup, Vale advanced past Second Division Bristol Rovers 4\u20132 on aggregate, having won 3\u20131 at the Memorial Stadium. In the Second Round they faced Premier League Manchester United. Alex Ferguson's \"Red Devils\" beat John Rudge's \"Valiants\" 2\u20131 at Vale Park in front of 18,605 supporters; Lee Glover scoring for Vale and Paul Scholes scoring a brace on his United debut. At the time Vale fans were disappointed to witness the then-unknown United reserves, though Scholes would go on to become a household name, as would teenage teammates Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, and David Beckham; the United first eleven would go on to win a combined total of more than 500 international caps over the course of their careers. For the second leg there were 31,615 fans at Old Trafford to witness a 2\u20130 United victory, David May and Brian McClair getting the goals.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Lee Glover", "|4||FW||||Lee Glover||4||0||3||7", "| July 1994 || FW ||  || Lee Glover || Nottingham Forest || \u00a3200,000 || "]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the season Kevin Kent retired, and took up a coaching role at the club.
