Theatrical. Wood's Museum.\" The New York Times, 1 October 1868 (review of Ixion). The six-month tour was extended to almost six years, and during two subsequent tours the British Blondes drew large crowds at leading theatres across the US. The troupe launched the careers of several actors, including Markham, Alice Burville, Lisa Weber and Rose Coghlan, and of comedian Willie Edouin. It also drew fierce criticism from those who felt it transgressed the boundaries of propriety. Burlesques, colloquially referred to as leg-shows, started off tame, clever and sophisticated, drawing in all types of people, especially women. Unfortunately, \u201cthe female audiences for burlesque did not last for long. In the summer of 1869 a wave of \u2018anti-burlesque hysteria\u2019 in the New York press frightened away the middle-class audiences that had initially been drawn to Ixion and sent the Thompson troupe prematurely packing for a national tour\u201d.Dudden, Faye E. \"The Rise of the Leg Show\", Women in the American Theatre: Actresses and Audeiences, New Haven, Yale UP (1994) After this untimely closure, the hatred toward American burlesque continued to grow. Thompson's shows were described as a \u201cdisgraceful spectacle of padded legs jiggling and wriggling in the insensate follies and indecencies of the hour\u201d.Moses, Marlie. \"Lydia Thompson and The \u2018British Blondes\u2019.\", Women in the American theatre, New York, Crown (1981) Times called their shows \u201can idiotic parody of masculinity\u201d.

B. Farnie's burlesques of Bluebeard (which she had already made a hit in America) and Robinson Crusoe, and Robert Reece's Carmen, or, Sold for a Song, as well as Piff-Paff (Le Grand Duc de Matapa), Oxygen, The Lady of Lyons, Pluto! and other burlesques. In her production of Bluebeard, she received a review in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News saying, \u201cthe acting of Miss Lydia Thompson not even the most fastidious can find fault. Her chic amuses, her abandon bewitches, her personal charms delight and indeed, in all she does, whether speaking, singing or dancing she exercises over her audiences an influence which is perfectly irresistible, taking by storm the hearts of all who see and hear her.\u201d  The author christens Thompson the savior of the once-dying art form of burlesque, saying, \u201cThe name of Miss Lydia Thompson has acted as a spell and has charmed the apparently dead back to life.\u201d ", "thumb|Shipwrecked steamer named Lydia Thompson in 1905 ad for the Alaska Company, Inc. of Seattle", "*G\u00e4nzl, Kurt.
