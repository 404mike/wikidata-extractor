The election was notable for both the attacks of the Suffragette movement on Churchill, over his refusal to support legislation that would give women the vote, and Jewish hostility to Joynson-Hicks over his support for the controversial Aliens Act which aimed to restrict Jewish immigration.Paul Addison, Churchill on the Home Front 1900\u20131955 (2nd ed., London 1993) p. 64 Joynson-Hicks called Labour leader Keir Hardie \"a leprous traitor\" who wanted to sweep away the Ten Commandments. This prompted H G Wells to send an open letter to Labour sympathisers in Manchester,although an SDF candidate obtained a modest vote at the by-election, there was no official Labour Party candidate at this or any previous election for the seat; Labour supporters were therefore encouraged to vote Liberal in accordance with the Gladstone-MacDonald pact saying that Joynson-Hicks \"represents absolutely the worst element in British political life \u2026 an entirely undistinguished man \u2026 and an obscure and ineffectual nobody\".", "Joynson-Hicks gained personal notoriety in the immediate aftermath of this election for an address to his Jewish hosts at a dinner given by the Maccabean Society, during which he said \"he had beaten them all thoroughly and soundly and was no longer their servant.\" Subsequent allegations that he was personally anti-Semitic formed an important strand of the authoritarian streak that many, including recent scholars David Cesarani and Geoffrey Alderman, detected in his speeches and behaviour.
