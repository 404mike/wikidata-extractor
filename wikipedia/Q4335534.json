He has won several tournaments on the Gloucester and Somerset PGA Circuit and headed the Order of Merit in both 2006\u20137 and 2008\u20139.On turning 50 in 2008 Ryall joined the European Senior Tour, gaining a conditional card at his first attempt at qualifying school. He failed to win sufficient money in his rookie season to retain his playing status, which resulted in limited opportunities in 2010. He made the most of those chances, finishing tied for 5th at the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open in early July which gained him entry to the Van Lanschot Senior Open the following week, where he claimed his first title with a one stroke victory over Andrew Oldcorn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Woosnam", "response": ["| Philip Golding,  David J.
