He graduated from the University of Strathclyde and became a lecturer in Economics there and a Labour councillor. From 1984 he was Managing Director of Michael Kelly Associates, a PR company. He held the position of Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1980 to 1984, and was Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1984 to 1987. As Lord Provost, he was instrumental in the city's adoption of the Glasgow's miles better campaign and slogan, which is credited with an important role in Glasgow's cultural renaissance during the 1980s. A member of one of the families that had controlled Celtic F.C. since its foundation, he sat on the club's board of directors until 1994, when the club reached the verge of bankruptcy and the much-criticised old regime was ousted by Fergus McCann's takeover.\nDr Kelly is now a writer and PR consultant.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["By the end of the 1980s the Celtic board consisted of chairman McGinn and directors Kevin Kelly, Chris White, Tom Grant and Jimmy Farrell. Neither McGinn nor Farrell were members of the traditional family dynasties at Celtic. Farrell was a partner in the Shaughnessy law firm that had long-standing connections with Celtic, and was invited to become a director in 1964. McGinn had set up The Celtic View in the 1960s and later became the club's commercial manager. He was given a seat on the board and became Chairman in 1986. In May 1990 the former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Michael Kelly, and property developer Brian Dempsey were invited to join the Celtic board. Dempsey did not last long however, as a dispute about a proposed relocation to Robroyston resulted in him being voted off the board five months later."]}, {"page": "Celtic Park", "response": ["Celtic was heavily in debt and had been significantly outgrown by Rangers commercially in the early 1990s. The Celtic board initially prevaricated in response to the Taylor Report, partly due to divisions in the board. Celtic director Brian Dempsey proposed a development on land he controlled at Robroyston, but he was opposed by fellow directors, Michael Kelly and Chris White, who had Dempsey removed from the board. Despite these divisions, a proposal to build a new 52,000 seat stadium on industrial waste ground at Cambuslang was unveiled in April 1992. The \u00a3100 million scheme was meant to include wider commercial developments that would fund the completed stadium, which would have only provided 32,000 seats in a first phase of construction. There was scepticism about the plan, however, as it was unclear how Celtic or their partner in the project, Superstadia, would raise the necessary finance. The proposed site would have had to be decontaminated, and contradictory statements about the ownership structure of the development were issued. Outline planning permission was granted in May 1993."]}, {"page": "Michael Kelly", "response": ["* Michael Kelly (Australian politician), New South Wales colonial politician", "* Michael Kelly (Illinois politician) (born 1975), politician and athletic director from Illinois", "* Michael Kelly (Lord Provost) (born 1940), former Lord Provost of the City of Glasgow, Scotland and businessman", "* Michael Kelly (footballer, born 1877), English footballer", "* Michael Kelly (footballer, born 1997), Scottish footballer for Bristol Rovers", "* Michael Kelly (Gaelic footballer), Irish sportsperson who represented Donegal", "* Michael Kelly (sport shooter) (1872\u20131923), American Olympic sport shooter", "* Michael Kelly, former president of Blockbuster LLC", "* Michael Kelly (tenor) (1762\u20131826), Irish actor, singer and composer", "* Michael Schermick (born 1958), known professionally as Michael Kelly Smith, American guitar player", "* Michael Kelly Guitars, American guitar, bass, and mandolin manufacturer", "* Michael Kelly (editor) (1957\u20132003), American writer and editor", "* Michael Kelly (journalist), Irish journalist", "* Michael Kelly (bishop) (1850\u20131940), fourth Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney", "* Michael Kelly (physicist) (born 1949), New Zealand-British physicist", "* Michael Kelly (actor) (born 1969), American actor"]}, {"page": "List of provosts of Glasgow", "response": ["*1980\u20131984 \u2013 Michael Kelly (Labour)"]}, {"page": "Reginald Bosanquet", "response": ["Bosanquet was elected rector of the University of Glasgow in 1980, serving until 1984.
