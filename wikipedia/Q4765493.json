The family home in Sarghoda was built among the Punjab Canal Colonies north west of  Lahore. For his efforts in recruiting Punjabi men for the First World War and for attending to the sick during the influenza epidemic of 1918, the British had rewarded Papa-ji with sanads, deeds confirming his allegiance to them. He later received an OBE for his service during the 1919 campaign in Afghanistan. In the following years leading to 1947, his children, nephews and nieces, did not share all his views, and some would be involved in freedom campaigns. Here she places the significance of the Sikhs in the British Indian Army, Unionist rule and the rise of nationalist politics with the Indian National Congress and All-India Muslim League. She links her family's political connection to Papa-ji's cousin, Ujjal Singh , clarifies Sir Sobha Singh's association with Bhagat Singh and reads Kim A. Wagner's Amritsar 1919 and Anita Anand's The Patient Assassin to give her interpretation of the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and Udham Singh, respectively.
