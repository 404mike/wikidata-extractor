Much of his life was devoted to their direction, and to analyzing their observations. Other research focused on the birds of Greenland, ocean temperatures, the Gulf Stream, barometric measurement of heights, arc of the meridian, glacial transport of rocks, the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands, and various points of meteorology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 26", "response": ["*1883 \u2013 Edward Sabine, Irish-English astronomer, geophysicist, and ornithologist (b. 1788)"]}, {"page": "Sabine Baring-Gould", "response": ["Sabine was named after the family of his grandmother, Diana Amelia Sabine (died 1858), wife of William Baring-Gould (died 1846), daughter of Joseph Sabine of Tewin, Hertfordshire and sister of the Arctic explorer General Sir Edward Sabine.Graebe, Martin; \"Devon by Dog Cart and Bicycle: The Folk Song Collaboration of Sabine Baring-Gould and Cecil Sharp, 1904\u201317\", Folk Music Journal, Volume 9, Number 3, 2008, pp. 292\u2013348, ISSN 0531-9684.Wawman, Ron. \"Early Family Correspondence of Sabine Baring-Gould\", 2010.Vivian, p. 425.", "He married Grace Taylor on 25 May 1868 at Horbury.

This took much of the appeal from the concept, and efforts to adopt pendulum standards were abandoned."]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois Arago", "response": ["*Arago's Meteorological Essays, with introduction by Alexander von Humboldt, translated under the supervision of Colonel Edward Sabine (London, 1855)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of solar astronomy", "response": ["* 1852\u00a0\u2014 Edward Sabine shows that sunspot number is correlated with geomagnetic field variations"]}, {"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| Edward Sabine"]}, {"page": "Alexander von Humboldt", "response": ["The other two translations were made by Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine under the superintendence of her husband Col.

In the 20th century, scientists John Joly and Ernest Walton were also Anglo-Irish, as was the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.
