Subsequently appearing on albums by Klaus Doldinger's Passport, Mick Ronson, Leo Sayer, John Entwistle, Status Quo, and ex-King Crimson drummer Michael Giles, he went on to join Strawbs following the departure of John Hawken.\nIn the mid-eighties, Mealing did arrangements for several hit British albums by bands such as The Style Council and The Pet Shop Boys.\nBetween 1986 and 1993, he composed the music to the hit BBC Television quiz shows Every Second Counts and Bob's Full House.  He is credited with the music for the 1991 The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball.He is also credited as co-composer of the theme tune to the British TV comedy-drama series Press Gang which ran from 1989 to 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Press Gang", "response": ["The theme music was composed by Peter Davis (who after the second series composed the rest of the series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G.
