That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\" Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist\u00a0... There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".

Spears' vocals on the fifth track, \"Born to Make You Happy\" (which was released as the album's fourth single in Europe), span more than an octave. Its lyrics allude to a relationship that a woman desires to repair, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that \"I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy\". The sixth track and final single, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\", is a sentimental slow-tempo teen pop ballad. \"I Will Be There\" is a pop rock song that features a guitar riff similar to Natalie Imbruglia's \"Torn\" (1997), with a \"rousing chorus about standing by your man (or a best friend or a house pet)\", as noted by Kyle Anderson of MTV. The eleventh track, \"E-Mail My Heart\", is a sensitive piano ballad where Spears sings, \"E-mail me back/ And say our love will stay alive\". The cover of Sonny & Cher's 1967 single \"The Beat Goes On\" is influenced by bossa nova and trip hop, and features a similar sound to spy movies themes. Among the bonus tracks included on some editions of the album is a cover of J'Son's 1996 song \"I'll Never Stop Loving You\"."]}, {"page": "February 4", "response": ["*1975 \u2013 Natalie Imbruglia, Australian singer-songwriter and actress"]}, {"page": "Sneaker Pimps", "response": ["This significant lineup change caused Virgin Records to drop the band.
