In their 1999 paper, they raise several issues. One of which is that prototype theory does not intrinsically guarantee graded categorization. When subjects were asked to rank how well certain members exemplify the category, they rated some members above others. For example robins were seen as being \"birdier\" than ostriches, but when asked whether these categories are \"all-or-nothing\" or have fuzzier boundaries, the subjects stated that they were defined, \"all-or-nothing\" categories. Laurence and Margolis concluded that \"prototype structure has no implication for whether subjects represent a category as being graded\" (p.\u00a033)."]}, {"page": "Laurence", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence (born before 1998), American philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence"]}, {"page": "Steve Lawrence (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Stephen Laurence, scientist and philosopher"]}, {"page": "Stephen Lawrence (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Stephen Laurence, scientist and philosopher"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers of language", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers of mind", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence"]}, {"page": "Index of contemporary philosophy articles", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence"]}, {"page": "Index of analytic philosophy articles", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence"]}, {"page": "Linguistic development of Genie", "response": ["The scientists acknowledged that Genie's extreme emotional difficulties may have contributed to delaying her acquisition and willingness to use a few specific pieces of grammar, and at the beginning may have partially explained her very tacit demeanor. Nonetheless, in Curtiss and Fromkin repeatedly maintained that her emotional profile could not have impeded her ability to acquire language; they pointed out that she had clearly progressed in other aspects of her psychological development and was generally happy during their testing, and argued it was extremely implausible that emotional difficulties could interfere with her grammar acquisition without affecting her vocabulary. Several linguists, including Pinker and Derek Bickerton, accepted Curtiss and Fromkin's assessment while a few, including Stephen Laurence, questioned it but considered her case highly valuable. Other linguists, including Geoffrey Sampson, argued that the severity of her emotional difficulties made this extremely implausible and therefore negated much of the scientific significance ascribed to her case."]}, {"page": "List of University of Sheffield people", "response": ["* Stephen Laurence, philosopher and cognitive scientist"]}, {"page": "Laurence, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Laurence"]}]}}
