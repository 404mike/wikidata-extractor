For example, Henry Hall believed Akhenaten \"succeeded by his obstinate doctrinaire love of peace in causing far more misery in his world than half a dozen elderly militarists could have done,\" while James Henry Breasted said Akhenaten \"was not fit to cope with a situation demanding an aggressive man of affairs and a skilled military leader.\" Others noted that the Amarna letters counter the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. For instance, Norman de Garis Davies praised Akhenaten's emphasis on diplomacy over war, while James Baikie said that the fact \"that there is no evidence of revolt within the borders of Egypt itself during the whole reign is surely ample proof that there was no such abandonment of his royal duties on the part of Akhenaten as has been assumed.\" Indeed, several letters from Egyptian vassals notified the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions, implying that the pharaoh sent such instructions. The Amarna letters also show that vassal states were told repeatedly to expect the arrival of the Egyptian military on their lands, and provide evidence that these troops were dispatched and arrived at their destination. Dozens of letters detail that Akhenaten\u2014and Amenhotep III\u2014sent Egyptian and Nubian troops, armies, archers, chariots, horses, and ships."]}, {"page": "Great Hymn to the Aten", "response": ["In 1913, Henry Hall contended that the pharaoh was the \"first example of the scientific mind.\"H.

This appeared to historian Henry Hall as the most probable conclusion, particularly based on the portrayal of Sumerians in their own art and \"how very Indian the Sumerians were in type\". Recent genetic analysis of ancient Mesopotamian skeletal DNA tends to confirm a significant association that some of Sumerians might have come from IVC, and it cannot be excluded that among them were people involved in the founding of the Mesopotamian civilizations.50px Material was adapted from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: "]}, {"page": "Henry Reginald Holland Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Hall (Egyptologist) "]}, {"page": "Henry Reginald Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Hall (Egyptologist) "]}, {"page": "Harry Reginald Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Hall (Egyptologist) "]}, {"page": "\u00c9douard Naville", "response": ["In the 1890s he excavated at the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri where he was assisted by David George Hogarth, Somers Clarke and Howard Carter.
