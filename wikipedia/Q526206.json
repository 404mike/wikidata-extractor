For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in Wilfred Bion's theory is a basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member."]}, {"page": "Jacques Lacan", "response": ["After the war, the SPP recommenced their meetings. In 1945 Lacan visited England for a five-week study trip, where he met the British analysts Ernest Jones, Wilfred Bion and John Rickman. Bion's analytic work with groups influenced Lacan, contributing to his own subsequent emphasis on study groups as a structure within which to advance theoretical work in psychoanalysis.

Bowlby was trained psychoanalytically but was concerned about some properties of psychoanalysis and in response developed an alternative conceptualization of child behaviour based on principles on ethology. Holmes argues is that Attachment theories conceptualization is more testable than psychoanalysis. Bowlby's theory of attachment rejects Freud's model of psychosexual development based on the Oedipal model.  In response to his publications Bowlby was shunned from psychoanalytical circles who did not accept his theories, but this conceptualization was taken by mother infant research in the 1970s. Bowlby's work on attachment largely ignores internal (intrapersonal/ psychodynamic) aspects of psychology. Holmes argues that the work of Winnocott and Wilfred Bion carried out analogous work intrapersonally within psychoanalysis.", "Klein discusses the concept of introjection, creating a mental representation of external objects; and projection, applying this mental representation to reality.

Sandler, Hanna Segal, J. D. Sutherland and Donald Winnicott."]}, {"page": "Psychotherapy", "response": ["The term group therapy was first used around 1920 by Jacob L. Moreno, whose main contribution was the development of psychodrama, in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the US, such as Paul Schilder, who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably Wilfred Bion and Rickman, followed by S. H. Foulkes, Main, and Bridger. The Northfield Hospital in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two \"Northfield Experiments\", which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the therapeutic community movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings."]}, {"page": "Samuel Beckett", "response": ["Beckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published Proust, his critical study of French author Marcel Proust.

H. Foulkes and Wilfred Bion using group therapy as an approach to treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that transference can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out in the form of irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as group analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the Tavistock Clinic."]}, {"page": "The Queen's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Wilfred Bion, British psychoanalyst"]}, {"page": "Group dynamics", "response": ["===Wilfred Bion===", "Wilfred Bion (1961) studied group dynamics from a psychoanalytic perspective, and stated that he was much influenced by Wilfred Trotter for whom he worked at University College Hospital London, as did another key figure in the Psychoanalytic movement, Ernest Jones.

Opposed by his boss, Sir Aubrey Lewis, who wouldn't let him go, he joined the Tavistock group in the army, as a way of getting free, and was replaced by Hans Eysenck. Trist went to Edinburgh and worked on the War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs), with Jock Sutherland and Wilfred Bion.
