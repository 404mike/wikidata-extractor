His acts included giving lectures in an invented language called Slobodian, \"Imaginative Young Man with a Walking Stick\" and \"The Chairback\", with a broken chairback having a number of uses from comb to machine gun and taking on a demoniacal life of its own. Peter Sellers told him this was the inspiration for the prosthetic arm routine in Dr Strangelove. This act led to his engagement by Val Parnell to appear in the Starlight Roof revues starring Vic Oliver, where he met and married his second wife Clementina, with whom he had four children.

The first of these shows were actually called Crazy People and subtitled \"The Junior Crazy Gang\"; the term \"Goon\" was used as the headline of a review of Bentine's act by Picture Post dated 5 November 1948. Only one of this first series (and very few of the following three in which he did not appear) has survived, the rest of the original disc recordings having apparently been destroyed or discarded as no longer usable, so there is almost no record of his work as a radio \"Goon\". He also appeared in the Goon Show film Down Among the Z Men."]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Born in Southsea, Portsmouth, Sellers made his stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, when he was two weeks old. He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ShowTime, and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC radio shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show, which ended in 1960.", "By the end of 1948, the BBC Third Programme began to broadcast the comedy series Third Division, which starred, among others, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan. The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by Jimmy Grafton, who was also a BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him KOGVOS (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity) Grafton later edited some of the first Goon Shows.", "In 1960 Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir, in Anthony Asquith's romantic comedy The Millionairess, a film based on a George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not interested in the role until he learned that Sophia Loren would be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters, \"I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women\u00a0... She's a lot different from Harry Secombe.\" Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: \"Do you think I should divorce your mummy?\" There is uncertainty if the relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider it an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think it remained only a strong friendship. Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, \"I don't know to this day whether he had an affair with her. Nobody does.\" Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that \"He'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [daily] life.\" The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single \"Goodness Gracious Me\", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, \"Bangers and Mash\", reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart. That year he also appeared in Never Let Go (1960) playing a straight villain part.", "On 20 April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All, which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz, Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was \"a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction.\" Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that \"I just can't walk on as myself\". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, \"was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity\". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.", "Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers \"had the genius comparable to Chaplin\", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as \"a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.\" Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that \"Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain\u00a0... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything\". Director Blake Edwards thought that \"Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing\". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said \"I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him\"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, \"Anything to avoid paying for dinner\". Secombe later declared to journalists \"Bluebottle is deaded now\". Milligan later said that \"it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time.\"", "A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellers's old friend, Canon John Hester. Sellers's final joke was the playing of \"In the Mood\" by Glenn Miller, a tune which all the Goons hated; he knew they would have to sit there in silence and listen to it. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 September 1980\u2014what would have been Sellers's 55th birthday.

After being demobilised, Milligan remained in Italy playing with the trio but returned to Britain soon after. While he was with the Central Pool of Artists (a group he described as composed \"of bomb-happy squaddies\") he began to write parodies of their mainstream plays, which displayed many of the key elements of what would later become The Goon Show (originally called Crazy People) with Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine.", "Milligan returned to jazz in the late 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying to break into the world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show. After a delayed start, Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, The Goon Show. During its first season the BBC titled the show as Crazy People, or in full, The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons!, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang. p. 186.", "Even late in life, Milligan's black humour had not deserted him. After the death of Harry Secombe from cancer, he said, \"I'm glad he died before me, because I didn't want him to sing at my funeral.\" (A recording of Secombe singing was played at Milligan's memorial service.) He also wrote his own obituary, in which he stated repeatedly that he \"wrote the Goon Show and died\"."]}, {"page": "The Goon Show", "response": ["Milligan and Harry Secombe became friends while serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first encountered Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe was sitting in a small wireless truck: \"Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the middle of it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan.\"  Secombe's answer to that question was \"What colour was it?\" Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.:20", "It was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that The Goon Show broke the most new ground.  Part of the problem was that \"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head\u00a0\u2013 he just knew when it had not yet happened\".:205 An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard\u00a0\u2013 which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\").:205Harry Secombe, in Ventham (2002) p.19. The socks-filled-with-custard story has been frequently cited since at least the 1970s, when it was reiterated in newspaper articles Secombe noted that \"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each\u00a0\u2013 chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens\u00a0\u2013 all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\" An FX instruction in one script read \"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\".  Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted  from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.:205", "*Harry Secombe's characters", "As well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing of raspberries entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter.  In the Goons' musical recording \"The Ying-Tong Song\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone.  Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \"Donkey\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\" as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts.  This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke.

He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that \"my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it\". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85\u00a0days during 1957\u201358, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He said he fought and ran \"just as [he] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro\". Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne, as well as taking codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and \"their attitude made me extremely angry and when I get angry\u00a0... I just go completely off my nut\". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For much of the rest of 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called \"Filling the Gap\"; the show ran for a total of 380\u00a0performances between May and December 1958.

Broadcast from 1951 to 1960, radio comedy The Goon Show, starring Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. The show has exerted considerable influence on British comedy and culture. As a film star Sellers in particular became influential to film actors by using different accents and guises and assuming multiple roles in the same film. Comedian Marty Feldman co-created the acclaimed BBC Radio comedy programme Round the Horne in 1965. The long running radio comedy Just a Minute first aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1967. Panellists must talk for sixty seconds on a given subject, \"without hesitation, repetition or deviation\". Guests over the years have included Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard and Sue Perkins. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, the science fiction comedy radio series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was innovative in its use of music and sound effects. The BBC, as a public service broadcaster, also runs minority stations such as BBC Asian Network, BBC Radio 1Xtra and BBC Radio 6 Music, and local stations throughout the country.
