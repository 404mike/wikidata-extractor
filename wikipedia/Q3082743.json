Runyon almost totally avoids the past tense (English humorist E.C.

BentleyIntroduction to More Than Somewhat, included in omnibus volume Runyon on Broadway (1950), Constable comments that \"there is a sort of ungrammatical purity about it [Runyon's resolute avoidance of the past tense], an almost religious exactitude.\"  There is an homage to Runyon that makes use of this peculiarity (\"Chronic Offender\" by Spider Robinson) which involves a time machine and a man going by the name \"Harry the Horse\"."]}, {"page": "John Cleese", "response": ["Also in 1965, Cleese and Chapman began writing on The Frost Report.

While working on The Frost Report, the future Pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant.

The subjects that excited him most were football and politics, though his actual knowledge of either was limited. He used language not considered acceptable for television in the 1960s. He often referred to racial minorities as \"coons\" and similar terms. He referred to his Liverpudlian son-in-law as \"Shirley Temple\" or a \"randy Scouse git\" (Randy Scouse Git, as a phrase, caught the ear of Micky Dolenz of the Monkees who heard it while on tour in the UK and used it as the title of the group's next single\u2014though their record label renamed it 'Alternate Title' in the UK market to avoid controversy), and to his wife as a \"silly [old] moo\" (a substitute for 'cow' which was vetoed by the BBC's head of comedy Frank Muir). However, Michael Palin writes in his diary for 16 July 1976 that Warren Mitchell told him that \"silly moo\" was not scripted, \"It came out during a rehearsal when he forgot the line 'Silly old mare'.\" Controversially, the show was one of the earliest mainstream programmes to feature the swear word 'bloody'. The show was one of many held up by Mary Whitehouse as an example of the BBC's moral laxity.See, for example, her responses to an episode referred to as \"Bird Fancier\" (first transmitted on 20 September 1972), which features a discussion of the Virgin birth of Jesus, as detailed in Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse, London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1979, pp. 110\u201316.

Lord Hill had previously been the chairman of the Independent Television Authority and ensured that that station (ITV) remained relatively controversy-free. He shared many of the same opinions as Mrs Whitehouse and the wider NVLA, which also clashed with the opinions of the then BBC Director General, Hugh Carleton-Greene (he is quoted as having the \"utmost contempt\" for Hill), who had been the series' biggest champion and gleefully ignored Mrs Whitehouse whenever he had to. Many other members of BBC Management also voiced their opinions directly to Hill over his appointment, most notably the then Controller of BBC-2, David Attenborough, who compared Hill being Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors to \"giving Rommel the command of the Eighth Army\". It should be added that neither Hill, nor his predecessor, Normanbrook, had any direct influence over the series itself (as the BBC Charter prohibits this), but their relationship with the Director-General indirectly influenced the programme. Because of his total personality and culture clash with Hill, Greene resigned in July 1968 (soon after the series ended its original run) and, with the series' biggest champion now out of the BBC, it looked like the Garnett family would be making no more new appearances on BBC Television, at least for the time being. Another champion of the series - Head of Comedy output at the BBC, Frank Muir had resigned his post between the second and third series to take up a new, similar, post at David Frost's fledgling new ITV franchise London Weekend Television, which would launch on 2 August 1968. His replacement - Michael Mills - recognised that the series had enormous potential but didn't understand why it had to be so topical, controversial or full of swearing and blasphemy, which hugely irritated Speight.", "Given the problems the series had given the BBC with steep pay increases in them midst of a Government-imposed public sector pay freeze, scripts being delivered in varying degrees of completeness (and sometimes not at all), several court cases (usually libel or blasphemy), hundreds of complaints, several run-ins with Mary Whitehouse and her NVLA, the loss of the series' two biggest champions (first Frank Muir then Hugh Carleton-Greene), the new management having different opinions over the programme and the general stress its production placed on staff (primarily down to the incomplete scripts submitted by Speight), all despite its ratings success over ITV (particularly over Coronation Street) in its first two series and its general popularity as a whole, contributed to the BBC getting cold feet over the programme.

His explanation: Nero and Cicero had rose gardens next to each other. The tender of Nero's garden had a mishap and destroyed a whole row of roses. So he sneaked over to Cicero's garden, stole a row from there and replaced the ones missing in his master's garden. However, they were white, while the ones in Nero's garden were pink or \"rose-colored\". When Nero saw this he wrote a note to the gardener: \"Our roses are rose. Is a row Cicero's?\" He has also rendered it as \"Arrows sees Harrow's Ciceros\" in a spin-off book You Can't Have Your Kayak and Heat It."]}, {"page": "Graham Hill", "response": ["Hill's easy wit and charm helped him become a television personality, notably on the BBC show Call My Bluff with Patrick Campbell and Frank Muir. For a number of years in the early 1970s he appeared as one half of a double act, with Jackie Stewart, as an insert within the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show. In June 1975 he appeared alongside his son, Damon Hill, on the popular television programme Jim'll Fix It. His appearance was later rebroadcast as part of the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the programme in January 1995, with Damon presenting a new segment at the end."]}]}}
