Unexpectedly, but in most cases of their own will, women began appearing on the battlefront in the middle of the ravages of war. Some of them took up arms (Milunka Savi\u0107, Sofija Jovanovi\u0107, Antonija Javornik, Slavka Tomi\u0107 and others) defending their fatherland no differently than men, showing surprising courage and valour. A larger number of women started volunteering in military and civilian hospitals. They were housewives, artists (Nade\u017eda Petrovi\u0107), writers (Danica Markovi\u0107), doctors (like Draga Ljo\u010di\u0107), semi-skilled nurses, caretakers, teachers; some of them were highly-educated and others were not as fortunate but they were astute, skillful and quick-learners. What they had in common was an intense loyalty to their country and love for their people that su\ufb00ered utter devastation during the Great War. Most Serbian nurses had completed crash courses on looking after the ill and wounded at in-patient clinics or makeshift military \ufb01eld hospitals and ad hoc dressing stations. Draginja Babi\u0107, Ljubica Lukovi\u0107, Kasija Mileti\u0107 and Mirka Gruji\u0107 worked as members of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, whereas others were organized as part of the Red Cross mission in Serbia and abroad to solicit aid (Helen Losanitch Frothingham). Women from foreign countries, the members of international medical missions, were also of great support to Serbian volunteers in their e\ufb00ort to help others. During the early stages of the conflict foreign missions arrived in Serbia from Great Britain and Scotland, the United States of America, France, Imperial Russia Switzerland, Australia, Denmark and the Netherlands. The members of the missions were mostly women \u2013 trained doctors and nurses \u2013 and they ran entire hospitals in the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro.

Together with their \u201cSamaritan sisters\u201d from Serbia, they used their medical knowledge and experience to help the Serbian army and in this way, they became part of the modern history of a small country from the Balkans and of the people who su\ufb00ered the tragic Great Retreat over the treacherous Albanian mountains in the middle of 1915-1916 winter.
