Crisp (born 1972) is a British writer and publisher of supernatural fiction. Unlike the better-known personality of the same name, this Quentin Crisp was given the name at birth but, being younger, must use his middle initial to disambiguate. Originally from North Devon, Crisp now lives in London. He has a bachelor's degree in Japanese from the University of Durham, has spent two periods living in Japan and Japanese literature is a significant influence in his work.\nCrisp is responsible for the Ch\u00f4mu Press, publishing fiction by contemporary authors.\nCrisp also writes lyrics, which have been recorded by Kodagain.\nHis novella Shrike was a 2009 Shirley Jackson Award finalist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Fantasy Award", "response": ["*Chomu Press, Quentin S.
