He appears in the first series, set shortly after The Wars of the Roses. He is the second son of the fictional King Richard IV of England (Brian Blessed), who, we are told at the beginning, was cast from all historical references by his successor, Henry Tudor (Peter Benson). Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants: he is slow-witted, cowardly, and the butt of the other characters' jokes. While he is as devious and amoral as his descendants, his Machiavellian schemes are usually spurred on by other characters. For all this he is determined and driven to power: his primary concern is to seize the English throne and become the king-himself. After the death of Richard IV and Edmund's older brother Harry (Robert East), he is briefly King of England; a lyric from one of the closing credits for Black Adder II describes him as \"a king / Although for only thirty seconds\". Prince Edmund is one of the many Blackadders to be killed on screen: he dies after accidentally drinking poisoned wine, although he had already been severely mutilated by his childhood nemesis, the Duke of Burgundy (Patrick Allen)."]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| Caligula || Produzioni Atlas Consorziate (P.A.C.) / Analysis Film Releasing Corporation / Penthouse Films International / Felix Cinematografica || Tinto Brass (director/screenplay); Giancarlo Lui, Bob Guccione (directors); Malcolm McDowell, Teresa Ann Savoy, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Guido Mannari, Patrick Allen, Giancarlo Badessi, Adriana Asti, Leopoldo Trieste, Paolo Bonacelli, Joss Ackland, John Steiner, Mirella D'Angelo, Richard Parets, Osiride Pevarello, Anneka Di Lorenzo, Bruno Brive, Paula Mitchell, Donato Placido, Lori Wagner, Valerie Rae Clark, Susanne Saxon, Jane Hargrave, Carolyn Patsis, Bonnie Dee Wilson || Historical, Drama || Live action", "| The Sea Wolves || Paramount Pictures / Rank Film Distributors || Andrew V.
