He was appointed by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour to hold an investigative enquiry into the conduct of the Boer War in 1902 to 1903. The Elgin Commission was the first of its kind in the British Empire, and it travelled to South Africa and took oral evidence from men who had actually fought in the battles.  It was the first to value the lives of the dead and to consider the feelings of mourning relatives left behind, and it was the first occasion in the history of the British Army that recognised the testimony of ordinary soldiery as well as that of the officers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Winston Churchill", "response": ["In the new government, Churchill became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office, a junior ministerial position that he had requested. He worked beneath the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, and took Edward Marsh as his secretary; Marsh remained Churchill's secretary for 25 years. Churchill's first task was helping to draft a constitution for the Transvaal; and he helped oversee the formation of a government in the Orange Free State. In dealing with southern Africa, he sought to ensure equality between the British and Boer. He also announced a gradual phasing out of the use of Chinese indentured labourers in South Africa; he and the government decided that a sudden ban would cause too much upset in the colony and might damage the economy. He expressed concerns about the relations between European settlers and the black African population; after the Zulu launched their Bambatha Rebellion in Natal, Churchill complained about the \"disgusting butchery of the natives\" by Europeans."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for the Colonies", "response": ["| The Right HonourableVictor Bruce9th Earl of ElginKG GCSI GCIE PC(1849\u20131917)", "* Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin \u2013 born in Canada during his father's, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, term as Governor General of Canada and a British appointee"]}, {"page": "James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin", "response": ["*Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin (1849\u20131917)"]}, {"page": "First Commissioner of Works", "response": ["| Victor Bruce9th Earl of Elgin(1849\u20131917)"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin"]}, {"page": "Order of the Crown of India", "response": ["*1894: The Countess of Elgin (wife of Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, Viceroy of India, 1894\u20131899)"]}, {"page": "Ibrahim of Johor", "response": ["Sultan Ibrahim was also facing political challenges from the British colonial government, who were ostensibly unhappy his negligence in his state affairs and were seeking to extend greater political influence into the state.
