He represented Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in 1994 and 1998. He was a relay medallist at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics and at the 1998 European Athletics Championships he claimed a 200 metres/relay gold medal double.\nEducated at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, in 1998 he became European champion in both 200 metres and 4x100 metres relay. With 31.56 seconds he is the European record holder in 300 metres, although this distance is rarely run.\nHe failed a drugs test in 1998 for the anabolic steroid nandrolone, but was cleared of all charges by a UK Athletics disciplinary committee in 1999. IAAF later overturned that decision and he received a two-year doping ban in 2000. Despite an attempted comeback following his suspension, the ban effectively ended his elite level athletics career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Julian Golding", "response": ["At the 1998 European Athletics Championships, Golding was favourite to win the gold medal in the 200 metres.  After running a series of fast times and winning both heats and semi-finals convincingly, he was beaten by teammate Dougie Walker in the final, winning a bronze medal."]}]}}
