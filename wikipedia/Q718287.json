In his flat in Tottenham in north London, Oldfield recorded demos of four tracks he had been composing in his head for some years, using the tape recorder, his guitar and bass, some toy percussion instruments, and a Farfisa organ borrowed from the Whole World's keyboardist David Bedford. The demos comprised three shorter melodies (early versions of what would become the sections titled \"Peace\", \"Bagpipe Guitars\", and \"Caveman\" on Tubular Bells 2003 (2003)), and a longer piece he had provisionally titled \"Opus One\". Oldfield stated that he had been inspired to write a long instrumental piece after hearing Septober Energy (1971), the only album by Centipede.
