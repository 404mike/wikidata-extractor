The manoeuvre created a yard of space for him to deliver a curling shot from . Reporters were impressed by his overall performance in the match, especially by his desire, confidence, and ability with both feet. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri remarked after the match that Milner had performed like a much more experienced player.

With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, speculation grew as to whether he would re-sign: an opinion piece in the local paper in the new year suggested that Danns was one of a small group of players who \"aren't putting in 110%\" and who should be a priority for new manager Dougie Freedman to get \"playing from the same tune\", and the player made a lengthy response via social media dismissing any suggestion that he was not giving his all for the club or that his recently acquired back problem was chronic and would make him fail a medical.

Three months later both he and teammate Adam Clayton were dropped from the first team amid rumours of a training ground bust-up between the pair where Paterson was alleged to have punched Clayton.
