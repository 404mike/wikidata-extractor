Sturrock's first game in charge saw Yeovil face Notts County but despite taking the lead through a Haydn Hollis own goal a late Garry Thompson equaliser saw Yeovil suffer back-to-back relegations. With relegation already confirmed Yeovil faced play-off chasers Sheffield United, on 14 April, and recorded a 1\u20130 win thanks to a Stephen Arthurworrey goal. Yeovil then traveled to face promotion-chasing Swindon Town on 18 April, before the match manager Paul Sturrock confirmed the departure of player/goalkeeper coach Gareth Stewart with immediate effect due to financial cutbacks. A first goal for the club from midfielder James Berrett helped Yeovil to another 1\u20130 victory, their first successive victories since December 2013. On 21 April, Yeovil faced Bridgwater Town in the semi-final of the Somerset Premier Cup goals from James Hayter and a double from Fergus Bell helped Yeovil to a 3\u20131 win and a place in the final. Yeovil's final home game of the season saw the first defeat of Sturrock's reign with Port Vale winning the match 2\u20131 with Gozie Ugwu scoring Yeovil's only goal. After the game Yeovil's annual end of season awards, saw midfielder Sam Foley completing a near clean sweep winning five of the seven awards. Yeovil's league season ended with a 5\u20131 defeat away at Milton Keynes Dons, in a game which saw their opponents promoted as runners-up. On 7 May, Yeovil faced Southern League side Taunton Town in the final of the Somerset Premier Cup, with Yeovil naming no substitutes on the bench for the fixture. The club lost the match 1\u20130 after extra time."]}]}}
