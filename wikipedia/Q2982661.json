They consider the forest to be their great protector and provider and believe that it is a sacred place. They sometimes call the forest \"mother\" or \"father\". An important ritual that impacts the Bambuti's life is referred to as molimo. After events such as death of an important person in the tribe, molimo is noisily celebrated to wake the forest, in the belief that if bad things are happening to its children, it must be asleep. As with many Bambuti rituals, the time it takes to complete a molimo is not rigidly set; instead, it is determined by the mood of the group. Food is collected from each hut to feed the molimo, and in the evening the ritual is accompanied by the men dancing and singing around the fire. Women and children must remain in their huts with the doors closed. These practices were studied thoroughly by British anthropologist Colin Turnbull, known primarily for his work with the tribe."]}, {"page": "Ik people", "response": ["In 1972, anthropologist Colin Turnbull published an ethnography about the Ik titled The Mountain People. This research provides an examination of Ik culture/practices based on information he gathered during a 1965\u201366 study. He depicts the Ik as a people forced into individualism to survive. Although Ik consider non-productive individuals such as the elderly and infirm to be burdens on the society, a few remaining elderly Ik are used as sources for his descriptions of the former Ik society (including hunter-gatherer practices, marriage, childbirth, death rituals/taboos, religious/spiritual beliefs, and other aspects). Although quickly out-dated by their rapidly-evolving culture, much of the research focused on the then-current condition of the Ik people during a severe famine during a drought.Turnbull, Colin M.
