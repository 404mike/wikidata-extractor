One of his foremost roles as a barrister was to assist in the prosecution of former Malawian president Hastings Banda. As a member of the New York Bar he has worked as a volunteer with the American Civil Liberties Union. He has also specialised in freedom of information issues.Born in London in 1964 of Pakistani and Finnish parents, Kadri studied history and law at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first, and has a master's degree from Harvard Law School.Kadri's parallel travel writing career started with a visit to Prague during the 1989 Velvet Revolution, as one of only a handful of 'non-journalists' who actually observed the reality of the changes without being hamstrung by press conferences and filing deadlines. He stayed on in Prague for two years to pen the groundbreaking Cadogan Guide to that city. His 2005 book, The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O. J. Simpson was written after two and a half years spent in Manhattan, having arrived shortly before September 11, 2001. He was inspired to write his 2012 work Heaven on Earth, by the September 11, 2001 and July 7, 2005 bombings. Critics have called that book \"extremely valuable\" and \"entertaining\", \"carefully researched\", and \"thorough and admirable\".He currently lives in London and writes law-based articles for the British current affairs magazine New Statesman, and the London Review of Books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crucifixion", "response": ["The corpus of hadith provides contradictory statements about the first use of crucifixion under Islamic rule, attributing it variously to Muhammad himself (for murder and robbery of a shepherd) or to the second caliph Umar (applied to two slaves who murdered their mistress). Classical Islamic jurisprudence applies the verse 5:33 chiefly to highway robbers, as a hadd (scripturally prescribed) punishment. The preference for crucifixion over the other punishments mentioned in the verse or for their combination (which Sadakat Kadri has called \"Islam's equivalent of the hanging, drawing and quartering that medieval Europeans inflicted on traitors\") is subject to \"complex and contested rules\" in classical jurisprudence. Most scholars required crucifixion for highway robbery combined with murder, while others allowed execution by other methods for this scenario.
