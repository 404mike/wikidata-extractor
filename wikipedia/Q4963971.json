The American Soccer League collapsed following the 1983 season.  This led to the creation of the United Soccer League in 1984. The Slickers joined the new league, changing their name to the Oklahoma City Stampede.  The club once again came tantalizingly close to a league championship, winning the regular-season title on point differential over the Fort Lauderdale Sun but falling in the semifinals to the Houston Dynamos in a three-game series. This success was short-lived. After the 1984 season, the club relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma at the Tulsa Tornados, with Brian Harvey still serving as head coach. The USL folded in the spring of 1985 after just a handful of games. During its short existence, Oklahoma City's best-known players were goalkeeper Phil Parkes and Jeff Bourne, both veterans of the North American Soccer League and English First Division.
