Also in 1926, he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm verbally abused his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who then walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy, and as a result, an official ban was requested to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was \\upset by the count's actions, and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again."]}, {"page": "Gladys Colston", "response": ["Gladys was born Blanche Gladys du Bois Duddell to George Duddell and Frances Kate du Bois. Her father was a property owner who became wealthy doing business in Hong Kong. Her mother was her father's great-niece. She had an older brother William Duddell who was a physicist and inventor. She married British Army officer Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway in 1904, thereby becoming Lady Roundway.
