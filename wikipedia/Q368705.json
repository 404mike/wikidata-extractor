Public pressure for answers increased and on 13 June 1861, the Exploration Committee agreed to send a search party to find the Burke and Wills expedition and, if necessary, offer them support. The Victorian Contingent Party left Melbourne on 26 June 1861 under the leadership of Alfred William Howitt. At the Loddon River, Howitt met Brahe, who was returning from Cooper Creek. As Brahe did not have knowledge of Burke's whereabouts, Howitt decided a much larger expedition would be required to find the missing party. Leaving three of his men at the river, Howitt returned to Melbourne with Brahe to update the Exploration Committee. On 30 June, the expanded expedition left to follow Burke\u2019s trail.

The name Kaurna was not recorded until 1879, used by Alfred William Howitt in 1904, but not widely used until popularised by Norman B. Tindale in the 1920s. Most likely, it is an exonym introduced from the Ramindjeri or Ngarrindjeri word kornar meaning \"men\" or \"people\"."]}, {"page": "Tom Wills", "response": ["Since the 1980s, it has been suggested that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed \"football's history wars\". In her essay \"A Seductive Myth\", published in the AFL's The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an \"emotional belief\" lacking \"any intellectual credibility\". She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as \"Min'gorm\". De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, \"or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game\". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best."]}, {"page": "Band society", "response": ["Band was one of a set of three terms employed by early modern ethnography to analyse aspects of hunter-gatherer foraging societies. The three were respectively 'horde,' 'band', and 'tribe'. The term 'horde', formed on the basis of a Turkish/Tatar word \u00fard\u00fa (meaning 'camp'), was inducted from its use in the works of J. F. McLennan by Alfred William Howitt and Lorimer Fison in the mid-1880s to describe a geographically or locally defined division within a larger tribal aggregation, the latter being defined in terms of social divisions categorized in terms of descent. Their idea was then developed by A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, as a model for all Australian indigenous societies, the horde being defined as a group of parental families whose married males all belonged to the one patrilineal clan. 'Horde' from the outset bore stereotypical connotations of Australian Aboriginal societies as primitive, closed, rigid and simple, and came to be discarded not only for its implication of 'swarming savages' but also because it suggested a fixed tribal-territorial entity which compromised the actual field data, the field data allowing for a far more fluid concept of the group."]}, {"page": "Eliza Forlonge", "response": ["Alfred William Howitt, Australian anthropologist, explorer and naturalist, described her as 'one of the pleasantest and most energetic ladies I have ever met with'."]}, {"page": "Ngarrindjeri", "response": ["Taplin's list of 18 lakinyeri Each lakinyeri had its own nga:tji/ngaitji. was further finessed by Alfred William Howitt, drawing on information he obtained from Taplin, and listing 20.
