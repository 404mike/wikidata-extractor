He made repeated attempts to get work in the London listings magazine Time Out. When the premiership of Margaret Thatcher began in May 1979, its news editor Duncan Campbell invited Bell to meet the need for a comic strip on the new government. Maggie's Farm, with animal characters, appeared in Time Out from 1979 to May 1981, then from October 1981 in City Limits. Bell produced another comic strip, Lord God Almighty, for The Leveller during 1980 and 1981. In 1980 he contributed a cartoon interpretation of the lyrics to Ivan Meets G.I.

Due to its location, it could get direct reports about developments in Indonesia. According to Duncan Campbell, Indonesia had used sabotaged cypher machines supplied by the Swiss company Crypto AG which had built-in back doors for GCHQ and the CIA, allowing them to decode and read secret Indonesian messages \"without difficulty\". With its spies based in Singapore, Britain took advantage of a failed coup by the 30 September Movement that resulted in the murder of six senior Indonesian generals. The British encouraged the Indonesian Army campaign of mass killings after the attempted coup, through spreading anti-Communist propaganda and material. Such content was used to inflame and encourage the destruction of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Hundreds of thousands of members of the PKI were murdered. According to Norman Reddaway the GCHQ material at Chia Keng could have helped Indonesian generals to persecute the PKI. This was done to undermine Sukarno and his government and to try to end the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, a conflict over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia. The conflict ended after Sukarno relinquished his power to Suharto."]}, {"page": "David Koff", "response": ["Occupied Palestine, perhaps the first film to look critically at the roots of conflict between Zionism and the Palestinian national movement for control of the land of historical Palestine.

Tucker opened an account with \u00a3500 in December 1970 and two months later he rented a safety deposit box in the branch; over the next few months he visited his box thirteen times. Bank practice of the time was for staff to leave customers in private while visiting the vault. As soon as Tucker was alone, he would measure the room using the span of his arms and an umbrella he brought with him; he was aided in getting exact measurements by the regularly sized floor tiles, each of which was  square. He drew a map of the room, plotting where the cabinets were and the position of the furniture. Thomas Stephens, another second-hand car salesman with no criminal record, was used to acquire the tools needed for the break-in, including a thermal lance and a 100-ton jack; one of Reader's friends, Bobby Mills, was employed to be the lookout man. Two others were brought in for the job, one of whom was an explosives expert. Another of Gavin's friends, Mickey \"Skinny\" Gervaise, a burglar-alarm expert, was brought on board, as were two men who have never been identified: \"Little Legs\" and \"TH\". Lashmar reports that TH was a contact of Detective Inspector Alec Eist, whom he describes as \"by reputation the most corrupt Yard officer of the 1950s to mid-1970s\". The journalist Duncan Campbell describes Eist as \"One of the most active bent officers from the 1950s to the 1970s\".", "There have been several rumours circulating about the burglary. One is that the government issued a D-Notice\u2014a formal request that the media do not publish a story on a specific subject for reasons of national security\u2014to stop any news being released. The claim is dismissed by Duncan Campbell who writes \"no D-Notice was even requested, far less granted\"; the journalist Graeme McLagen observes that there was a news embargo on the Sunday\u2014while the burglary was still in progress\u2014but that the events were widely reported over the following days. Another rumour is that one of the safety deposit boxes contained compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and the actor and criminal John Bindon. Campbell describes the story as \"cheerful nonsense\". A third rumour is that photographs of a Conservative cabinet minister abusing children were discovered by the gang and left behind for the police to find, but no action was taken."]}, {"page": "The Guardian", "response": ["* Duncan Campbell"]}, {"page": "Duncan Campbell (crime journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Alec Eist", "response": ["Likewise, the intelligence scholar Duncan Campbell suggests that Eist was \"one of the most active bent officers\" of the period.
