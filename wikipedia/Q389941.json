He was born at Edinburgh on 21 May 1813, was educated at the University and at the Divinity Hall of his native city, and was assistant at Larbert and Dunipace. A mission of inquiry among the Jews throughout Europe and in Palestine, and a religious revival at his church in Dundee, made him feel that he was being called to evangelistic rather than to pastoral work, but before he could carry out his plans he died, on 25 March 1843. McCheyne, though wielding remarkable influence in his lifetime, was still more powerful afterwards, through his Memoirs and Remains, edited by Andrew Bonar, which ran into far over a hundred English editions. Some of his hymns became well known and his Bible reading plan is still in common use.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Robert Murray M'Cheyne (1813\u20131843), minister of the Gospel, missionary to the Jewish people"]}, {"page": "1843", "response": ["* March 25 \u2013 Robert Murray M'Cheyne, Scottish clergyman (b. 1813)"]}, {"page": "1813", "response": ["* May 21 \u2013 Robert Murray M'Cheyne, Scottish clergyman (d. 1843)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Christian missions", "response": ["* 1838 \u2013 Church of Scotland Mission of Inquiry to the Jews; four Scottish ministers including Robert Murray M'Cheyne and Andrew Bonar journey to Palestine; Augustinians enter Australia."]}, {"page": "Ruthwell", "response": ["During his youth, Robert Murray M'Cheyne spent summer holidays at Clarence Cottage in the hamlet of Clarencefield near Ruthwell, the home of his maternal aunt.
