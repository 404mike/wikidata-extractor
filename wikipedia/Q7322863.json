The seven inch version of this mix appears on the album The White Room. The main B-side was a dub-based version of the same song, \"3 a.m. Eternal (Guns of Mu Mu)\", featuring the bassline from The Clash's \"Guns of Brixton\". Concurrent with the chart-topping version, yet another 12-inch was released, with resolutely underground remixes by The Moody Boys.", "There are two video versions for the SSL video. The American version includes an opening with a travel through the mythical \"Land of Mu Mu\" where the KLF are performing inside a pyramid scenery with singers in a stadium.
