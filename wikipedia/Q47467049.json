When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: Joy Noble and Fiona Johnston,   Many low-income countries' economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support."]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's coxed four", "response": ["| Fiona JohnstonKate GroseJoanne GoughSusan SmithAlison Norrish"]}, {"page": "Kate Grose", "response": ["The following year she was a member of the eight that won the national title rowing for a A.R.A squad at the 1987 National Championships and rowed in her second World Championships in Copenhagen.
