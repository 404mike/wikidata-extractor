She was associated at some point with the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis; a Rosicrucian and mystical organization, and her books were a part of the foundation of today's corpus of esoteric philosophy. Her portrait was painted by Helen Donald-Smith."]}, {"page": "William Robert Grove", "response": ["Grove was a careful, painstaking and accurate judge, courageous and not afraid to assert an independent judicial opinion. However, he was fallible in patent cases, where he was prone to become overinterested in the technology in question and to be distracted by questioning the litigants as to potential improvements in their devices, even going so far as to suggest his own innovations. He retired from the bench in 1887. His portrait was painted by Helen Donald-Smith in the 1890s."]}, {"page": "Donald Smith", "response": ["*Helen Donald-Smith, English Victorian artist"]}, {"page": "H Donald Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Helen Donald-Smith"]}, {"page": "H.
