In Coyle's first cup final in charge he gave up the right to lead the team out, instead he asked long serving Kitman Teddy Horner have this honour.", "Roy Coyle won 16 trophies with Glentoran and is the club's most successful manager in the club's history.", "After eight years in charge of Glentoran, Roy Coyle resigned as manager after a string of indifferent results. On 14 February 2006 the club announced that former Newry City manager Paul Millar was to take over the manager's position. Since taking over, performances improved and he led his team into the Irish Cup final with rivals Linfield. Despite taking the lead in the first half, Linfield won the game with two goals from Peter Thompson. He also led his new club to their biggest ever defeat against their bitter cross-city rivals Linfield in a 6\u20130 defeat at Windsor Park. The Glens have sought to reduce the gap between them and Linfield by signing Kyle Neill and Gary Hamilton from Portadown and re-signing former fan's favourite Gary Smyth. Also arriving was another former player, Jason Hill, former Portadown and Newry City player Cullen Feeney and promising young keeper Ciaran McLaughlin from Ards.", "In March 2010, after McDonald resigned, former player Scott Young was put in charge of the Glens until the end of the 2010\u201311 season along with Pete Batey as assistant manager and Tim McCann as head coach. Young led Glentoran into the 2009\u201310 Irish League Cup final against Coleraine. The bannsiders were the favourites for the match but the Glens were the team who came out victorious, winning 4\u20131 on penalties after the match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. At the end of the season, Young along with Batey and McCann signed a deal with the Glens to stay on as manager. Former Glentoran manager Roy Coyle, who brought a huge amount of success, became director of football.", "Young started his second season very well, with a 2\u20131 win away to Crusaders. However, the 2011\u201312 season would turn out to be disappointing for Young and the club. Rory Patterson was set to come back at the club, but could not agree on the contract following the finance problems. Patterson joined Glentoran's bitter rivals Linfield. However, Matty Burrows returned to the club, but struggled to maintain his place. The club then started to go through a run of poor results and started to lose supporters. Despite beating Linfield three times, Glentoran lost in the County Antrim Shield final to Cliftonville and continued their losing streak in the league. Then on 14 January 2012, Glentoran were knocked out of the 2011\u201312 Irish Cup by Amateur league side Newington Youth Club. Young then resigned after the game. Director of Football Roy Coyle was put in charge for the match against Ballymena United.", "After defeating Carrick Rangers 2\u20130 at home news had broke that Eddie Patterson had been sacked.  A club statement was then released explaining that the current position in the table wasn't at best interest from club and fans as the club is under pressure to make progress year on year.

After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle went on to become the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1\u20130 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2\u20131 in the 1975\u201376 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976\u201377 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they lost 4\u20131 against Coleraine. The 1977\u201378 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3\u20131 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.", "When the 2014 Setanta Sports Cup was confirmed in December 2013, the club opted not to enter the competition, citing inconvenient fixture scheduling, reduced prize money, and the difficulties faced for Linfield supporters to attend away games as the reasons behind their withdrawal. At the time, the club did not rule out future participation, however, they would never enter the competition again. League champions Cliftonville also withdrew from the competition for similar reasons, with the next two highest placed sides from the previous season's league table (Ballinamallard United and Coleraine) being drafted in as replacements. In February 2014, Jeffrey announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the 2013\u201314 season, bringing an end to his trophy-laden reign after 17 years. In March 2014, the Blues lifted the County Antrim Shield for a record 43rd time by defeating Crusaders 4\u20131 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time in the final. This was a significant milestone for Jeffrey \u2013 his 31st and last trophy as Linfield manager, equalling Roy Coyle's record. Jeffrey still had the opportunity to win a record-breaking 32nd trophy as manager in the form of the 2013\u201314 league title. However, despite topping the league table for much of the season, the Blues had to settle for the runners-up spot, six points behind champions Cliftonville. Jeffrey's reign came to a winning end with a 5\u20132 victory over Glenavon on the final day of the 2013\u201314 league season.", "Below is a list of the managers Linfield have appointed during the club's history. In the early years after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by the club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. Since then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed since Billy Campbell's departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Roy Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, having led the club to 31 major honours each.
