He attended Lozells Street School, and played football for local sides Guildford Street and Lozells before joining Football League Second Division champions Small Heath in August 1893. He made his debut on 2 September, the opening day of the 1893\u201394 season, playing at right back in a 3\u20131 win at home to Walsall Town Swifts, and scored two goals the following week playing on the right wing, but appeared only rarely for the first team, deputising for Caesar Jenkyns or Ted Devey in the half-back line, during that and the next season. Playing for the reserve team in the Birmingham & District League in 1895, he scored a hat-trick of own goals. After Jenkyns left, Jolley had a run of games at his preferred position of centre half at the start of the 1895\u201396 season, but lost his place and left for Berwick Rangers (Worcester) in September 1896.", "link_mentions": {}}}
