He attended Lozells Street School, and played football for local sides Guildford Street and Lozells before joining Football League Second Division champions Small Heath in August 1893. He made his debut on 2 September, the opening day of the 1893\u201394 season, playing at right back in a 3\u20131 win at home to Walsall Town Swifts, and scored two goals the following week playing on the right wing, but appeared only rarely for the first team, deputising for Caesar Jenkyns or Ted Devey in the half-back line, during that and the next season. Playing for the reserve team in the Birmingham & District League in 1895, he scored a hat-trick of own goals. After Jenkyns left, Jolley had a run of games at his preferred position of centre half at the start of the 1895\u201396 season, but lost his place and left for Berwick Rangers (Worcester) in September 1896.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Speller", "response": ["When training resumed for the 1893\u201394 season, full-back Tom Bayley had been released, but the Post expected Speller to take his place. He had played in practice matches and was \"fully confident of his ability to perform as well as ever he did\". Teddy Jolley and newcomer Bernard Pumfrey began the season at full back, but a defeat at Liverpool and a heavy defeat at Burslem Port Vale gave Speller his chance. His first game for almost a year came in a visit to Ardwick, won 1\u20130 by Small Heath. According to the Post, \"he played carefully at the start, but gained confidence as the game proceeded, and many times put a stop to extremely dangerous attacks by the clever right wing of the home team.\" He played in the next game, a 5\u20132 win at home to Grimsby Town, then lost his place to William Reynolds. At Christmas, Small Heath played a friendly at Marlow, in which Speller had \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken\". Nevertheless, he retired at the end of the season. Before he broke his leg, he had not missed a game in League or FA Cup since the ankle injury some two-and-a-half years earlier."]}, {"page": "Teddy Jolly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Teddy Jolley"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["On 20 March, Small Heath played West Bromwich Albion in a benefit match for captain Caesar Jenkyns. Teddy Jolley made his first appearance for the club, and a relatively strong side whose forwards \"were very quick on the ball, and passed remarkably well\", notably Wheldon, who \"as usual, played brilliantly\", won 5\u20130 in front of about 4,000 spectators. In an uneventful penultimate League match of the regular season, Small Heath won 3\u20130 at the Athletic Ground against Burslem Port Vale, Walton opening the scoring just before half-time with a penalty kick. The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent now predicted that Sheffield United would win their remaining four matches, all away from home, to take the divisional title on goal average."]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71. Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and was believed to be back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 85, 102. and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 8\u20139. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal blue shirt and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket and navy stockings.", "Small Heath opened their second season in the Football League with a visit to Walsall, who were playing at Wednesbury because their new ground was not yet ready. Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley was one of several newcomers for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who \"dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal\". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3\u20131. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30\u00a0seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15\u00a0minutes later the visitors were 3\u20132 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a \"friendly and sportsmanlike spirit\" was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, \"the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground\". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was \"almost certain\" never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6\u20131 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back.", "While most of the Second Division clubs were involved in FA Cup qualifying ties, Small Heath, who had received a bye to the first round proper, lost a friendly match against Everton reserve team by five goals to nil. Everton's near neighbours Liverpool complained to the League that the game adversely affected the attendance at their home fixture with Newcastle, but the League confirmed that Everton were within their rights to arrange the match. \"Better forward play [had] rarely been witnessed at Lincoln than that shown by Small Heath\" in a 5\u20132 defeat of Lincoln City, whose defence failed to cope with the industry and creativity of Teddy Jolley feeding the \"light but nimble\" forwards, Mobley in particular. The next weekend, numerous matches were postponed or abandoned because of the weather. Although the Small Heath and Crewe Alexandra players were changed and ready to play, the referee would not start the game because the \"blinding snowstorm would prevent him from having a proper sight of the play\"."]}, {"page": "Jolley (surname)", "response": ["* Teddy Jolley (1871\u20131895), English footballer"]}]}}
