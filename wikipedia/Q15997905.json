He was born in Welford, Northamptonshire on 12 January 1875 and died in Swinford, Leicestershire on 24 April 1950. He appeared in 205 first-class matches as a wicketkeeper and right-handed batsman. He scored 2,670 runs with a highest score of 101 not out, his only century, and claimed 402 victims including 116 stumpings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Bellamy", "response": ["In his youth, Bellamy focused chiefly on soccer, at which he was good enough to play for Northampton Town as an inside forward. Bellamy joined the ground staff of Northamptonshire, which shared its ground with the soccer club, in 1912, but his powers as a cricketer ripened very slowly indeed. He was denied a regular place in the county team until 1922, due to the First World War and the long career of Walter Buswell. By this time he was thirty-one years old. Bellamy then remained the first choice wicket-keeper for 14 seasons, making his last appearance for the county as a batsman with Ken James having become the preferred wicket keeper."]}]}}
