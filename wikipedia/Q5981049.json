He then had a short spell at Hurlford United before moving to Kilmarnock, where he spent seven years as a semi-professional whilst still working on his parents farm. Bryson made almost 200 appearances for \"Killie\", mostly as a midfielder.\nBryson then got a breakthrough in the pre-season of 1988, when Dave Bassett offered Bryson a trial at Sheffield United. Bryson's trial was successful and he played a crucial part in two successive promotions from the old Third Division, through to the old First Division in 1990. Bryson remained a regular for United in the top flight, assisting and scoring crucial goals, notably a double in a 3\u20132 victory over Nottingham Forest, which was the first win of the season after 17 games without a win.After 5 successful years at United, Bryson left for a brief spell at Barnsley, before he joined Preston North End in 1993 on his 31st birthday, where he briefly played alongside a young David Beckham.\nBryson was appointed captain of the north west club. Although Preston lost the Third Division playoff final 4\u20132 to Wycombe Wanderers, Bryson himself scored with a spectacular overhead kick. Two years later he led them to the Third Division title, lifting the trophy at Deepdale in front of a capacity crowd. Bryson ended his professional league career at Rochdale, later playing for Bamber Bridge.\nHe is still remembered with great affection at both Sheffield United and Preston. After retiring, Bryson spent a spell coaching youngsters at North End's academy. Ian still lives in Preston and still plays regularly for AC Sporting in the Preston area Veterans League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian bryson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Bryson"]}, {"page": "Hurlford", "response": ["* Ian Bryson \u2013 Sheffield United F.C., Barnsley F.C., Preston North End F.C, and Rochdale A.F.C. footballer"]}, {"page": "Hurlford United F.C.", "response": ["| Ian Bryson || Kilmarnock, Sheffield Utd and Preston"]}, {"page": "Darren Beckford", "response": ["Norwich manager Dave Stringer had been looking to sign a regular goalscorer for some time, and when Beckford signed he described him as \"the answer to the Norwich supporters prayers\". His spell at Carrow Road was inconsistent, however, and he only scored 13 times in 49 appearances. Supporters in particular criticised the fact that many of these goals were scored against weaker opposition in the League Cup. The highlight of his time at Norwich was his hat-trick in a 4\u20133 win against Everton \u2013 a victory which would prove key to the Canaries avoiding the drop in 1991\u201392. That season he also proved to be a versatile player, taking over in goal when Bryan Gunn sustained a back injury during a game against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. He made a number of fine saves but was finally beaten Ian Bryson in a 1\u20130 defeat."]}, {"page": "Bryson (surname)", "response": ["*Ian Bryson (born 1962), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1990s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Ian Bryson"]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["The referee for the match, played in front of 40,109 spectators, was Keith Cooper.
