William Alexander, who stayed behind in Beijing, expressed regret at being unable to see the Wall for himself. Under Macartney's orders, Lieutenant Henry William Parish of the Royal Artillery made a survey of the Great Wall's fortifications with his men, thereby contributing to the intelligence-gathering aspect of the mission, though at the expense of arousing suspicion among their Chinese hosts. Some of the men, meanwhile, took bricks from the Wall as souvenirs. Past the Great Wall, the terrain became more mountainous and difficult for the men's horses to traverse, slowing their progress. The entourage arrived at the outskirts of Chengde on 8 September.", "thumb|The Approach of the Emperor of China to His Tent in Tartary to Receive the British Ambassador, by William Alexander (1793)", "Although the Macartney Embassy returned to London without obtaining any concession from China, the mission could be termed a success in that it brought back detailed observations of a great empire.

This multi-volume work was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney and from the papers of Sir Erasmus Gower, who was Commander of the expedition.

The Illustrator William Alexander published several books on the customs and dress of the Chinese based on the commercial success of his illustrations of the Macartney Mission. With the increasing demand for tea in Britain, pressures on trade and prosperity grew, causing British accounts on China to turn critical. Fellow crewmembers on the Macartney Mission, such as Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet, published later reports describing the same Embassy in a negative light. This can be explained, in part, as a reaction to growing British frustrations over trade."]}]}}
