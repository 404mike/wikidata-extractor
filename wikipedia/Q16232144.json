Accordingly, it has played an important part in creating the early reputations of musicians as diverse as The Sixteen, solo and chamber pianist Christine Croshaw, clarinetist Anna Hashimoto, tenor Ian Partridge, pianist John Bingham, the Lindsay Quartet, Onyx Brass, and organist David Sanger, among others. Distinguished musicians from all over the globe have recorded on the label including a series of releases by pianist Fou Ts'ong (\"the greatest living Chinese performer\" according to Timeout magazine), as well as South African virtuoso double-bassist Leon Bosch - a favourite on Classic FM, BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4."]}]}}
