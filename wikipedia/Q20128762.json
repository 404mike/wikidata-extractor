After the war some returned to their former pursuits, such as Hugh Lloyd-Jones, who became Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford and was knighted, and Maurice Wiles, who became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. Others abandoned their former interests and became sinologists or japanologists, such as David Hawkes, later Professor of Chinese at Oxford, Geoffrey Bownas, later Professor of Japanese at Sheffield University, and Albert Richard Davis, who became Professor of Chinese at Sydney University. Some became famous for other reasons, such as Denise Newman, who served as the only female skipper in the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service for eight years, and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic in 1988 at the age of 64, and Wilfrid Noyce, who was a member of the 1953 British Everest Expedition and later died in a mountaineering accident in the Pamirs.For biographies of all the students see Kornicki 2019."]}]}}
