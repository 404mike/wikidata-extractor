From the beginning The Jetset presented themselves as being as famous as their heroes The Monkees. The band's marketing sowed the seeds of the Jetset myth before they were even well known. Their eye-catching EP sleeve included the band clowning around in stills \"from their forthcoming TV series\", hanging out of the Monkee-influenced 'Jetsetmobile' (a Ford Capri with customised 'JETSET' number plates). On the musical side, Bevoir had penned a quartet of tunes for the EP, including \"The Jetset Theme\", billed as an 'original soundtrack recording'. With an inspired promotional push, the EP was sent to the press accompanied by merchandise including Jetset posters, badges, stickers, key rings and bubblegum cards. Mod fanzines followed suit, helping to stoke the fires of Jetsetmania. Soon a Jetset cartoon strip appeared in Shadows & Reflections, the underground magazine of long-time Jetset champion Chris Hunt. The group even released their own Christmas flexi-disc through Shadows & Reflections in December 1983.Elkins, Alfie, Jetset Biog., 2004, Paul Bevoir Official Site."]}, {"page": "The Universe of Geoffrey Brown", "response": ["*Paul Bevoir - backing vocals (1)"]}, {"page": "Bevoir, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Bevoir"]}]}}
