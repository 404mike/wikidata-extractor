His first event was the 1981 International Open in which he beat Jim Donnelly 5\u20134 in Round 1, Murdo MacLeod 5\u20131 in Round 2 and received a walkover against John Pulman in Round 3. In Round 4 Johnson beat Jim Wych 5\u20133 and then lost in Round 5, the last 32, 5\u20133 to Graham Miles. In the 1981 UK Championship Johnson began the event with a comprehensive 9\u20131 win over Tommy Murphy in Round 2. This was followed by a Round 3 9\u20133 defeat of Mike Watterson and in Round 4 a 9\u20134 win over Cliff Wilson. In round 5 Johnson beat the former three-time world champion John Spencer 9\u20135 and this earned Johnson a last 16 appearance at the UK Championship against another former world champion, Ray Reardon, to whom Johnson narrowly lost 9\u20137. At the 1982 International Masters, Johnson began the event in the pre-qualifying group stage with a 2\u20131 loss against Dave Martin, and 2\u20130 wins over both Geoff Foulds and Cliff Wilson. The results were enough to take Johnson into the next qualifying round where he lost 2\u20131 to John Virgo, but beat John Spencer 2\u20131 and Dave Martin (again) 2\u20130. In the third and final group stage Johnson lost 2\u20130 to Dennis Taylor and Reardon but beat Virgo 2\u20131, but the win was not enough to take Johnson out of the group stage. In Round 1 of the 1982 World Championship Johnson beat Vic Harris 9\u20134 and reached the last 48, where he lost 9\u20138. After a 2\u20130 Round 1 defeat by Jackie Rea in the 1982 Bass and Golden Leisure Classic Johnson ended the season with no ranking points, \u00a32,950 prize money \u2013 25th in the money list, but was again unranked."]}, {"page": "List of snooker players", "response": ["*Geoff Foulds"]}, {"page": "Neal Foulds", "response": ["The son of snooker professional Geoff Foulds, he began playing the game at the age of 11 and by the early 1980s was already one of the strongest players in his area.
