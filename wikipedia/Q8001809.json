However that was to remain his best performance. He played three more games in the season when Derbyshire failed to win a match. He played six games in 1921 when under Guy Jackson the team moved up to 12th in the Championship. In 1922 he played two games for Cambridge University and twelve games for Derbyshire who reached 11th in the championship,  accompanying Wilfred Hill-Wood in both teams. In 1923 he played two games for Derbyshire and  ten for Cambridge University culminating in the Varsity match which that year, was nicknamed the \"Thunderstorm match\". Oxford ran up a high score before overnight storms created a very sticky wicket and the Cambridge team which included Gubby Allen and Claude Ashton were quickly dismissed in two innings. Tomlinson played one game for Derbyshire in 1924 and then stayed with club cricket. He was a right-arm medium pace bowler and took 58 first-class wickets with an average of 32.24 and a best performance of 5-53. He was a right-hand batsman and played 65 innings in 38 first-class matches with a top score of 66 and an average of 14.94.William Tomlinson at Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "Eton v Harrow", "response": ["Many famous individuals and famous cricketers have played in the match.
