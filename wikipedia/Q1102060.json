In 1880, he published the magnificent folio Monograph of the Genus Lilium, instigated by Elwes and written with assistance from J. G. Baker at Kew Gardens, but he wrote disappointingly little about his gardening experiences. To ensure that the text was as accurate as possible, and that the range of lilies was as complete as possible, he consulted the greatest botanical experts in the field for help in writing the text. This level of excellence was perpetuated in the illustrations, and Elwes was able to execute his plan to illustrate the monograph with hand-coloured plates by the best available botanical artist, with each member of the genus shown full size. Between March 1877 and May 1880 subscribers received seven parts (at a total cost of seven guineas), illustrated with 48 plates by Walter Hood Fitch (1817\u20131892). In his garden he was able to grow many of the members of the genus Lilium, becoming a recognised expert in the field. However, Elwes played down his level of knowledge. Some botanists found him a domineering personality. N.D. Riley noted that Elwes \"was a giant of a man and a very dominating character.\" W.T. Stearn noted that his booming voice (which made one commentator quip - \"is that a man or a foghorn?\") which carried well across his Gloucestershire estate was disconcerting elsewhere."]}, {"page": "1817 in art", "response": ["*February 28 \u2013 Walter Hood Fitch, Scottish-born botanical artist (died 1892)"]}, {"page": "Curtis's Botanical Magazine", "response": ["When Curtis died, having completed 13 volumes (1787\u20131800), his friend John Sims became editor between 1801 and 1807 (Volumes 15\u201326) and changed the name.

These seeds were distributed to a number of gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B.\u00a0speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented \"We found neither the whiteness of the under side of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species\". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B.\u00a0victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: \"There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B.\u00a0speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B.\u00a0speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B.\u00a0Victori\u00e6 of Meisner.\" Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B.\u00a0victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis."]}, {"page": "Banksia nobilis", "response": ["In addition to plant specimens, Drummond also sent seeds of D.\u00a0nobilis to England.

The flowering specimen was about seven years old at the time, and about four feet high. It became the basis for a lithographed plate by Walter Hood Fitch, which was featured in Volume 78 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine.

Despite her limited artistic training, Hooker encouraged her to show the magazine her own work, and in 1878 it first published one of her drawings. A dispute over pay between Fitch and Hooker\u2014for whom Fitch had been preparing illustrations for several books\u2014led to Fitch's leaving the long-running magazine in 1877. One consequence was that Smith rapidly became a key illustrator at the magazine, at first working alongside Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer. In the period 1879\u20131881, each issue included some 20 of her drawings, and by 1887 she was almost the sole illustrator for the magazine. In 1898, she was appointed the magazine's sole official artist. Over the forty-odd years between 1878 and 1923, Smith drew more than 2,300 plates for the magazine\u2014only 600 fewer than Fitch, although she received much less recognition for this achievement in her own lifetime. As late as the mid 20th century, art teacher Wilfrid Blunt, in his book The Art of Botanical Illustration, dismissed her as an artist of inferior skills, praising her faintly for her charm, her work ethic, and her usefulness in creating a record of otherwise unpictured plants. In this he follows a pattern first noticeable in the Victorian era of progressively devaluing botany and botanical art as women entered the field professionally. Other authors, however, both now and in her own day, have admired the clarity and precision of her drawing, and her four decades of employment at the center of the British botanical world testifies to a continuing value for her skills."]}, {"page": "Fitch (surname)", "response": ["* Walter Hood Fitch (1817\u20131892), Scottish botanical artist"]}, {"page": "List of florilegia and botanical codices", "response": ["* 1836\u201376 Icones Plantarum William Jackson Hooker (1785\u20131865) Walter Hood Fitch (1817\u20131892) Matilda Smith (1854\u20131926)", "* 1837\u201341 Amsterdam The Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala James Bateman (1811\u20131897) Walter Hood Fitch (1817\u20131892) Sarah Drake (1803\u20131857) Mrs Withers M.
