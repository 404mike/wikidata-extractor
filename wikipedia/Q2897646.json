For example, in 1979 Bernard Carr and Martin Rees argued that the principle \u201cis entirely post hoc: it has not yet been used to predict any feature of the Universe.\u201d Others have taken objection to its philosophical basis, with Ernan McMullin writing in 1994 that \"the weak Anthropic principle is trivial ... and the strong Anthropic principle is indefensible.\" Since many physicists and philosophers of science do not consider the principle to be compatible with the scientific method, another explanation for the flatness problem was needed."]}, {"page": "Curley (film)", "response": ["Bernard Carr was the film's director, and the film released to theatres on August 23, 1947 by United Artists.

His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics. Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.

Broad, H.H. Price and Bertrand Russell. A second book, The Walls of Plato\u2019s Cave, followed in 1994 (17) on the same topic. Robert Almader's (29) described the work as \"This is certainly one of the four or five most arresting and compelling books written on the nature of consciousness, the mind-brain problem, and human personality.\" The theory extends our concepts of consciousness and analyses possible geometrical and topological relations between phenomenal space and physical space linked to brane theory in physics. In 2008, the distinguished British physicist Bernard Carr (30), following a different line of research, presented a very similar theory as the basis for a necessary new paradigm shift in cosmology. In 1998 he wrote Every Person's Guide to Antioxidants (37).
