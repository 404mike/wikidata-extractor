They made an immediate return to the third tier after securing a Third Division automatic promotion place in 2000\u201301. Relegated in 2006\u201307, they secured the League Two title in 2010\u201311, but were relegated from League One the following season. In 2011, Dave Allen took full ownership of the club and oversaw progress to two League Trophy finals; Chesterfield won the trophy with a 2\u20130 victory over Swindon Town in 2012, and finished as runners-up after losing 3\u20131 to Peterborough United in 2014. Chesterfield were crowned champions of League Two for a record fourth time in 2013\u201314, but remained in League One for just three seasons.

On 14 November 2016, majority shareholder Dave Allen resigned from his roles as chairman and director of the club. This signalled a crisis, and four days later a further four directors resigned from their roles. It was announced that Chesterfield was openly up for sale, and desperately needed some kind of investment in order to avoid administration. Mike Warner was installed as chairman on 19 November. On 8 January 2017, manager Danny Wilson was sacked, with Gary Caldwell being announced as his replacement nine days later. On 16 September 2017, manager Caldwell was sacked after three wins in 29 competitive games, giving him the worst win record of any Spireites manager. On 29 September 2017, club legend Jack Lester was appointed the club's new manager, bringing with him Nicky Eaden as his assistant and former caretaker manager Tommy Wright as a first team coach. In the Spireites first season in the national league they achieved a 14th-place finish.", "Ownership of Chesterfield FC changed hands on 6 August 2020 with the Chesterfield FC Community Trust buying the club outright from previous owner Dave Allen. On 7 August 2020 Chesterfield FC Community Trust rewarded John Pemberton by appointing him full-time manager of the club following a spell as caretaker manager from January 2020 where he prevented relegation from the National League. Chesterfield sacked John Pemberton in late November 2020 following a poor start to the 2020/21 campaign that resulted in 2 wins and 7 defeats from the first 9 games, leaving Chesterfield in real danger of relegation from the National League. The Community Trust took action following a late 2\u20133 defeat at home to Notts County on 21 November 2020, conceding 2 goals in injury time. Selection of the new manager would involve input from numerous sources, with the club deciding on young manager James Rowe, who had taken Gloucester City to 1st place in the National League North. On January 8, the fifth-tier side had a memorable experience, facing defending UEFA Champions League winners Chelsea in the third round of the FA Cup, who fielded a near full-strength squad, with the side managing to score a goal in a 5-1 defeat to the Premier League side."]}, {"page": "David Allen", "response": ["David or Dave Allen may refer to:", "* Dave Allen (comedian) (1936\u20132005), Irish comedian", "* Dave Allen (actor) (born 1958), American television and film actor", "* Rockin' Dave Allen (1941\u20131985), American blues guitarist and singer", "* Dave Allen (born 1952), flautist in Australian rock band Flake", "* Dave Allen (English musician) (born 1955), bassist for 1970s rock band Gang of Four", "* Dave Allen (died 1986), guitarist and vocalist for punk band NOFX, 1990s and 2000s", "* Dave Allen, American bassist for rock band Glassjaw, 1990s and 2000s", "* Dave Allen, lead singer and guitarist for Irish rock band Hal, 2000s", "* Dave Allen (rugby league), rugby league pro footballer during 1980s", "* Dave Allen (football executive) (born 1942), British sports businessman", "* Dave Allen (boxer) (born 1992), British boxer"]}, {"page": "Owlerton Stadium", "response": ["It is operated by the A & S Leisure Group, the majority shareholder of which is Dave Allen.
