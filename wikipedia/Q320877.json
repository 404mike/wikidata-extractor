He was educated at University College London (UCL) where he was Henry Head Research Fellow of the Royal Society before being appointed Professor of Neurobiology. Since 2008 he has been Professor of Neuroesthetics at UCL.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Visual cortex", "response": ["The firing properties of V4 were first described by Semir Zeki in the late 1970s, who also named the area.  Before that, V4 was known by its anatomical description, the prelunate gyrus.  Originally, Zeki argued that the purpose of V4 was to process color information.  Work in the early 1980s proved that V4 was as directly involved in form recognition as earlier cortical areas.  This research supported the two-streams hypothesis, first presented by Ungerleider and Mishkin in 1982.", "A standard view is that V1 provides the \"most important\" input to MT. Nonetheless, several studies have demonstrated that neurons in MT are capable of responding to visual information, often in a direction-selective manner, even after V1 has been destroyed or inactivated. Moreover, research by Semir Zeki and collaborators has suggested that certain types of visual information may reach MT before it even reaches V1."]}, {"page": "Color vision", "response": ["From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the \"thin stripes\" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only  V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO. Area V4 was initially suggested by Semir Zeki to be exclusively dedicated to color, and he later showed that V4 can be subdivided into subregions with very high concentrations of color cells separated from each other by zones with lower concentration of such cells though even the latter cells respond better to some wavelengths than to others, a finding  confirmed by subsequent studies.  The presence in V4 of orientation-selective cells led to the view that V4 is involved in processing both color and form associated with color but it is worth noting that the orientation selective cells within V4 are more broadly tuned than their counterparts in V1, V2 and V3. Color processing in the extended V4 occurs in millimeter-sized color modules called globs. This is the part of the brain in which color is first processed into the full range of hues found in color space."]}, {"page": "Balthus", "response": ["He co-authored a book of dialogues with the neurobiologist Semir Zeki, entitled La Qu\u00eate de l'essentiel."]}, {"page": "Semir zeki", "response": ["#REDIRECT Semir Zeki"]}, {"page": "Neuroesthetics", "response": ["Neuroesthetics (or neuroaesthetics) is a relatively recent sub-discipline of empirical aesthetics.
