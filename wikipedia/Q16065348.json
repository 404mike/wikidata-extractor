As a cricketer, he was often a lower-order batsman and usually a bowler, though he later batted as an opener and it is not always clear, from incomplete records, that he bowled in every game. Equally, it is not known if he hatted right- or left-handed, and nor is his bowling style recorded, though his obituary in The Times states that he bowled left-handed. He made an immediate impact in early matches for the Cambridge side in 1851: in his first game, he took six Cambridge Town Club wickets in the first innings, though the complete record for this game has not survived. He was picked for the University Match against Oxford University and took 10 wickets in the game, which Cambridge won by an innings and four runs."]}, {"page": "Pontifex (surname)", "response": ["  to John Pontifex, of West Wycombe, Bucks, and his wife Alice.
