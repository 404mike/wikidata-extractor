In 1839 he was at the Surrey Theatre. He was called on at short notice to take over the title-role on opening night in Michael William Balfe\u2019s production of Scaramuccia at the English Opera House, owing to the 'incapacitation' (a contemporary euphemism for 'drunk')  of Adam Leffler. He went on an operatic tour of the provinces with Emma Romer and the tenor John Templeton, with Stansbury singing the baritone and bass roles, including Hela in The Mountain Sylph, Rodolfo in La sonnambula, Figaro in The Marriage of Figaro and Dulcamara in The Love Spell. In 1841 he was to return to the Surrey Theatre as chef d'orchestre, where he was to remain for the last four years of his life. At the same time he continued to sing in concerts and commenced a career as a teacher of voice, for a time tutoring Hamilton Braham, the son of John Braham, who would later find success as a bass."]}]}}
