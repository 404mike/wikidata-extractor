As an educator, he initiated innovative policies at Lambeth School of Art (later the South London Technical School of Art) where he was Superintendent of Studies. Married in 1868 in Lambeth to Catherine Adelaide Sparkes (1842-1891), Catherine was also a leading Art Potter who exhibited at the annual exhibitions of Howell James & Co. In 1870, Henry Doulton became a mentor to Lambeth School of Art and Sparkes proposed that Lambeth and Doultons Art Pottery collaborate.
