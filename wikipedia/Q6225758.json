He trained at the National Art Training Schools as an art teacher. As an educator, he initiated innovative policies at Lambeth School of Art (later the South London Technical School of Art) where he was Superintendent of Studies. Married in 1868 in Lambeth to Catherine Adelaide Sparkes (1842-1891), Catherine was also a leading Art Potter who exhibited at the annual exhibitions of Howell James & Co. In 1870, Henry Doulton became a mentor to Lambeth School of Art and Sparkes proposed that Lambeth and Doultons Art Pottery collaborate. Some prominent students of this collaborative work include the Barlow Sisters who began under Doulton in 1871.\nHe was in charge of the Royal College of Art (including National Art Training School) 1875 to 1898, with the title of Headmaster from 1875 to 1881, and  Principal from 1881 to 1898.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lambeth School of Art", "response": ["Soon after John Charles Lewis Sparkes started teaching at Lambeth in 1857, he began to cultivate a connection between the school and Henry Doulton's neighbouring pottery works. In 1863 Henry Doulton joined the school's board of management and in 1864 he gave the school its first commission, for a terracotta frieze for the pottery's new extension. Doulton forged a strong relationship with the school, exhibiting experimental works by students at the 1867 Paris Exhibition and the 1871 London Exhibition. From about 1869, Sparkes and his staff developed a curriculum that trained students for the pottery trade, and to carry out design work for Doulton. The continuing collaboration provided Royal Doulton with a supply of higher-quality artwork for its trade, and gave students at Lambeth School of Art employment opportunities. Many noted English modelers and sculptors owe their careers to this partnership."]}, {"page": "City and Guilds of London Art School", "response": ["In 1857 John Charles Lewis Sparkes started teaching at the art school, soon becoming its Headmaster. Under Sparkes City and Guilds of London Art School was at the forefront of opposition to the monopoly claimed by the Royal Academy of Arts on the teaching of fine art practices, particularly drawing from the human figure. An attempt had been made to resolve this conflict in 1852, with the introduction by the British Government of the National Course on Instruction for art and design education, which was in effect a national curriculum for art training. This allowed for some elements of drawing to be taught, but within a broader curriculum that stressed the teaching of techniques to aid workers in artisan manufacturing industries rather than the training of artists.", "* John Charles Lewis SparkesJohn Charles Lewis Sparkes"]}, {"page": "Sparkes", "response": ["*John Charles Lewis Sparkes (c.1833\u20131907), British art educator"]}, {"page": "China painting", "response": ["For the duration of the china painting craze, between about 1880 and 1920, many books on pottery making, focusing on painting, were published for the amateur in England and America, for example, A Handbook to the Practice of Pottery Painting by John Charles Lewis Sparkes, Headmaster of the National Art Training School and director of the Lambeth School of Art."]}]}}
