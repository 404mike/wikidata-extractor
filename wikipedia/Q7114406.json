He is best remembered for his roles in Mozart and Britten operas and for his recordings of roles in Britten, Offenbach and Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as well as recordings of English folk songs.\nBrannigan began as an amateur singer and attended music college part-time, while working as a joiner, until his quality was recognised and he was awarded a scholarship during World War II.  Although he had an international opera career, he performed most frequently with English opera companies, particularly Sadler's Wells opera, and later at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden.  Highlights of his broad repertory included creating three roles in Benjamin Britten's early operas, and two more in later Britten operas that were written specifically for him.  On record and in concert at the Proms he was a popular interpreter of the bass-baritone roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  Brannigan's oratorio and concert repertory was extensive, covering works from many periods.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Guildhall School of Music and Drama", "response": ["* Owen Brannigan (1908-1973), bass"]}, {"page": "My Music (radio programme)", "response": ["* 1973: Ian Wallace and Denis Norden versus Owen Brannigan and Frank Muir"]}, {"page": "English National Opera", "response": ["In November 1937, Baylis died of a heart attack.
