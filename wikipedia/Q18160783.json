Molly was the barmaid daughter of the publican of the old Rose Inn (not on the site of the present one). She was well known to local Binfield man, Alexander Pope, who, during a storm, found himself stranded at the inn with his friends, Gay, Swift and Arbuthnot. They wrote the ballad extolling her virtues to pass the time. Wokingham is the setting of Lars Iyer's 2019 novel Nietzsche and the Burbs. The character of Tom the chimney sweep in Charles Kingsley's classic childhood story The Water Babies was based on the life and times of a Wokingham boy called James Seaward, who was a boy sweep in Victorian times. In his later years, Seaward swept the chimneys at Charles Kingsley's home at the Rectory in Eversley, Hampshire. Seaward was elected Alderman of Wokingham from 1909 until his death in 1921. He had 12 children. The Water Babies are the subject of Wokingham's first public sculpture, installed in 1999, which graces the upper-level entrance to Wokingham Library."]}, {"page": "Exodus", "response": ["*Exodus, a 2013 novel by Lars Iyer"]}, {"page": "Dogma (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Dogma, a 2012 novel by Lars Iyer"]}, {"page": "Lars", "response": ["*Lars Iyer (born 1970), British novelist and philosopher"]}, {"page": "Spurious", "response": ["* Spurious, a 2011 novel by Lars Iyer"]}, {"page": "Believer Book Award", "response": ["*Lars Iyer, Spurious"]}, {"page": "Goldsmiths Prize", "response": ["|Lars Iyer"]}, {"page": "Endorsements in the 2019 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["* Lars Iyer, novelist and philosopher"]}]}}
