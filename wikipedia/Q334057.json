Their marriage was said to be based on \"perfect intellectual sympathy\"; Millicent pursued a writing career while caring for Henry, and ran two households, one in Cambridge, one in London.

Their only child was Philippa Fawcett, born in 1868, who was much encouraged by her mother in her studies.

His next major work was again an innovation in terms of size: The Fawcett memorial (1885\u201387) featured a bronze bust of politician Henry Fawcett above seven small detailed figures of around fifteen inches, which individually represented Fawcett's virtues. The memorial received praise from critics when it was unveiled at Westminster Abbey on 29 January 1887. By then Gilbert had been commissioned to produce another memorial, this time for Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, which was placed in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. From the late 1880s to the mid-1890s he was in his most creative period. He diversified into goldsmithing and damascening, making an epergne (1887\u20131890) given to Queen Victoria by officers of the British Army and a chain for the mayor of Preston (1888\u20131892). Gilbert produced medals, such as the cast bronze portrait of Matthew Ridley Corbet (1881) and the struck bronze medal marking 50 years of the Art Union of London (1887). He also created spoons, cups, dishes and jewellery; many of his designs can be seen in the collection of Stichting van Caloen on display at Loppem Castle. Marion Spielmann, a contemporary art critic, wrote in 1901 \"his taste is so pure, his genius so exquisitely right, that he may give full rein to his fancy without danger where another man would run riot and come to grief\"."]}, {"page": "Robert Hunter (civil servant)", "response": ["A leading member of the Commons Preservation Society during this period was the Liberal politician Henry Fawcett.

Hunter's fitness for the post was confirmed by independent advisers and he was appointed on 1 February 1882. Fawcett later said that nothing in his official career had given him more satisfaction than securing a man of Hunter's character and ability for the service of the nation."]}, {"page": "Michael Davitt", "response": ["Davitt's views on land reform were based on a pre-capitalist understanding of access to land for subsistence farming to be a human right that superseded property rights, the so-called \"unwritten law\". He believed that the landlord system was feudal in nature and had been imposed on Ireland by the British. His ideas were also heavily shaped by his association with Henry George, and he cited thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, Henry Fawcett and Bonamy Price in his writings advocating radical land reform. Davitt came to agree with George that tenancy reform would not achieve \"land for the people\". In addition, even peasant proprietorship would fall short of this goal. Davitt foresaw that public funds spent on land purchases would never benefit landless labourers, and believed that the resulting smallholdings would eventually be consolidated into estates. Instead, from 1882, Davitt advocated for compulsory land nationalisation with compensation for current owners, so that all ground rent could be reclaimed by the state and used on public projects to benefit all citizens. According to Marxist historian Peter Linebaugh, Davitt's ideas inspired James Connolly's \"Celtic communism\"."]}, {"page": "Rector of the University of Glasgow", "response": ["|1883\u20131884 || Henry Fawcett|| || economist and parliamentarian"]}, {"page": "More Letters of Charles Darwin", "response": ["* Henry Fawcett"]}, {"page": "Edward Linley Sambourne", "response": ["Henry Fawcett, "]}, {"page": "Second Gladstone ministry", "response": ["| Henry Fawcett"]}, {"page": "John Lowther du Plat Taylor", "response": ["He proposed at his regiment's 1872 annual prize giving the formation of a reservist Telegraph and Postal CorpsDaily News (London, England), Thursday, 30 May 1872 and in 1877 the War Office established a committee  \"to consider the formation of a Corps for the performance of Postal Duties in the Field\".Public Records Office WO/33/30 The War Office rejected the committee's recommendation that such an organisation should be formed, reasoning that it would be too expensive.
