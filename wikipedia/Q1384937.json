He spent his career at Durham University, where he was appointed Lecturer in 1885.   He was, successively, Censor of St Cuthbert's Society between 1897 and 1901 succeeding Frank Byron Jevons in the role, Senior Proctor of the university from 1901, Professor in 1910 and Vice-Chancellor between 1926 and 1928.  He was awarded an OBE, as Honorary Secretary of the Preservation Fund, for his part in raising \u00a3120,000 to prevent Durham Castle from collapsing into the River Wear.\nHe devoted essentially his whole working life to the four colour theorem and related questions. In 1890 he exposed a flaw in Alfred Kempe's proof, that had been considered as valid for 11 years. The four colour theorem being open again, he established the five colour theorem instead. The four colour theorem itself was finally established by a computer-based proof in 1976.\nHeawood also studied colouring of maps on higher surfaces and established the upper bound on the chromatic number of such a graph in terms of the connectivity (genus, or number of handles) of the surface.  This upper bound was proved only in 1968 to be the actual maximum.\nWriting in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society, G. A. Dirac wrote:\n\nIn his appearance, manners and habits of thought, Heawood was an extravagantly unusual man. He had an immense moustache and a meagre, slightly stooping figure. He usually wore an Inverness cape of strange pattern and manifest antiquity, and carried an ancient handbag. His walk was delicate and hasty, and he was often accompanied by a dog, which was admitted to his lectures. ... His transparent sincerity, piety and goodness of heart, and his eccentricity and extraordinary blend of naivet\u00e9 and shrewdness secured for him not only the fascinated interest, but also the regard and respect of his colleagues.\nHe was fond of country pursuits, and one of his interests was Hebrew. His nickname was \"Pussy\". He was a cousin of the physicist Sir Oliver Lodge.\nDurham University awards an annual Heawood Prize to a student graduating in Mathematics whose performance is outstanding in the final year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newport, Shropshire", "response": ["* Percy John Heawood (1861 in Newport \u2013 1955) \u2013 British mathematician "]}, {"page": "Oliver Lodge", "response": ["* Percy John Heawood, mathematician (cousin)"]}, {"page": "Ipswich School", "response": ["*Percy John Heawood (1861\u20131955), mathematician and Vice-Chancellor of Durham University"]}, {"page": "Heawood graph", "response": ["In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Heawood graph is an undirected graph with 14 vertices and 21 edges, named after Percy John Heawood.", "The graph is named after Percy John Heawood, who in 1890 proved that in every subdivision of the torus into polygons, the polygonal regions can be colored by at most seven colors.

One case, the non-orientable Klein bottle, proved an exception to the general formula. An entirely different approach was needed for the much older problem of finding the number of colors needed for the plane or sphere, solved in 1976 as the four color theorem by Haken and Appel. On the sphere the lower bound is easy, whereas for higher genera the upper bound is easy and was proved in Heawood's original short paper that contained the conjecture. In other words, Ringel, Youngs and others had to construct extreme examples for every genus g = 1,2,3,.... If g = 12s + k, the genera fall into 12 cases according as k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.
