However, commentators quickly responded that his ideas are just a variation of the standard IEEE 754 concept of NaN (Not a Number), which has been commonly employed on computers in floating point arithmetic for many years.Dr Anderson defended against the criticism of his claims on BBC Berkshire on 12 December 2006, saying, \"If anyone doubts me I can hit them over the head with a computer that does it.\"Anderson was banned from teaching Transreal Arithmetic at the University of Reading in 2019 when he was reported to have been teaching it during a class \"Fundamentals of Computer Science\". Andersons nullity and transreal arithmetic are unaccepted by mathematicians and computer scientists alike, and is not a fundamental part of computer science.
