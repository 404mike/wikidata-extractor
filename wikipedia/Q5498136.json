His imprisonment produced a number of petitions in his support and an attempt in parliament to repeal the law on blasphemy. Gott was supported by a number of M.P.s. as well as the Conway Hall Ethical Society and many of its members and supporters like Frederick James Gould, William Thomas Stead, Chapman Cohen and George William Foote.  The proposed new legislation to replace the blasphemy law was supported by the Prime Minister H. H.

At 30, she was a founding member of the East London Ethical Society (launched in 1890), described as 'devoted and enthusiastic' by fellow worker Frederick James Gould in his Life-Story of a Humanist. From her earliest involvement with the Ethical Movement, Vallance spoke widely on its behalf, advocating the development of moral ideas and action distinct from theological or supernatural beliefs. A central principle of the movement was that 'the love of goodness and the love of one's fellows are the true motives for right conduct; and self-reliance and co-operation are the true sources of help.' Vallance herself wrote that 'Salvation consists in the surrender of the private for the public weal'."]}, {"page": "Constance E. Plumptre", "response": ["Described as a 'perceptive thinker and author', Plumptre wrote widely on philosophy and religion, 'deliberately seeking out and championing persecuted and obscure thinkers of the past such as Giordano Bruno and Lucilio Vanini.' Her General Sketch of the History of Pantheism, was initially published anonymously, only later reprinted using her name. It has been described as providing 'an erudite but accessible introduction to Oriental, Greek and modern Pantheism'. Of Vanini, and other freethinkers who suffered persecution for their unorthodoxy, she wrote:The wonder was, not that men like Servetus or Vanini should have momentarily yielded to the temptation of denial or equivocation, but that the love of knowledge should have been sufficiently strong to render them courageous enough to prosecute it at all.Her only work of fiction was a historical novel, Giordano Bruno (1884), about the Renaissance philosopher and mathematician burned for heresy in 1600. Frederick James Gould, in his Chats with Pioneers of Modern Thought, published in 1898, wrote of it that 'all the ascertained facts of his career are exposed with sufficient interweaving of fiction to render the story of his life eminently readable'."]}]}}
