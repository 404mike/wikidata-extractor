Dudeney introduced many new concepts to the puzzle world, including the first known crossnumber puzzle, in 1926. In that same year, Dudeney produced an article, \"The Psychology of Puzzle Crazes\", reflecting and analysing the demand for such works. He edited Perplexities from 1910 until he died in 1930. G. H. Savage became the column's editor, soon to be joined by William Thomas Williams (as W. T. Williams), who in 1935 authored the best-known cross-figure puzzle of today. The puzzle goes by many names, the original being \"The Little Pigley Farm\". It has also been known as \"Dog's Mead\", \"Little Pigley\", \"Little Piggly Farm\", \"Little Pigsby\", \"Pilgrims\u2019 Plot\", and \"Dog Days\"."]}, {"page": "Qualitative variation", "response": ["The Canberra distance is a weighted version of the L1 metric.

It included scholars among its members such as Dorothy L. Sayers and Dick Sheppard. The group was later dissolved due to World War II. The organisation was succeeded by the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, founded in 1951 by a group of five people who organised the Sherlock Holmes exhibition at the 1951 Festival of Britain, including Freda Howlett, who was at one time the last surviving founder; she remained a member until her death nearly seventy years later in 2020 and was once president of the society. One of the other founders was W. T. Williams, and among those present at the first meeting were Guy Warrack, Gerald Kelly, and Winifred Paget, daughter of Sidney Paget. The society's first president was Sydney Castle Roberts. In 1957, the society unveiled a commemorative plaque for Sherlock Holmes near the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, together with an American Sherlockian society, the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota. The London society also unveiled the world's first statue of Sherlock Holmes in Meiringen, Switzerland, near the Reichenbach Falls, in 1988. In 1999, the society's campaign for a Sherlock Holmes statue in London resulted in the unveiling of the statue of Sherlock Holmes in London. The society's events include discussions, lectures, film viewings, and Victorian cricket matches. The society also organises annual outings to areas related to Sherlock Holmes, typically to areas around the UK but also including \"pilgrimages\" to the Reichenbach Falls, such as the group's seventh pilgrimage to the Falls, which occurred in 2012. As of 2012, the society has nearly 1,200 full members and more than 200 associate members. Membership is open to anyone."]}, {"page": "Geoff Tracey", "response": ["The book followed on from Webb and Tracey's initial effort at overall classification of the Wet Tropics rainforest vegetation types in the set of  15 1:100,000 vegetation maps which they produced for publication by CSIRO in 1975. The maps had been produced to provide an ecological background for recent studies of the region by the authors and their collaborators, such as Jiro Kikkawa, W. T. Williams and M. B. Dale and were accompanied by a detailed explanatory key to the different vegetation types."]}]}}
