His assistant John Deehan was sacked after the final whistle and Harper said in the press conference after the game he was considering his own future due to Deehan's sacking. Due to a long-term back problem he was ruled out of action until he had treatment, which resulted in him signing goalkeeper Nathan Abbey in January 2010. He said he was unsure over his future at the club in April 2010 before being appointed full-time manager on 17 May, with Tommy Jaszczun returning to the club as his assistant manager.

His next 12 years with the Lincolnshire club were to prove the best of his footballing career. His first season with Boston was a disaster, with the club finishing bottom and being relegated from the Football Conference to the Northern Premier League. However, despite conceding 69 goals in 42 games, Bastock was still voted Player of the Season by supporters. He started to concede less goals the season after and Boston had a string of respectable league positions from 1993 to 1998 when they were moved to the Southern Premier League and their fortunes took an upturn. Bastock helped them to a second-place finish in the 1998\u201399 season and the team won the league and were promoted back to the Conference in 2000. He spent two seasons in the Conference before Boston were promoted to the Football League Third Division, Bastock missing just one game all season as Boston won the Conference. He won the Player of the Season award again in the 2002\u201303 season, ten years after last winning it. He remained first choice throughout the whole 2003\u201304 season; the highlight of which was saving a penalty from Yeovil's Gavin Williams to help his side to a 3\u20132 win. In the summer of 2004, Boston signed Nathan Abbey and Bastock was unable to regain his first-team place.
