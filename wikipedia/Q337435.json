He is a former World Outdoor and Indoor, European Outdoor and Indoor, and Commonwealth triple jump champion. He was also a silver medalist at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Idowu is a member of the London-based Belgrave Harriers athletics club and has been for much of his career.\nDespite his successes, Idowu has at times been accused of inconsistency and of failing to fulfil his potential, including his disappointing failure at the London Olympics 2012. His championship record since 2008, especially his gold medal at the 2009 World Athletics Championships, has addressed some of these criticisms; the Olympic Games is the only major championship to have eluded him, with a silver medal in 2008.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 30", "response": ["*  1978   \u2013 Phillips Idowu, English triple jumper"]}, {"page": "Phillips", "response": ["* Phillips Idowu (born 1978), British athlete"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump", "response": ["This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics.
