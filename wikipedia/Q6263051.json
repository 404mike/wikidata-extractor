In print, Roger Ascham in his Toxophilus (1545) refers to \"ye noble black prince Edward beside Poeters\"; while Richard Grafton, in his Chronicle at Large (1569), uses the name on three occasions, saying that \"some writers name him the black prince\", and elsewhere that he was \"commonly called the black Prince\". Raphael Holinshed uses it several times in his Chronicles (1577); and it is also used by William Shakespeare, in his plays Richard II (written c. 1595; Act 2, scene 3) and Henry V (c. 1599; Act 2, scene 4). In 1688 it appears prominently in the title of Joshua Barnes's The History of that Most Victorious Monarch, Edward IIId, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, and First Founder of the Most Noble Order of the Garter: Being a Full and Exact Account Of the Life and Death of the said King: Together with That of his Most Renowned Son, Edward, Prince of Wales and of Aquitain, Sirnamed the Black-Prince."]}, {"page": "Warkworth", "response": ["*John Warkworth"]}, {"page": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon", "response": ["Stafford repaid the king's generosity by serving him faithfully as a local commissioner, in a part of the country that had up until that point been fiercely Lancastrian. Throughout the 1460s he presided at Quarter Sessions and other courts all over the West Country. His activities were not limited to legal commissions; in 1461\u20132 he performed military service against the Scots, and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with Brittany. In 1469 he was admitted to the Royal Council, and served on the commission that convicted Henry Courtenay, Thomas Courtenay's brother, for treason. According to the chronicler John Warkworth, Henry's downfall was due to the machinations of Stafford, who was rewarded with further land and  created Earl of Devon on 17 May 1469. However, the king himself took great interest in the trial against Courtenay, and it is more reasonable to see the decision as a result of Edward's need for a loyal agent in the region.Ross (1997), p. 123."]}, {"page": "List of masters of Peterhouse, Cambridge", "response": ["| John Warkworth"]}, {"page": "Brut Chronicle", "response": ["Outside the traditional lay, upper-class audience, the reach of the Middle English translations of the Brut extended the audience to the merchant class.
