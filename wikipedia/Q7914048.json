It was designed as a double mill by the architect Sydney Stott. The first mill was built in 1904 and the second mill in 1915. In 1968, it was equipped  with the first open-end spinning machines in England. When spinning ceased in the 1990s, it was bought by Vance Miller. Trading Standards raided the mill in 2006, and ordered Mr Miller stop selling products that failed national safety provisions. Maple No.2 was mostly destroyed by fire in April 2009; the fire brigade was in attendance for two weeks and deployed 34 appliances. Maple No.1 was damaged by fire on 30 September 2016. On 15 December 2016 a major incident was declared when the same mill became fully ablaze.", "=== Vance Miller ownership ===", "It was bought by Vance Miller and used to manufacture and market fitted kitchens and furniture.", "In 2006 the Greater Manchester Police and Trading Standards raided the Maple Mill offices and factory of Vance Miller. As a result of the raids four people, including Miller, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud in what was one of Tradings Standards' biggest ever operations. The company was able to continue trading despite Trading Standards seizing property in a bid to pursue its case against the company.", "On 21 February 2007, under the General Product Safety Regulations Act 2005, Trading Standards Officers in Oldham  ordered Vance Miller, again trading from Maple Mill, to immediately withdraw four types of minibikes from sale. The products failed national safety provisions.", "On the morning of 15 December 2016 another fire started at the Maple No.1. The fire started on the top floor of the mill. Around 70 firefighters attended, with nearby properties evacuated. The building was declared to be structurally unstable as a result of the fire, during which large parts of the building collapsed, and work to demolish unsafe portions of the mill began on 16 December, expected to take three days. Although the mill was vacant, some people may have been sleeping inside it. People living in caravans had been seen at the site since September 2016, with Vance Miller saying that the fire would not have started if travellers had been evicted from the site. Fire crews left the mill on 24 December, nine days after the fire started; most of the mill was demolished, with only a tower remaining."]}]}}
