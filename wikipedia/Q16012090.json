However he did feature regularly in the 1956\u201357 season, during which he won the Scottish League Cup with the Hoops overcoming Partick Thistle in the final after a replay to win that competition for the first time. When Stein retired and took over the reserve team, Jack assisted until he departed in 1959, spending a short period with Morton.\nBorn Jonas Kaduskevieche, he was one of four Scots of Lithuanian descent to play for the club between the 1930s and 1960s, all of them defenders, the most famous being Billy McNeill who joined as a teenager in 1957 and quickly overtook Jack in the queue for team selection.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bellshill", "response": ["The first mine to open (and the last to close in 1953) was the Thankerton mine.
