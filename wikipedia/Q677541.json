In July 2013, the club won 2\u20130 away from home against \u00cdF Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated V\u00e5lerenga 4\u20131 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3\u20130 to go through to the next round 5\u20130 on aggregate. This was the club's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9\u20134 on aggregate in the first round of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition. They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1\u20130 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process \u2013 another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2\u20131 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule. The following season, Linfield's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 T\u00f3rshavn in the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney's first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2\u20131 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1\u20131 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1\u20130 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since their debut in 1959. However, the Blues fell to a 2\u20130 defeat in the away leg, which meant they were eliminated 2\u20131 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "Mulgrew", "response": ["*Jamie Mulgrew (born 1986), Northern Irish football player"]}, {"page": "2007 Setanta Sports Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||22 || Jamie Mulgrew || || "]}, {"page": "2008 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Jamie Mulgrew (Linfield)"]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["The Ulster Footballer of the Year is the older of two association football player of the year awards in Northern Ireland.
