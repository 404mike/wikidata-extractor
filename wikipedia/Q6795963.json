He also shared a mutual attraction with jazz singer Maxine Daniels, whom he met at the Empire Theatre. He made a pass at her, but she told him she was already happily married with a daughter."]}, {"page": "Stepney", "response": ["Others born in Stepney are entertainer Des O'Connor, actor Steven Berkoff, Steven Berkoff: The real East Enders, The Independent 4 January 2007 accessed 10 May 2007 playwright Arnold Wesker, gardener Rachel De Thame, television executive Alan Yentob, artist Frank Paton, drummer Kenney Jones, musician and writer Jah Wobble,Jah Wobble, Memoirs of a Geezer, p. 1. singer Kenny Lynch and his sister Maxine Daniels, singer Charles Coborn, footballers Ledley King, Ashley Cole, Mark Lazarus and Darren Purse, Heavyweight boxer \"Bombardier\" Billy Wells, former armed robber and businessman Roy Shaw, former British featherweight boxing champion Sammy McCarthy, sportswriter Norman Giller, and Labour politician Wes Streeting."]}, {"page": "Kenny Lynch", "response": ["Lynch grew up in Stepney, East London, as one of 13 children; his sister Gladys (stage name Maxine Daniels) was a jazz singer of some note.
