Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, \"Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie\" (\"The Secret of Vril Energy\"),. of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the \"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft\", which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym \"Johannes T\u00e4ufer\" (German: \"John [the] Baptist\"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was \"T\u00e4ufer\"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.. See image in German Wikipedia The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the \"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft\" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.Strube (2013), 126\u2013140. Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the \"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft,\" who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875\u20131947).Strube (2013), 98\u2013123.", "After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the Vienna Circle elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril theme in a new context.Goodrick-Clarke (2002). In their writings, Vril is associated with Nazi UFOs and the Black Sun concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the Tempelhofgesellschaft, has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as Iron Sky, Wolfenstein, and Call of Duty."]}, {"page": "James H.
