He was a historian and the first Librarian to be a member of the University Senate. The building of a new Arts Library meant that the stock had to be divided into two groups of subjects: arts and social sciences, and science and technology. The latter subjects remained in the original Christie Library though in areas of overlap there was some duplicating of entries in the library catalogues to assist the readers. By the early 1950s the stock had grown to such a size that the arts library building needed to be extended. This had been foreseen by the architects and once funds were available the building of two new wings in a similar style was undertaken between 1953 and 1957 (however the pattern of reading and stack rooms in the three wings is not the same). Features such as an exhibition hall and a department of special collections were included in the design together with improvements in the administrative accommodation. New departments had been established in the university by this time and these meant that the library extended its coverage in areas such as American studies, history of art, music and Near Eastern studies.", "Notable librarians of the library before 1972 were Charles W. E. Leigh (1903\u20131935), Moses Tyson (1935\u20131965) and Frederick William Ratcliffe (formerly assistant librarian, librarian 1965\u20131980) whose years of service amount to a total of 78 years. George Wilson was librarian of the Medical Library for over 50 years.", "* Pullan, Brian & Abendstern, Michele (2000) A History of the University of Manchester, 1951\u201373.
