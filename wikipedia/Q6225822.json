Cassell, 1931), P.25-26. However, General Charteris wasn't serving with II Corps in 1914, and was commenting on it therefore from a second-hand perspective, and an examination of his original war correspondence and notes from which his book's text was drawn makes no contemporary mention of the story at that time, and it would appear likely that he retrospectively added it into the book's narrative when writing it post-war, acknowledging in the book's preface that he had 'amplified' the original source material in parts in such a way to supplement the text.David Clarke, \u201cRumours of Angels: a response to Simpson\u201d, Folklore,  April 2004."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Charteris"]}, {"page": "Dumfriesshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Charteris"]}, {"page": "Battle of Neuve Chapelle", "response": ["The battle had no strategic effect but showed that the British were capable of mounting an organised attack, after several winter months of static warfare.
