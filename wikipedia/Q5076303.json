McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763\u20131820) who described the operation but never performed it.

Observations on the extraction of diseased Ovaria; illustrated by plates. Edinburgh: Daniel Lizars, 1825. Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801\u20131893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform. Keith performed his first ovariotomy in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells. From the outset he recorded his  results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower that of other published series like Spencer Wells"]}, {"page": "Charles Clay", "response": ["Charles Clay may refer to:", "* Charles Clay (American football) (born 1989), American football fullback and tight end", "* Charles Clay (surgeon) (1801\u20131893), English surgeon"]}]}}
