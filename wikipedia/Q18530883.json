They were also noted anthologists, assembled large collections of children's literature, toys, and games and were regarded as world-famous authorities on children's lore and customs.Their research had a considerable impact on a number of research fields, including Folklore and Childhood Studies and altered perceptions of children's street culture and notions of play, by emphasising the agency of children.Working outside of academia, the couple worked together closely, from their home (firstly near Farnham, Surrey, later in Alton, Hampshire) conducting primary fieldwork, library research, and interviews with thousands of children. In pursuing the folklore of contemporary childhood they directly recorded rhymes and games in real time as they were being sung, chanted, or played. They collaborated on several celebrated books and produced over 30 works.  \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1999 in literature", "response": ["*Iona Opie \u2013 Here Comes Mother Goose", "*Iona Opie \u2013 Here Comes Mother Goose"]}, {"page": "1996 in literature", "response": ["*Iona Opie \u2013 My Very First Mother Goose"]}, {"page": "Maurice Sendak", "response": ["* I Saw Esau (edited by Iona Opie and Peter Opie, 1992)"]}, {"page": "Georgie Porgie", "response": ["But by 1884 a version had appeared in which the third line read \"When the boys came out to play\",Nursery numbers, a new book of old rhymes, Marcus Ward & Co, 1884 p.35 and it was this reading which Peter and Iona Opie chose to perpetuate in their day in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951).

There is evidence that street games in many European and North American regions are disappearing as children play less in 'unsafe' traffic-filled roads, and simple games compete with the rise of television, video games and other pastimes; however, detailed observations indicate that they still thrive in the playground.E. Grugeon, \"What sort of texts are these?\", in E. Bearne and V. Watson, eds, Where Texts and Children Meet (London: Routledge, 2000), pp. 98-112.
