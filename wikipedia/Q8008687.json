An all-rounder, he played county cricket for Worcestershire and Hampshire, as well as representing the Gentlemen against the Players, but he appeared most for Oxford University, whom he represented on 31 occasions. It was said in Wisden in 1914 that he was \"one of the best all-round amateurs of his day,\" and that if he had played more regularly, it was \"quite likely\" he would have played for England.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
