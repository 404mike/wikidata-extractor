In the play-off eliminator, Hartlepool defeated Bromley 3\u20132, scoring three goals in seven first-half minutes before Bromley scored two in the second half, ultimately proving to not be enough.  In the semi-final, they travelled to Stockport County where Rhys Oates scored with fifteen minutes left to book Hartlepool's place in the final.  On 20 June 2021, Hartlepool faced Torquay United in the play-off final at Ashton Gate Stadium. After Luke Armstrong gave Hartlepool the lead in the first half, Torquay goalkeeper Lucas Covolan scored a last minute equaliser to take the match to extra-time.
