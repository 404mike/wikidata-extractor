Manager Don Mackay initially used Walker's funds to make signings which helped ensure Rovers survival that season, and built the platform for a promotion challenge in 1991\u201392. Walker declared his ambition early on that Rovers would return to the top flight, establish themselves as a top side in England and eventually go on to compete with the very best clubs in Europe. Kenny Dalglish became manager in October 1991, and by May, Rovers had been promoted to the newly formed Premier League through the play offs."]}, {"page": "Jason Beckford", "response": ["Beckford began his career at Manchester City in 1987\u201388, who were then a Second Division side under the stewardship of Mel Machin. City won promotion as the division's runners-up in 1988\u201389, and went on to finish 14th in the First Division in 1989\u201390 under new boss Howard Kendall. Towards the end of the 1990\u201391 season, new manager Peter Reid allowed Beckford to drop down a division to play four games on loan at Don Mackay's Blackburn Rovers. After returning from Ewood Park, he found himself out of the first team picture at Maine Road. John Rudge \u2013 who had sold his brother Darren a few months earlier \u2013 brought Beckford on loan to Port Vale in September as cover for the injured Keith Houchen. He claimed a goal in a 2\u20131 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 12 October, before leaving Vale Park after five Second Division appearances. He moved on to Birmingham City in the 1991\u201392 season for a \u00a3150,000 fee, but his Blues career was blighted with a serious knee injury for 20 months which kept him out of manager Terry Cooper's first team plans. He scored the \"Blues\" consolation goal on his debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to Stoke City at the Victoria Ground on 4 January, but started just two league games as Birmingham won promotion as runners-up of the Third Division. He started three games at the start of the 1992\u201393 campaign, and claimed a goal at St Andrew's in a 2\u20130 win over Southend United on 1 September. Beckford's only appearances in the 1993\u201394 season came at Gigg Lane in a three-game loan spell with Mike Walsh's Bury after coming back from long term injury at Birmingham. Beckford spent the first half of the 1994\u201395 season at Stoke City, but made just three starts for the \"Potters\". He then joined Mick McCarthy's Millwall, and played nine First Division games in the second half of the 1994\u201395 season. However, he left The Old Den at the end of the season, and arrived at Third Division side Northampton Town for the start of the 1995\u201396 campaign. He made four substitute appearances for Ian Atkins's \"Cobblers\", before announcing his retirement at Sixfields due to injury sustained in his spell at Birmingham City FC."]}]}}
