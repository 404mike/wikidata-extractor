His expert knowledge of early instruments and the interpretation of pre-classical music owed much to a period of study with Arnold Dolmetsch at Haslemere, Surrey.  He was appointed OBE in the 1979 Birthday Honours.\nHe was born in Leeds, and died in Firle, Sussex at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": {}}}
