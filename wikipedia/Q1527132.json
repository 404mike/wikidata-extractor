His expert knowledge of early instruments and the interpretation of pre-classical music owed much to a period of study with Arnold Dolmetsch at Haslemere, Surrey.  He was appointed OBE in the 1979 Birthday Honours.\nHe was born in Leeds, and died in Firle, Sussex at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Wagner", "response": ["The writer Robert Donington has produced a detailed, if controversial, Jungian interpretation of the Ring cycle, described as \"an approach to Wagner by way of his symbols\", which, for example, sees the character of the goddess Fricka as part of her husband Wotan's \"inner femininity\". Millington notes that Jean-Jacques Nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of Wagner's life and works."]}, {"page": "Der Ring des Nibelungen", "response": ["The Ring has been the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect Wagnerite, argues for a view of The Ring as an essentially socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses. Robert Donington in Wagner's Ring And Its Symbols interprets it in terms of Jungian psychology, as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind, leading towards individuation."]}, {"page": "Leitmotif", "response": ["The word gained currency with the overly literal interpretations of Wagner's music by Hans von Wolzogen, who in 1876 published a Leitfaden (guide or manual) to the Ring. In it he claimed to have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of \"Servitude\", the \"Spear\" or \"Treaty\" motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner's actual practice. Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published musical scores of the operas, arousing Wagner's annoyance; his wife Cosima Wagner quoted him as saying \"People will think all this nonsense is done at my request!\". In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, preferring to emphasize their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics Ernest Newman, Deryck Cooke and Robert Donington."]}, {"page": "Dynamics (music)", "response": ["The fact that the harpsichord could play only \"terraced\" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the \"somewhat misleading suggestion that baroque dynamics are 'terraced dynamics',\" writes Robert Donington.Donington, Robert: Baroque Music (1982) WW Norton, 1982. . Page 32. In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, Johann Joachim Quantz wrote that \"Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft.\"Donington, Robert: Baroque Music (1982) WW Norton, 1982. . Page 33. In addition to this, the harpsichord in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation."]}, {"page": "Anvil", "response": ["Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen is notable in using the anvil as pitched percussion. The vast majority of extant works use the anvil as unpitched. However tuned anvils are available as musical instruments, albeit unusual. These are not to be confused with the \"sawyers' anvils\" used to \"tune\" big circular saw blades. Steel anvils are used for tuning for use as musical instruments, because those based partly on cast iron and similar materials give a duller sound; this is actually valued in industry, as pure steel anvils are troublesomely noisy, though energetically more efficient. The hammer and anvil have enjoyed varying popularity in orchestral roles. Robert Donington pointed out that Sebastian Virdung notes them in his book of 1510, and Martin Agricola includes it in his list of instruments (Musica instrumentalis deudsch, 1529) largely as a compliment to Pythagoras. In pre-modern or modern times anvils occasionally appear in operatic works by Berlioz, Bizet, Gounod, Verdi, and Wagner for example. Commonly pairs of anvils tuned a third apart are used."]}, {"page": "L'Orfeo", "response": ["When Monteverdi composed L'Orfeo he had a thorough grounding in theatrical music. He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years, much of it as a performer or arranger of stage music, and in 1604 he had written the ballo Gli amori di Diane ed Endimone for the 1604\u201305 Mantua Carnival. The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score\u2014the aria, the strophic song, recitative, choruses, dances, dramatic musical interludes\u2014were, as conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt has pointed out, not created by him, but \"he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a unity that was indeed new\". Musicologist Robert Donington writes similarly: \"[The score] contains no element which was not based on precedent, but it reaches complete maturity in that recently developed form ... Here are words as directly expressed in music as [the pioneers of opera] wanted them expressed; here is music expressing them ... with the full inspiration of genius.\""]}, {"page": "Musica ficta", "response": ["* Lockwood, Lewis, Robert Donington, and Stanley Boorman. 1980. \"Musica Ficta\".

Writing in 1654, John Playford noted that the slide can be used in ascending (he called it \"elevation\") or in descending (he called it \"double backfall\") forms. Christopher Simpson described the figure in his Division Violist: \"Sometimes a note is graced by sliding to it from the third below, called an 'elevation', now something obsolete. Sometimes from the third above; which we call a double-backfall. This sliding a third, up, or down, is always done upon one string.\"Christopher Simpson, The Division Violist, or An Introduction to the Playing upon A Ground (London: William Godbid, 1659), p. 9. The example is taken from the second edition, 1665. Thomas Mace (1676) notes that the + sign above a note indicates its use."]}, {"page": "1979 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Robert Donington, Writer and Musician."]}, {"page": "Realization (figured bass)", "response": ["John Butt has argued that figured bass is an instance of \"purposely incomplete\" notation conferring a positive advantage. Accompaniments improvised from a figured bass line can be made to suit varying circumstances e.g. tempi, instrumentation, and even the hall acoustics.  Further, wrote Robert Donington: It was not from mere casualness that baroque composers preferred to trust their performers with figured bass ... It was from the high value they set on spontaneity. They believed, and modern experience confirms, that it is better to be accompanied with buoyancy than with polished workmanship. An accompanist who can give rhythmic impetus to his part, adapt it to the momentary requirements of balance and sonority, thicken it here and thin it there, and keep every bar alive, can stimulate his colleagues and help to carry the entire ensemble along. This is not merely to fill in the harmony; nor is it merely to make the harmony into an interesting part; it is to share in the creative urgency of the actual performance.
