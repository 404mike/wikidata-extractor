Smith encouraged Davison to pursue a career in medical illustration, recognising her artistic skill and commissioning her to produce anatomical drawings for him. Her first assignment was to illustrate a reptilian brain from over 50 histological sections. She subsequently worked with anatomist Sir John Stopford, and later with Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. Davison worked across a number of different specialities, and with a range of practitioners. She produced illustrations for orthopaedic surgeon Sir Harry Platt, Professor of Anatomy G.A.G Mitchell, and obstetrician Daniel Dougal. She worked particularly closely with Jefferson, a neurosurgeon, and always emphasised the importance of collaboration between artist and practitioner. Davison also produced illustrations for notable publications, including Mitchell\u2019s Anatomy of the Autonomous Nervous System and Israel\u2019s Atlas of Pathological Haematology. Davison would sketch in the operating theatre, and tidy up her illustrations later. "]}]}}
