Stamos was initially set to play Dr. Frank N. Furter, but the role was recast due to network resistance. Costumes used in the episode were inspired by the Rocky Horror musical and film, but were adapted for the Glee cast and cost over $30,000. The tight gold lam\u00e9 underwear worn by Peter Hinwood in the 1975 film were replaced by board shorts for Overstreet. In dressing Riley as Frank, series costume designer Lou Eyrich found it challenging to select outfits which would be acceptable for a primetime series, yet would still appeal to all audiences. To appeal to younger viewers, Eyrich updated the costume worn by Colfer as Riff Raff, pairing a tailcoat with jeans and a J.Crew henley shirt. Michele's costuming as Janet was similar to her regular wardrobe as Rachel, with Eyrich commenting, \"That's why she was the perfect Janet.\" Prior to broadcast, cast member Mark Salling claimed that he would play Rocky Horror talking lips. In the event, however, Salling did not appear in the episode. He was temporarily absent from the series, reportedly for creative reasons, and returned in November 2010. The lips were instead played by Rivera."]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 1975", "response": ["| ||  || United KingdomUnited States || Comedy, horror, musical, science fiction|| Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell (credited as Little Nell), Jonathan Adams, Peter Hinwood, Meat Loaf, Charles Gray, Jeremy Newson and Hilary Farr ||"]}, {"page": "Christopher Gibbs", "response": ["His \"life and business partner\" was Peter Hinwood, the actor turned antique dealer and designer."]}, {"page": "Trevor White (musician)", "response": ["In the 1975 musical comedy The Rocky Horror Picture Show, White dubbed the singing voice of Rocky, who was played by Peter Hinwood."]}, {"page": "Hinwood, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Hinwood"]}]}}
