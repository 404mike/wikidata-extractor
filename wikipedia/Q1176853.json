In the 2014 BBC audiobook dramatisations of the books, he is portrayed by Marco Williamson. Will Poulter plays Eustace in the Walden Media film adaptation, directed by Michael Apted. Among the alterations for the film is that when Eustace is turned into a dragon, he proves his true identity to Edmund by flying him to where he has used his fire breath to carve the sentence, \"I am Eustace\" on the ground.  Once establishing his identity, the agonizingly undersized bracelet Eustace was wearing when he was transformed into a dragon is quickly removed with Lucy's help (In the book, Lucy eased the pain with her cordial but the arm bracelet was not removed until Eustace resumed human form.).  Afterward and still in his dragon form Eustace accompanies the Dawn Treader on its quest to the next islands and earns the respect of the crew first by towing the ship when it is caught in magically imposed doldrums and later aiding the crew in battle against the sea serpent on the Dark Island, but gets injured. It is here that Aslan restores Eustace to normal, but only by scratching off the dragon's skin. Eustace's final redemption comes when he races to lay the seventh magic sword at Aslan's Table, unleashing the swords' power to defeat the evil of Dark Island and saving his friends."]}, {"page": "The Chronicles of Narnia (TV series)", "response": ["*David Thwaites as Eustace", "*David Thwaites as Eustace Clarence Scrubb"]}, {"page": "Thwaites", "response": ["*David Thwaites (born 1976), British actor"]}, {"page": "List of actors who have played Narnia characters", "response": ["|David Thwaites"]}, {"page": "The Silver Chair (1990 TV serial)", "response": ["*David Thwaites as Eustace Clarence Scrubb"]}, {"page": "List of dragons in film and television", "response": ["| Eustace Scrubb || The Chronicles of Narnia || 1989 || European || Human || David Thwaites || The Voyage of the Dawn Treader || Eustace later references his transformation in the final episode of the serial, The Silver Chair, when his party encounters a dragon."]}, {"page": "Prince Caspian/The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1989 TV serial)", "response": ["*David Thwaites as Eustace Scrubb"]}, {"page": "What to Expect When You're Expecting (film)", "response": ["Written by Heidi Murkoff, What to Expect When You're Expecting is a pregnancy guide released in 1984.
