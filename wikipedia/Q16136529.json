He has also worked as a consultant and expert witness in matters relating to concrete, including a report for Lloyds insurers on whether the design of the World Trade Center towers had contributed to their collapse on 9/11: he concluded that \"the way they were designed and built actually prevented them from falling over and thus would have saved around 100,000 lives which would have been directly in their paths had they fallen over.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Penshaw Monument", "response": ["In 1982 a grant from the Countryside Commission allowed the National Trust to purchase  of land surrounding the monument, including much of the south-facing side of Penshaw Hill and the woodland to the north-west. The monument has been illuminated at night by floodlights since 1988, when Sunderland City Council paid \u00a350,000 () for them. Between 1994 and 1996, several of these lights were stolen; Northumbria Police said they may have been used as grow lights for the cultivation of cannabis. In 1994, The Journal reported that Penshaw Monument \"might be sinking\" after two surveys showed the levels of the bottoms of the columns were not even. The National Trust hired the civil engineer Professor John Knapton to carry out a third, more comprehensive survey of the monument to assess whether movement had occurred."]}, {"page": "MAX Green Line", "response": ["TriMet awarded the transit mall reconstruction contract to a joint venture between Stacy and Witbeck and Kiewit Pacific. Preparation work began with the rerouting of 17 bus lines to 3rd and 4th avenues, six lines to Southwest Columbia and Jefferson streets, and one line, the 14\u2013Hawthorne, to Southwest 2nd Avenue. Construction commenced on January 14, 2007, with the corridor's temporary closure. Owing to techniques learned from the Interstate MAX project, businesses were kept open while blocks were closed off from north to south in three- to four-block sections. The original transit mall had been built with mortar-set bricks, which proved difficult to maintain. TriMet experimented with sand-set brick paving during the reconstruction as recommended by British civil engineer John Knapton, who studied Roman road building methods. Tracks were laid  into the surface street while water pipes and sewers were buried  to  underground. Crews installed the last section of rail in May 2008. From June through August that year, workers closed the upper deck of the Steel Bridge to connect the existing Eastside MAX tracks with the new transit mall tracks."]}, {"page": "Wade's Causeway", "response": ["Johnston, historian Nikolaus Pevsner and landscape historian Richard Muir all agree that an original gravel surface dressing was once present on top of the stone of the Wheeldale structure. Whereas Johnston and Pevsner believe that the gravel was washed away through weathering, Muir states that human agents were primarily responsible for its removal. Both agree that the stonework remaining does not represent the original road surface. Statements by the eighteenth-century antiquary Francis Drake and nineteenth-century topographer Samuel Lewis that the writers found it to be \"paved with a flint pebble\" may support this theory, although Hayes and Rutter cast doubt on the accuracy of Drake's reports. Codrington states that in 1817 the causeway consisted of a \"strong pavement of stones\u00a0... [with] above these another stratum of gravel\u00a0...\", Hayes and Rutter state that \"traces of a surface layer of gravel and small stones\" remained visible in the 1960s, and professor of structural engineering John Knapton states that there remained some evidence of smaller surface-dressing pebbles as late as 1996."]}, {"page": "John Knapton", "response": ["John Knapton may refer to:", "* John Knapton (engineer)", "* John Knapton (MP)"]}]}}
