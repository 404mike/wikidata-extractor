Steele's rise to fame was dramatised in The Tommy Steele Story (1957), the soundtrack of which was the first British album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. He starred in further musical films including The Duke Wore Jeans (1958) and Tommy the Toreador (1959), the latter spawning the hit \"Little White Bull\". \nBy the 1960s, Steele was an all-round entertainer, appearing in West End theatre productions and starring in musical films including Half a Sixpence (1967), The Happiest Millionaire (1967) and Finian's Rainbow (1968).
