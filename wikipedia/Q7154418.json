He played for Scotland that season, making him the only non-white player to represent the full Scotland team in the 20th century, and the first footballer with Asian origins to represent any of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland at senior level.\nFollowing his mother's death, his enthusiasm for football diminished.

Celtic won a league and cup double in 1973\u201374 and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. The ties against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were acrimonious, and Dalglish described the first leg in Glasgow where the Spanish side had three players sent off as \"without doubt the worst game I have ever played in as far as violence is concerned.\" Dalglish won a further Scottish Cup winner's medal in 1975, providing the cross for Paul Wilson's opening goal in a 3\u20131 win over Airdrieonians in what transpired to be captain Billy McNeill's last match before retiring from playing football."]}, {"page": "November 23", "response": ["*  1950   \u2013 Paul Wilson, Scottish footballer (d. 2017)Paul Wilson, MotherWELLnet"]}, {"page": "Scottish Junior Football Association", "response": ["The one exception noted on the list is Paul Wilson.

After Ronnie Simpson and his deputy John Fallon left the club, Evan Williams, Ally Hunter and Denis Connaghan all had spells as goalkeeper. Aberdeen got within two points of Celtic in 1970\u201371, with Rangers 15 behind in fourth. Aberdeen had an opportunity to take the title when they and Celtic met at Pittodrie in April 1971 but Celtic came away with a 1\u20131 draw,Steve Murray: Aberdeen should have ended Celtic\u2019s first run to nine-in-a-row as we were \u201cbest team\u201d in 1970/71, Sean Wallace, Evening Express, 8 June 2020 and although they dropped another point in the next fixture (coinciding with Aberdeen's last), they had two postponed matches to play and won them both to retain the championship. In 1971\u201372 the gap was 10 points, again ahead of Aberdeen (Rangers 16 off Celtic's total), as the Hoops also reached another European Cup semi-final, losing to Inter on a penalty shootout. The early 1970s had been a turbulent period for Rangers, as they not only had to contend with a powerful Celtic but also with the traumatic events of another disaster at Ibrox in January 1971 when 66 supporters died in a crush on a stairway at the end of an Old Firm fixture. This led the club to overhaul the ground into an all-seater stadium over the next decade, overseen by manager Willie Waddell (a 1950s Rangers hero as a player and the boss who led Kilmarnock to the 1965 title), though the financial impact of this undertaking was not obviously felt in the short term. On the field, the struggle to overcome Celtic's domestic run was offset by a victory in the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, confirming that Scottish teams still maintained high standards comparable to others across the continent despite the domestic dominance of one team alone.The forgotten story of \u2026 Rangers\u2019 1972 European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup win, Daniel Harris, The Guardian, 4 September 2014"]}]}}
