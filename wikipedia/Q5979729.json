Prior to joining the University of Kent, he was a professor of criminology at London South Bank University and Middlesex University.\nMatthews is known as one of the key figures in left realism, a criminological critique of both the dominant administrative criminology and the critical criminology (\"left idealism\").\nHe died on 7 April 2020 at the age of 71 from the effects of the COVID-19 virus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Child prostitution", "response": ["Investigative journalist Julian Sher states that widespread stereotypes about the prostitution of children continued into the 1990s, when the first organized opposition arose and police officers began working to dispel common misconceptions. Criminologist Roger Matthews writes that concerns over pedophilia and child sexual abuse, as well as shifting perceptions of youth, led the public to see a sharp difference between prostitution of children and adult prostitution. While the latter is generally frowned upon, the former is seen as intolerable. Additionally, he states, children are increasingly viewed as \"innocent\" and \"pure\" and their prostitution as paramount to slavery. Through the shift in attitude, the public began to see minors involved in the sex trade as victims rather than as perpetrators of a crime, needing rehabilitation rather than punishment."]}, {"page": "Left realism", "response": ["Left Realism set down a marker in the United Kingdom with the work of Lea and Young (1984)Hopkins Burke, R.

With his colleagues, most notably John Lea and Roger Matthews, he developed left realist criminology in a series of books including What Is to Be Done About Law and Order? (1984).  He completed research on criminal victimisation, stop and search, and urban riots, and was a frequent contributor to media debates on crime and policing.  He was lead investigator in the Gifford Inquiry of 1985 following the Broadwater Farm riot. The Centre for Criminology was particularly known for left realist criminology and its series of local crime victimisation surveys, for example, the Islington Crime Surveys which were conducted in 1986 and 1990.  In 1998 he was awarded the Sellin-Glueck Award for Distinguished International Scholar by the American Society of Criminology followed in 2003 by the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Critical Criminology Division."]}, {"page": "Roger Matthews", "response": ["Roger Matthews may refer to:", "* Roger Matthews (criminologist) (born 1948), British criminologist", "* Roger Matthews (archaeologist) (born 1954), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Valeria Vegh Weis", "response": ["* Vegh Weis, Valeria (2017).
