Wigan earned the early advantage with the former St Helens player, Gleeson, scoring the game's opening try after three minutes following an Iosia Soliola knock-on. Deacon continued to put St Helens under pressure with threatening kicks to Richards, but it was Gleeson who scored his and Wigan's second try thanks to a move that started in the Warriors' half with Sam Tomkins and Deacon. Another Deacon kick was not properly controlled by St Helens, and Goulding touched down an easy try in the sixteenth minute. Richards scored his second goal with the conversion attempt, but did not last the first half as he suffered an injury to his Achilles tendon which ended his participation in the final. After coming close to a try through Matty Smith, St Helens eventually replied through Andrew Dixon to reduce the margin to ten points at half-time."]}, {"page": "2010 Super League Grand Final", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Andrew Dixon", "In the fourth minute Wigan were twelve metres out from St Helens' try-line when, on the fifth tackle, they passed it through the hands out to the right side where centre Martin Gleeson forced his way through the defence.  The video referee awarded the try and Pat Richards' conversion attempt missed so the Cherry & Whites were in front 4-0. At the fifteen-minute mark Wigan were working the ball out of their own half when they again moved the ball out to the right where Sam Tomkins made a break and then passed back inside to Thomas Leuluai in support. Leuluai then passed to Deacon who passed for Gleeson to cross untouched, putting the ball down behind the uprights for his second try.  Richards kicked the simple conversion so Wigan were in front 10-0. About three minutes later Wigan had again made their way up to within spitting distance of St Helens' try line where they passed the ball quickly out to right winger Darrell Goulding to dive over in the corner untouched.  Richards' sideline conversion was successful so The Warriors now led 16-0 with little over a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-eighth minute St Helens had managed to make their way up inside Wigan's ten-metre line where Jon Wilkin got the ball and ran back inside across the defensive line, passing to Andrew Dixon who ran untouched through a gap for a close-range try. The simple conversion was kicked by Jamie Foster so St Helens were trailing 16-6. No more points were scored in the remaining minutes so this was the half-time score."]}, {"page": "2011 Super League Grand Final", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Andrew Dixon"]}, {"page": "Andrew Dixon", "response": ["Andrew Dixon may refer to:", "* Andrew Dixon (As the World Turns), a character on the American soap opera As the World Turns", "* Andrew Dixon (investor) (born 1968), British investor", "* Andrew Dixon (rugby league) (born 1990), English rugby league player"]}, {"page": "2014 Salford Red Devils season", "response": ["|16|| Andrew Dixon ||SR ||B", "|16|| Andrew Dixon ||B ||12px ||L ||12px ||SR ||SR ||SR ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||SR ||SR ||SR ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x", "|16|| Andrew Dixon ||x ||x", "|Andrew Dixon"]}, {"page": "2015 Salford Red Devils season", "response": ["|23|| Andrew Dixon ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x", "|23|| Andrew Dixon ||x ", "|Andrew Dixon", "|Andrew Dixon"]}]}}
