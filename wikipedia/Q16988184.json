The album was written by Newton and on the recording she performs vocals and plays harp and viola. It also features Corrina Hewat on vocals and harp, Lauren MacColl on fiddle, Adam Holmes on vocals, Mattie Foulds on percussion, Su-a Lee on cello and musical saw and Alec Frank-Gemmill on horn. The theme was inspired by Scottish folk takes of human children being taken by fairies and replaced by supernatural creatures and the use of this to explain children with behavioural problems and disabilities. In the album Newton wanted to look at the darker side of traditional folk tales and use them to explore feelings about life and death that are hard to express outside of music. Robin Denselow writing in The Guardian gave it 3 stars out of 5 while praising the \"haunting vocal work and elegant harp playing\" and the Financial Times gave it 4 stars out of 5. Other reviews called it \"quietly compelling\" and \"emotionally stirring\"."]}]}}
