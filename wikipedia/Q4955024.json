He was sold on to Maidstone United for \u00a310,000 in February 1991, before he was allowed to join Port Vale on a free transfer in July 1992.

His assistant Clive Walker (not to be confused with the former Chelsea player) took over, and managed to keep the Stones off the foot of the table. Walker's managerial skills, combined with the efforts of the few capable players left at the club (notably a young Gary Breen, goalkeeper Iain Hesford, defender Bradley Sandeman and winger Liburd Henry) saw them through, although debts remained huge and the threat of being forced out of the Football League remained."]}, {"page": "Sandeman", "response": ["*Bradley Sandeman (born 1970), former English footballer"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Vale tour the Netherlands and participate in a TNT Tournament.
