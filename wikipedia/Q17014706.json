Over his lifetime he built up a substantial collection of books (16,000 volumes at the time of his death) and literary ephemera amongst which were materials by and about R. M. Ballantyne, the Victorian adventure story writer. Quayle's own work was mainly related to the themes of collecting books but he also produced a noted biography of Ballantyne (1967) and two books of folk tales: one of Cornish tales (The Magic Ointment) and one of Japanese tales (The Shining Princess). These were both illustrated by the prolific Michael Foreman.Quinton Quayle, the retired British diplomat, is one of Eric's children as is Chrissy Quayle, the musician (The Mermaid of Zennor).Quayle died in a fall from the cliffs at Zennor Head near to his home, Carn Cobba, a house noted for its cliffside gardens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Coral Island", "response": ["Ballantyne never visited the coral islands of the South Pacific, relying instead on the accounts of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including \"plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership\". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in a house on the Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams's Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams's book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as \"a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific\", adding that \"by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling\"."]}, {"page": "Ballantyne the Brave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eric Quayle"]}, {"page": "The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale", "response": ["This work of juvenile adventure fiction, also known as a Robinsonade, is a fantastic take on the foreign cities of Africa by one of children's literature's best novelists of the 19th century. Ballantyne puts great effort into making the entire story exotic and exciting.  The description he puts forth of both characters' dress and the living accoutrements portrays a rich city built on the backs of slaves. Eric Quayle, author of \"Ballantyne the Brave\", states that Ballantyne's work \"could be relied upon to stir romance and danger into humdrum affairs of everyday life and whose stories never failed to tingle with the steel of dramatic suspense and the bloodthirsty incidents so beloved by boys of all ages\".Quayle, Eric (1967). \"Ballantyne the Brave\", pg. 266, Western Printing Services, Ltd, Bristol. The males are different variations of acceptable masculinity in 19th-century Britain, they are \"hero[s] [with] God, certainty, the power of the knowledge of right, and English Imperialism as unquestionable guides\" in their adventure.Webb, Jean. \"Walking into the Sky: Englishness, Heroism, and Cultural Identity: A Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Perspective\".

Ballantyne is always careful to refrain from the sexes showing anything other than platonic interests in one another.  His strict Presbyterianism made him embarrassed to mention sex at all.  Even Ballantyne's bad guys \"never permitted themselves to be anything but perfect gentlemen in their encounters with [females]\".Quayle, Eric (1967). \"Ballantyne the Brave\", pg. 131, Western Printing Services, Ltd, Bristol."]}, {"page": "Quayle, Eric", "response": ["#redirectEric Quayle"]}]}}
