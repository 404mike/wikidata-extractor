Over his lifetime he built up a substantial collection of books (16,000 volumes at the time of his death) and literary ephemera amongst which were materials by and about R. M. Ballantyne, the Victorian adventure story writer. Quayle's own work was mainly related to the themes of collecting books but he also produced a noted biography of Ballantyne (1967) and two books of folk tales: one of Cornish tales (The Magic Ointment) and one of Japanese tales (The Shining Princess). These were both illustrated by the prolific Michael Foreman.Quinton Quayle, the retired British diplomat, is one of Eric's children as is Chrissy Quayle, the musician (The Mermaid of Zennor).Quayle died in a fall from the cliffs at Zennor Head near to his home, Carn Cobba, a house noted for its cliffside gardens.", "link_mentions": {}}}
