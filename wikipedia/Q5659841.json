From the early days, his methods are based on care of the body, power training and monitoring the heart rate - using them well in advance of their widespread use. He was the Great Britain team masseur on events including the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, seven world cycling championships, 21 Tours of Britain, three Peace Races (Warsaw-Berlin-Prague) and two Tours of Bohemia. He helped teams during 41 Manx Weeks and 34 Girvan Internationals. Riders he coached in the 1960s included time trialists Keith Stacey (British Best All-Rounder 1965) and Eric Matthews (24-hour champion 1968)[1]. In the 1980s he worked with Alan Geldard to help road riders turn to team pursuit.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, he coached a number of international road riders, including Alan Kemp, Ian Binder, Brian Pownall, Mike Williams, and Phil Roberts; international riders who were also national champions included multi-national hillclimb champion, Jeff Williams, national road race champions John Herety and Paul Sherwen and national motor-paced champion Ian Donohue. More recently he helped Hamish Haynes (British National Road Race Champion 2006): he joined the training programme as a third-category rider and under Nelson's guidance he became an elite rider within two years before turning professional for a Belgian team. [2]\nA number of past riders have moved on to other roles within the sport: four have been GB team masseurs for major events including the World Championships and the Olympic Games. One rider, Dan Guillemette has moved from the parallel route of Nelson's tutelage and qualifying and working physiotherapist to working with the professional racing team, Team Sky. Rob Palmer, another former rider, has worked as a chiropractor with a number of professional teams including Garmin and Cannondale. Also, a former rider, Brian Cookson, having been the President of British Cycling (1997-2013), since September 2013 has been the President of the Union Cycliste Internationale.\nNelson's Wythenshawe home was, for decades, the nightly venue for riders, be they juvenile riders or experienced seniors, male or female, national champions or those seeking to optimise more modest performances. Whereas the indoor training used to be based on the use of overload training on rollers, with the advent of the digital age, he moved to a virtual reality system which was popular with riders and helped a more efficient monitoring of performance and riding style. He used a wide network of expertise, academic and medical, garnered largely from his former riders, to help his current crop of riders.In 1987 Nelson was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to cycling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Herety", "response": ["Born in Cheadle, Cheshire (now in Greater Manchester), England, Herety joined Cheshire Road Club as a young teenager. His first win was in a Scouts' cyclo-cross race in Woodbank Park, Stockport. He was coached by Harold \"H\" Nelson and trained regularly with other local riders destined for professional careers, notably Graham Jones, Paul Sherwen and Ian Binder. Further success followed as a junior. He was known as a sprinter but he also won after breaking clear of the main field."]}, {"page": "Harold Nelson", "response": ["*Harold \"H\" Nelson (1928\u20132016), English cycling coach"]}, {"page": "Graham Jones (cyclist)", "response": ["Graham was born in Cheadle, just south of Manchester. As a youth he was on the books of Manchester United F.C. as a part of their youth program.Miroir du cyclisme, Mai 1979 Graham gave up football in favour of cycling. He took his first step towards becoming a professional cyclist in 1972, age 14 he joined the Abbotsford Park Road cycling club which then had a clubroom in Fallowfield, Manchester. During his first year of racing he had no success and was even lapped frequently during the circuit races. It was not until 1974 at 16 years of age he won his first race in Macclesfield. He was coached by Malcolm Firth, who, along with Harold \"H\" Nelson, developed a training routine based on heart rates and power training. In 1975, as a Junior, he gained three fourth places in national championships (pursuit, road race and 25-mile time-trial) \u2013 indeed, the 40\u00a0km/25-mile time trial was his first race over the distance for two years and covered the distance in a little over 57 minutes. As well as winning the divisional junior road title, he won the senior pursuit title against the established senior rider, Malcolm Fraser. In his last year as a junior he had 12 wins and also finished 22nd in the World Junior Road Race Championship. In 1976 he went to the Netherlands for five months: his best place was 2nd and he had a host of top six places.'1978 Cycling Yearbook', Roger St Pierre, 1978, Studio Publications, p127"]}]}}
