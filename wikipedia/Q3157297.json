The match lasted a considerable 35 short rounds taking forty minutes.  The dispute involved Aby's brother Isaac, known as Izzy, also a boxer.  Though the fighting continued for a while, Hudson injured his shoulder and both adversaries eventually ceased their hostilities.  Belasco twice waited over a minute  while his opponent's shoulder was reduced or relocated in its joint by his second so Hudson could continue the match.  In the opinion of Puglistica, Belasco definitely had the better of the fight, but it was ill-advised as Hudson was somewhat inebriated when the fighting began, and may have never chosen to fight if he had been sober.  Jack Randall, known as the \"Master of the Rolls\", and likely the best known English boxer of the period was a second to Belasco, and a significant crowd was likely in attendance.", "He fought Irish boxer Pat Halton, a taller man at 5' 11\" around 11 stone or 154 lbs.

In the eleventh round, a dispute occurred as to the matter of a foul, when while falling, Belasco accidentally touched his knee to Halton when Halton was down.  As a result, Halton's second, the boxer Jack Randall also noted the foul and took Halton out of the ring. The fighters had fought a total of twenty-seven minutes when the foul occurred.  When Halton failed to resume the match, the fight was called in favor of Belasco, though fighting and disorder followed.  Miles of Puglistica wrote that Belasco had clearly won by the tenth round, and the referees decided to call the match in his favor.", "| *Jack Randall"]}]}}
