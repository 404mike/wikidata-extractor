Within a fortnight of Bruford's arrival in the band, he had been replaced by Roger Earl (Bruford went on to huge success later as Yes's drummer). This line-up recorded two albums in 1968, Getting to the Point, and Blue Matter, which demonstrated Youlden's rise as a songwriter alongside Simmonds. It was this line-up that released the single \"Train to Nowhere\" in 1969. A Step Further was released later that year, and introduced bassist Tony Stevens replacing Jobe. They developed a loyal core following in the United States, due to songs such as \"I'm Tired,\" a driving, melodic song from the album."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Rivers Jobe (1950\u20131979), bass guitarist and member of Anon"]}, {"page": "Private Parts & Pieces", "response": ["The songs on Private Parts & Pieces were recorded between 1972 and 1976 at Send Barns, a recording facility set-up at the home of Phillips's parents in Woking, Surrey.

The earliest pieces were put down on a Revox 2-track tape machine before Phillips installed a TEAC 4-track with added Dolby noise reduction. The 12-string guitar played on the album was built by Rivers Jobe, one of Phillips's former school bandmates in Anon. In a 2014 interview, Phillips revealed that a radio broadcast can be heard in the background in the opening of one of the album's tracks.
