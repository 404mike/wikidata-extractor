His standing in the profession was largely the result of his textbooks of ophthalmology which were widely used in his home country and abroad.  His working career was spent at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and when he retired from clinical practice in 1905 he became involved in medical and national politics. He was surgeon-oculist in Scotland to King George V and then to King Edward VII and was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1910 to 1912. He was knighted in  1916. At the 1922 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament  for the Combined Scottish Universities , sitting as a Scottish Unionist. He held the seat until he stood down at the 1931 general election.", "link_mentions": {}}}
