His standing in the profession was largely the result of his textbooks of ophthalmology which were widely used in his home country and abroad.  His working career was spent at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and when he retired from clinical practice in 1905 he became involved in medical and national politics. He was surgeon-oculist in Scotland to King George V and then to King Edward VII and was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1910 to 1912. He was knighted in  1916. At the 1922 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament  for the Combined Scottish Universities , sitting as a Scottish Unionist. He held the seat until he stood down at the 1931 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Ian Scott", "response": ["He chose to specialise in ophthalmology and trained at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) under Harry M. Traquair, one of the pioneers of the scientific and clinical  study of the visual fields. Scott joined   the succession of ophthalmic surgeons in Edinburgh who promoted the study of the visual pathway and the quantitative measurement of fields of vision. This had begun with  George Andreas Berry, who trained under Jannik Bjerrum in Copenhagen in the 1880s, and continued through Arthur H H Sinclair and Traquair. In the course of his own training, Scott witnessed the Danish ophthalmologist Henning R\u00f8nne testing visual fields in the Copenhagen Rigshospitalet using the same matt black deeply-panelled double door which Bjerrum himself had used. In this work on perimetry, he provided valuable assistance to Norman M Dott, then pioneering neurosurgery in Edinburgh. He was elected  to Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) in 1937.", "In 1954 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). His proposers were Sir Robert Muir, Sir James Learmonth, Arthur H. H. Sinclair and Alexander Murray Drennan. He was elected Vice President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and when the president J J Mason-Brown died in office, Scott assumed the presidency in 1964, becoming the fifth ophthalmologist to hold that office. The four earlier ophthalmologist presidents were Douglas Argyll Robertson, George Andreas Berry, A H H Sinclair and Harry Moss Traquair. Scott also served as President of the Faculty of Ophthalmologists of the Royal Society of Medicine.  He became  President of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1972. In 1968 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Frederick Chavasse", "response": ["Chavasse was born in Wylde Green, Warwickshire, the sixth son of Thomas Chavasse (1800\u20131884), a surgeon with a practice in Birmingham and then in rural Warwickshire.\u00a0 Thomas the son began to study medicine at Queen's College, Birmingham with clinical teaching at Birmingham General Hospital. He then enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Here his teachers included Joseph Lister from whom he learned at first hand the value of antiseptic techniques in surgery.\u00a0He graduated MB CM in 1876. After graduation he spent six months in Vienna attending the clinic of Theodore Billroth, who, at that time, was pioneering the surgery of the abdomen.\u00a0 Billroth's clinic attracted young surgeons from all over Europe and amongst Chavasse's fellow postgraduate students was an Edinburgh contemporary Dr (later Sir) George Andreas Berry. From Vienna he continued his studies at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin under Bernhard von Langenbeck the surgeon credited with establishing scientific surgery in Germany. On return to Edinburgh he was house surgeon to Professor James Spence in the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Spence was resolutely opposed to the practice of antiseptic surgery, which meant that\u00a0 Chavasse had to be diplomatic about his enthusiasm for Listerian antisepsis. He furthered his knowledge of antisepsis, without offending his chief, by regularly attending Lister's Sunday afternoon clinic. In 1878 he obtained the higher degree of MD and passed the examinations to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd)."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1916", "response": ["|Maj.
