After the match, he issued an apology on behalf of the players, saying: \"We know we let ourselves and the fans down. We felt the same as everyone else connected with the club and know the performance was unacceptable. The support we had at Luton was fantastic and we didn't repay them how we wanted. Most were still there at the end of the game when our performance didn't merit that. As a group, we want to apologise and give fans their money back.\" In a follow\u2013up match against Accrington Stanley, Bailey made amends for the club's performances and set up a goal for Olufela Olomola, who scored twice, in a 3\u20132 win. It wasn't until on 26 September 2017 when he scored his first goal for Yeovil Town, in a 3\u20132 win against Chesterfield. Since making his debut for the club, Bailey quickly became a first team regular for Yeovil Town, playing in the midfield position.

The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup.

On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches.", "|Olufela Olomola|| v Stevenage, 28 October||Violent conduct||3 matches||Southend United (H), FA Cup; Carlisle United (A), Swindon Town (H), League Two"]}]}}
