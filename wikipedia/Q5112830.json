An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\".  The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978\u201381 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \"Simon Crisp\", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.
