After dropping out of school early, he went to work for a publisher before using family contacts to secure a job with organ builder Ivor of Hill, Norman & Beard in the 1930s. Mander started working independently in 1936, and found employment with the diocese of London. With the onset of World War II, Mander, who saw several of his early works destroyed under German bombardments, first became an auxiliary fireman before joining the Royal Artillery in 1940. He was deployed in North Africa and Italy, and wounded in Salerno.In 1946, he returned to civilian life and resumed his partnership with the diocese of London, restoring several organs damaged during the war. He founded his own company, N.P Mander Limited, later known as Mander Organs, that same year, and married Enid Watson.\nDuring the subsequent years, Mander's craftsmanship gained him wide recognition - as The Guardian's reporter Barry Millington would later write in Mander's obituary,  \"a reputation (for himself) as a restorer of quality and sensitivity\".His crowning achievement was the rebuilding of the organ in St. Paul's Cathedral, between 1972 and 1977, for which he was appointed in the New Year Honours 1979 as a Member of The Order of the British Empire.

There is some dispute in respect of the precise date of installation and the builder.  It was probably built in about 1670, and has been attributed to Bernard \"Father\" Smith, but \"no conclusive evidence has come to light either to substantiate or to dismiss this theory\". It has two manuals, no pedals, and fourteen speaking stops.  It includes three 17th-century reed stops, which is a rarity for the time.  The organ was \"remade\" in about 1680 by Christian Smith, and rebuilt in 1741\u201342 by Glyn and Parker.  In 1958\u201359 it was restored by Noel Mander, at which time it had been derelict for a century or more.  The organ has a \"very fine Renaissance case\", in two tiers.  In the lower tier are the two manual keyboards over which is a row of pipes.  The upper tier consists of five panels containing pipes, which are flanked by Corinthian pilasters.  Over the top is a large curved hood containing gilded statues of putti playing trumpets, and a coat of arms celebrating the marriage of John Legh to Isabella Robartes in 1693.  The hall's website states it is \"without doubt England's most important surviving instrument from the late 17th\u00a0century\".  It has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate.
