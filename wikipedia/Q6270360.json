He played in the Blues' League Cup semi-final against Leeds United in 1996. Bass was Birmingham's first-choice right-back for the 1997-98 season, but lost his place to Jerry Gill towards the end of the season. The subsequent signing of Gary Rowett from Derby County in August 1998, pushed Bass further down the pecking order.\nDuring the next three years Bass only made sporadic appearance for Birmingham, and had a loan spell at Gillingham in 2000. He was released from his contract at the end of the 2000-01 season, having made 68 league appearances for Birmingham.Bass then had spells at Hartlepool United, Pahang FA in Malaysia and Bristol Rovers. After being released by Bristol Rovers at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he left the professional game to become a quantity surveyor in the family business, before joining Salisbury City in July 2006 on a part-time basis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2006\u201307 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["A number of players left the club following the end of the 2005\u201306 season.
