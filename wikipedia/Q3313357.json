He also represented the North of England against Fiji (1982) and Australia (1984).\nHarrison made his England debut during the 1985 tour to New Zealand at the relatively advanced age of 29. England lost both tests, but Harrison scored a breakaway try in each to earn himself the nickname \"Burglar Bill\". Subsequently a local brewery named a drink \"Burglar Bill\" after him.By 1987, Harrison had become a regular fixture in the side, playing in 14 of the next 15 England matches, including all four games of the 1987 Five Nations, one of which was as captain. His appointment came about when current skipper and scrum-half Richard Hill was suspended for allegedly inciting a violent clash with Wales. Mike's first game in charge resulted in victory over Scotland and he marked the occasion with a try.\nHe kept the captaincy for the inaugural World Cup in New Zealand in 1987 where he led by example and enjoyed good try-scoring form. In the opening match against Australia, Harrison scored another breakaway try to give his side a surprise lead. England remained in contention at 6\u20136 but could not respond to losing full-back Marcus Rose to concussion and a highly controversial try scored by David Campese. England lost 19\u20136, but came back to crush Japan, Harrison himself grabbing a hat-trick in thirteen minutes as England racked up ten tries. He scored his fifth try of the tournament against the USA, but England lost to Wales in the quarter-finals, thought by some to have been the worst match of the tournament.\nHarrison played the first two games of the 1988 Five Nations but was then dropped and never again called upon to represent his country.Mike Harrison currently works in banking and occasionally works as an expert summariser on the radio. Harrison is married to Marion with three children; Fiona, Anne and Simon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield", "response": ["Some notable former pupils include the 17th century English physician, John Radcliffe, Joseph Moxon, mathematician and hydrographer to King Charles II, Richard Henry Lee, signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, US Senator and President of the Continental Congress, Sir Francis Molyneux, 7th Baronet, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,  Mike Harrison, former captain England national rugby union team, Mike Tindall, England Rugby Union player, member of the World Cup winning team in 2003, John Potter, Archbishop of Canterbury and the Rt Revd and Rt Hon the Lord Hope of Thornes, former archbishop of York.", "* Mike Harrison, former captain England national rugby union team."]}, {"page": "Wakefield RFC", "response": ["Bryan Barley won the first of his seven England caps in 1983\u201384.
