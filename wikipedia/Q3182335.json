The long-time editor of The Contemporary Review, and contributor to The British Quarterly Review, he became famous for his 1895 biography of Adam Smith, Life of Adam Smith, which replaced the Biographical Memoir of Adam Smith of 1811, by Dugald Stewart, as the standard Smith reference.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adam Smith", "response": ["Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by Romani at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy\u2014characterised by Rae as \"one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period\"\u2014from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing."]}, {"page": "The Wealth of Nations", "response": ["The first edition of the book sold out in six months.John Rae, Life of Adam Smith (London: Macmillan & Co., 1895), p. 285. The printer William Strahan wrote on 12 April 1776 that David Hume said The Wealth of Nations required too much thought to be as popular as Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Strahan also wrote: \"What you say of Mr. Gibbon's and Dr. Smith's book is exactly just. The former is the most popular work; but the sale of the latter, though not near so rapid, has been more than I could have expected from a work that requires much thought and reflection (qualities that do not abound among modern readers) to peruse to any purpose.\"Rae, pp. 285\u201386. Gibbon wrote to Adam Ferguson on 1 April: \"What an excellent work is that with which our common friend Mr. Adam Smith has enriched the public! An extensive science in a single book, and the most profound ideas expressed in the most perspicuous language\".Rae, p. 287. The review of the book in the Annual Register was probably written by Whig MP Edmund Burke.Rae, p. 286.
