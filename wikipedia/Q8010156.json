Those of Mr Green are veritable mountains; he says that he knows their anatomy and he is undoubtedly right.\"In 1819, Green completed a major work, The Tourist's New Guide to the Lake District. But he became troubled, and by 1820 his constitution was weakened.\nHis daughter, Elizabeth, married Walter H Mayson, a famous British violin maker.", "link_mentions": {}}}
