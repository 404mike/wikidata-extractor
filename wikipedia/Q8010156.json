Those of Mr Green are veritable mountains; he says that he knows their anatomy and he is undoubtedly right.\"In 1819, Green completed a major work, The Tourist's New Guide to the Lake District.

Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg.

His was a painstaking and accurate depiction, in drawings, etchings and watercolours, of the topography of the land and of the architecture (he complained of the fad for modernising some of the old vernacular buildings). He became friendly with the Wordsworths and other local gentry and sold many of his engravings to them.

Shaw claimed Greenside was being worked by \"a party of Dutch Adventurers\" (probably meaning German miners) by 1690, but cited no evidence for this, and may have been thinking of other mines in the district. David Gough claimed \"the first documentary evidence of mining at Greenside\" was dated 1784, but also failed to say what that evidence was. Samuel Murphy discovered what he considered \"the first documentary evidence\" in the form of a barrister's brief of 1799, which referred to a Mr. Thompson who was working a mine at Greenside under the Duke of Norfolk. Murphy also found a reference to Greenside in William Green's guide book of 1819. The mines were said to be \"beside the road from Keswick to Patterdale\" and were \"till lately worked by William Sheffield Esquire,\" the mineral agent to the Duke of Devonshire. The road mentioned is clearly the track over Sticks Pass, which passes the old workings at Greenside."]}, {"page": "Glenridding House", "response": ["left|thumb|200px|Drawing by William Green in 1814 called \"Ullswater Head\" showing Glenridding House in the background on the right", "The Reverend Henry Askew (1766-1852) who was the Rector of Greystoke, built the house in about 1810.
