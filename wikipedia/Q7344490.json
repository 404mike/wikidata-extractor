His elder brother Benjamin, and his father, played club cricket, with Joseph initially playing with Duncombe Park C.C. In total he played in seven first-class matches. His bowling was fast, but his action was suspect, and his biggest impact in the sport came when he played for the Scarborough & District against the Australians in 1880, when he damaged Fred Spofforth's finger an injury that prevented him from playing in the subsequent Test match at The Oval. His cousin, Robert Frank, of Pickering played nineteen times for Yorkshire, and captained the Yorkshire Second XI between 1900 and 1914. Joseph Frank later became a timber merchant."]}, {"page": "Robert Frank (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Frank (1924\u20132019) was an important figure in American photography and film.", "Robert Frank may also refer to:", "* Robert Frank (cricketer) (1864\u20131950), English first class cricketer", "* Robert Frank (sculptor) (1902-1975), Swiss sculptor", "* Robert Frank (SS officer) (1910\u20131944), German officer, Knight\u2019s Cross recipient", "* Robert Frank (table tennis) (born 1990), Australian table tennis player", "* Whizzer (Robert Frank), a Golden Age comic book character", "* Nuklo or Robert Frank Jr., a comic book character appearing in Marvel Comics", "* Robert Franks (disambiguation)"]}]}}
