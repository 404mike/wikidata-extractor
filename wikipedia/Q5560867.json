On 15 August 1914, the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form them into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created from the recruits who were flooding in. For example, at a meeting at Gloucester Shire Hall, Maj John Collett (soon to be promoted to command 1/5th Bn) called for 25 men to enlist in the battalion, and as a result nine members of Gloucester Rugby Club (for which his brother Capt Gilbert Collett had played in 1898\u20131904) immediately volunteered from the audience. Later the 2nd Line were mobilised for overseas service in their own right and a 3rd Line created to supply drafts.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Daniell, Appendix I.Grist, p. 49.Gilbert Collett at Gloucester Rugby Heritage.", "* Maj Gilbert Collett acting from 1 April to 11 June 1916", "* Lt-Col Gilbert Collett (from 1/5th Bn) from 8 June to 15 October 1917", "* Lt-Col Gilbert Collett returned 1 February 1918 to 17 March 1918"]}]}}
