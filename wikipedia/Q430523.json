His debut novel, Remainder, was published in 2005 by Metronome. McCarthy has twice been nominated for the Man Booker, and was awarded the inaugural Windham-Campbell Literature Prize by Yale University in 2013. He won a Believer Book Award for Remainder in 2008.\nHe has also written a critical study of Tintin called Tintin and the Secret of Literature, and published an essay collection, Typewriters, Bombs, and Jellyfish, in 2017.

Michael Farr asserted that Herg\u00e9 had \"an acute political conscience\" during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in Tintin in America. Literary critic Tom McCarthy went further, remarking that Tintin in America represented the emergence of a \"left-wing counter tendency\" in Herg\u00e9's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists. This was furthered in The Blue Lotus, in which Herg\u00e9 rejected his \"classically right-wing\" ideas to embrace an anti-imperialist stance, and in a contemporary Quick & Flupke strip in which he lampooned the far right leaders of Germany and Italy, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Herg\u00e9 did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he \"had always had an aversion to it\" and commenting that \"to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am.\""]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Tintin", "response": ["The first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was Tintin and the Secret of Literature, written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006. McCarthy compares Herg\u00e9's work with that of Aeschylus, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself. McCarthy considered the Adventures of Tintin to be \"stupendously rich\", containing \"a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text\" which, influenced by Tisseron's psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from bartering to implicit sexual intercourse that Herg\u00e9 had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in The Telegraph, Toby Clements argued that McCarthy's work, and literary criticism of Herg\u00e9's comic strips in general, cut \"perilously close\" to simply feeding \"the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive\" in the Tintinological community.", "Following Herg\u00e9's death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the Adventures of Tintin were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres. Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: pornographic, political, and artistic. In a number of cases, the actual name \"Tintin\" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books."]}, {"page": "Cigars of the Pharaoh", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the prominent role of tobacco in the story, drawing on the ideas of French philosopher Jacques Derrida to suggest the potential symbolism of this. He also suggested that the inclusion of mummified Egyptologists in the story warns readers of the \"dangers of mummification through interpretation\"."]}, {"page": "King Ottokar's Sceptre", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws."]}, {"page": "The Red Sea Sharks", "response": ["In his psychoanalytical study of The Adventures of Tintin, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s expressed the view that The Red Sea Sharks reflected a world in which traditional values have been degraded and everything \u2013 including human life \u2013 has become a commodity. He added that Rastapopoulos becomes \"the embodiment of the global market\" in this story, tying together all of the other characters and therefore replacing Tintin as the figure \"at the centre of the universe\". Apostolid\u00e8s opined that The Red Sea Sharks amplifies \"the theme of the general equivalence of everything\" that is present in the series, serving as \"a kind of retrospective\" by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them. He believed that the theme of the mirage pervaded the story, appearing repeatedly in such forms as Abdullah's cuckoo clock which concealed a water squirter and the pseudonyms employed by the various characters throughout the narrative. The literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that The Red Sea Sharks exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout The Adventures of Tintin. He believed that a scene in which one of Bab El Ehr's men spies on the Emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout the series. McCarthy also highlighted Tintin's actions in returning Abdullah to Khemed, expressing the view that it is part of a wider running theme throughout the series in which the hero takes an abandoned children to their home; other instances included Tintin's discovery of an adoptive family for the orphan Chang Chong-Chen in The Blue Lotus and the delivery of the lost gypsy child Miarka to her family in The Castafiore Emerald."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|Tom McCarthy || C || Jonathan Cape", "| Tom McCarthy|| Satin Island|| Jonathan Cape", "*Tom McCarthy"]}, {"page": "Tintin and Alph-Art", "response": ["The literary critic Tom McCarthy suggested that some of the early scenes of the book \"take the form almost of Platonic dialogues, dramatized theoretical discussions about art itself\", although later in the book Herg\u00e9 turns to revealing \"the deeper and more essential Platonic truth of art: that it is fake, that its whole currency is fakeness\". Discussing the final scene in the book, he opined that it \"reads like a snuff movie: not of Tintin, ultimately, but of Herg\u00e9\". Further, he argued that Tintin and Alph-Art reflected a number of themes that also appear in other Adventures of Tintin; these include the idea of Castafiore bridging the connection between the protagonist and the villains, and the concept of Haddock being confronted \"with his own inauthenticity\", in this case through purchasing a giant plastic 'H' artwork."]}, {"page": "Turner Prize", "response": ["The shortlist was drawn up by writer and critic Oliver Basciano, Elena Filipovic, director, Kunsthalle Basel; Lisa Le Feuvre, executive director of Holt/Smithson Foundation; and novelist Tom McCarthy.

He believed that this was partly due to the influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Herg\u00e9's \"European absolutism\", and overall thought of it as \"the most visually rich of all the Tintin books\". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi\u00a0\u2013 who was poisoned with Raijaijah\u00a0\u2013 inverted \"the model of justice ruling the world of the Good\". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have \"feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and the patience of an animal stalking its prey\". He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his Oedipus complex and was a substitute for castration."]}, {"page": "Tintin in America", "response": ["Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University thought that in Tintin in America, Herg\u00e9 had intentionally depicted the wealthy industrialists as being very similar to the gangsters. He noted that this negative portrayal of capitalists continued into later Adventures of Tintin with characters such as Basil Bazarov in The Broken Ear. He considered this indicative of \"a more ambivalent stance\" to the right-wing agenda that Herg\u00e9 had formerly adhered to. Another literary critic, Tom McCarthy, concurred, believing that Tintin in America exhibited Herg\u00e9's \"left-wing counter tendency\" through attacking the racism and capitalist mass production of the U.S. McCarthy believed that the work exposed social and political process as a \"mere charade\", much as Herg\u00e9 had previously done in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. Years later, while brainstorming what ultimately became Tintin in Tibet, Herg\u00e9 considered bringing Tintin back to the United States to aid a group of Native Americans in defending themselves from a large corporation willing to drill their land for oil, but Herg\u00e9 felt in reflection that retracing old ground would be a step backwards and discarded the idea."]}, {"page": "St Alfege Church, Greenwich", "response": ["In Tom McCarthy's novel C, after a Marinettiesque car crash, Serge Carrefax laughs from his position within the upturned chassis. This laughter is \"a pleasant noise; reminds him of liturgical chants and whispers echoing around St. Alfege's interior.\""]}, {"page": "Flight 714 to Sydney", "response": ["The literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that Flight 714 to Sydney exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout the Adventures of Tintin more widely. He opined that the troubles faced by Tintin and Haddock aboard Carreidas' jet reflected the theme of the \"troubled host\u2013guest relationship\". He believed that Rastapopoulos' activities below the area that he could be located by radar reflected the theme of eluding detection. In addition, he expressed the view that the flagging relationship of Haddock and Calculus, as it is depicted in Flight 714 to Sydney, is a form of the wider theme of strained relationships in the series. McCarthy also highlighted the scene at the start the story in which Haddock mistakes Carreidas for someone trapped in poverty and gives him some money accordingly; McCarthy drew parallels between this scene and a similar one from Charles Baudelaire's poem \"La Fausse Monnaie\", suggesting that Herg\u00e9 might have been thinking of Baudelaire's scene when creating his own."]}, {"page": "The Crab with the Golden Claws", "response": ["Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University, in a psychoanalytical review of The Crab with the Golden Claws, commented that this book witnessed Tintin's \"real entrance into the community of human beings\" as he gains an \"older brother\" in Haddock. He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed that there was a strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However, Apostolid\u00e8s notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred with Apostolid\u00e8s on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes. He also noted that in this Adventure, the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of \"Tintin the detective\" found throughout the series."]}, {"page": "The Shooting Star", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that The Shooting Star represents the apex of the \"right-wing strain\" in Herg\u00e9's work. He highlighted the instance in which Tintin impersonates God in order to give commands to Philippus as representing one of various occasions in The Adventures of Tintin where \"sacred authority manifests itself largely as a voice, and commanding\u2014or commandeering\u2014that voice is what guarantees power\". McCarthy further observes that the image of a giant spider in a ball of fire, which appears near the start of the story, reflects the theme of madness that is again present throughout the series. Discussing the political elements of Herg\u00e9's series, McCarthy also noted that in the original publication of the story, the spider which climbed in front of the observatory telescope and was thus magnified greatly was initially termed Aranea Fasciata; he saw this as an intentional satire of the threat to Europe posed by fascism."]}, {"page": "Tintin in Tibet", "response": ["The literary analysis of Tom McCarthy compares Tintin's quest to Herg\u00e9's conquest of his own fear and guilt, writing, \"this is the moira of Herg\u00e9's own white mythology, his anaemic destiny: to become Sarrasine to Tintin's la Zambinella\".

We have therefore sent Tintin, one of our top reporters, to Soviet Russia\". The illusion of Tintin as a real reporter for the paper, and not a fictional character, was emphasised by the claim that the comic strip was not a series of drawings, but composed of photographs taken of Tintin's adventure. Biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thought this a private joke between staff at ; alluding to the fact that Herg\u00e9 had originally been employed as a reporter-photographer, a job that he never fulfilled. Literary critic Tom McCarthy later compared this approach to that of 18th-century European literature, which often presented fictional narratives as non-fiction.", "In his study of the cultural and literary legacy of Brussels, Andr\u00e9 De Vries remarked that Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was \"crude by Herg\u00e9's later standards, in every sense of the word\". Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the \"worst\" of the Adventures, being \"poorly drawn\" and \"largely plot-free\". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Herg\u00e9 had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University, Herg\u00e9 cast the Bolsheviks as \"absolute evil\" but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet \"world of misery\" and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as \"fairly straightforward\" and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as \"pantomime cut-outs\"."]}, {"page": "The Broken Ear", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that Balthazar was an example of the interesting minor characters that imbue the Adventures, commenting that his \"down-at-heel garret speaks volumes of loneliness and semi-realised artistry\". He also opined that the diamond within the fetish was the clitoris of the Arumbaya, describing it as \"their pleasure, wrapped up in a fetish\". He also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between Ram\u00f3n and Alonso, believing that the scene in which a bullet was fired into Ram\u00f3n's buttocks was symbolic of anal sex."]}, {"page": "Tintin in the Congo", "response": ["In his psychoanalytical study of the series, Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s highlighted that in the Congolese adventure, Tintin represented progress and the Belgian state was depicted as a model for the natives to imitate. In doing so, he argued, they could become more European and thus civilised from the perspective of Belgian society, but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies. Opining that Tintin was imposing his own view of Africa onto the Congolese, Apostolid\u00e8s remarked that Tintin appeared as a god-figure, with evangelical overtones in the final scene. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred that Tintin represented the Belgian state, but also suggested that he acted as a Christian missionary, even being \"a kind of god\" akin to the character of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899). McCarthy compared the scene where Tintin exposes Muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of Prospero exposes the magician in William Shakespeare's The Tempest.", "In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised Tintin in the Congo as racist due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to Tom McCarthy, Herg\u00e9 depicted the Congolese as \"good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\". There had been no such controversy when originally published, because it was only following the decolonization of Africa, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted. Harry Thompson argued that one must view Tintin in the Congo in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Herg\u00e9 had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more \"patronising\" than malevolent. Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s supported this idea, as did biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters, who asserted, \"Herg\u00e9 was no more racist than the next man\". After meeting Herg\u00e9 in the 1980s, Farr commented, \"You couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist.\""]}, {"page": "The Black Island", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that The Black Island linked to Herg\u00e9's other Adventures in various ways; he connected the counterfeit money in the story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn."]}, {"page": "The Secret of the Unicorn", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the scene in which Tintin was imprisoned in the Marlinspike crypt, observing that it had parallels with Tintin's exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout the series. He identified the mystery left in Francis Haddock's parchments to be another appearance of Tintin's adventures being \"framed by enigmas\". To this he adds that in solving the enigma, Tintin shows that he is \"the best reader\" in the series, and it is this which establishes him as \"the oeuvre's hero\". McCarthy praised Herg\u00e9's Silk as one of the pivotal characters in the series who can \"exude a presence far beyond that which we might expect from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist\"."]}, {"page": "Red Rackham's Treasure", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted what he perceived as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He pointed out that in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus was one of many stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was one of a number of calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws."]}, {"page": "Tintin and the Picaros", "response": ["The literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that Tintin and the Picaros reflected a number of themes found throughout The Adventures of Tintin. For instance, he believed that the theme of eavesdropping was exhibited in the scene in which Nestor the butler listens in on Tintin and Haddock's argument. He also expressed the view that Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus' imprisonment in their Los Dopicos hotel reflected the \"uneasy host\u2013guest relationship\" theme."]}, {"page": "The Seven Crystal Balls", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy also praised Tarragon, stating that he exudes a presence \"far beyond what we might expect from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist\". He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He argued that the way in which Alcazar was presented as Tintin's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Herg\u00e9's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb."]}, {"page": "Prisoners of the Sun", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Herg\u00e9's use of jewellery as a theme throughout the series, and that the scene in which Tintin commands the sun god to do his bidding reflects a wider theme throughout the series in which \"sacred authority\" manifests through voice. The scene in which Haddock causes an avalanche of snow by sneezing reflected what McCarthy considered a wider theme of the danger of sound, while Zorrino's decision to stay among the Inca was interpreted as a reflection of a wider theme of adoption. Commenting on the execution scene, McCarthy believed that it represented Haddock being \"sacrificed on the altar of his own illegitimacy\", a concept that he felt had been echoed throughout the series."]}, {"page": "Land of Black Gold", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that in the story, the desert represented \"a space of multiple misreading\", which included the mirages, fake documents, and cases of mistaken identity. Focusing on those fake documents, he believed that it represented the theme of fakery which recurs throughout the series. Describing the scenario in which Thomson and Thompson are lost and driving around the desert, he refers to it as a \"brilliantly allegorical scene\", before highlighting Herg\u00e9's \"wishful retroactive wiping out of history\" by evading the war."]}, {"page": "Explorers on the Moon", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that in the Destination Moon-Explorers of the Moon story arc, Calculus \"embodies Herg\u00e9's... own wartime position, spun out into a post-war environment\", representing a genius driven by his work whose activities are coincidental to national and political causes. He suggested that Explorers on the Moon was \"perhaps both the most wildly adventurous and the most contemplative\" instalment in the series. He felt that the inclusion of Jorgen being smuggled aboard the rocket as a stowaway reflected the idea of the \"stranger\" penetrating the \"home\", something which he thought was present in other Adventures. Commenting on the scene in which Haddock smuggles a whisky bottle inside the Guide to Astronomy, he states \"the text, in this case, is hollow, smuggling something else\", which he believed was a reversal of the appearance of a parchment hidden within a model ship in The Secret of the Unicorn."]}, {"page": "The Calculus Affair", "response": ["Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that The Calculus Affair aptly illustrated how Tintin was no longer political in the manner that he was in earlier works like Tintin in the Land of the Soviets (1930) and Tintin in the Congo (1931); instead, Tintin travels to Borduria to rescue Calculus, \"not to fight or expose totalitarianism\". Calculus became \"a genius compromised\", with his role being a \"counter-position to, or flip-side of, the one he represented in the moon books\". When Tintin and Haddock arrive in Borduria, they are \"treated as honoured guests but are in fact prisoners of the police state\", a reversal of the situation in The Blue Lotus in which Tintin believes himself a prisoner but is in fact a guest. As with The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Calculus Affair was \"one long tobacco-trail\" with cigarettes representing clues throughout the story. As for the opera house scene in which Tintin and Haddock spy upon Sponsz and Castafiore, he compared it to the scene in David Lynch's 1986 film Blue Velvet in which Jeffrey Beaumont spies on the sexual activities of Dorothy Vallens and Frank Booth."]}, {"page": "Birkbeck, University of London", "response": ["Meanwhile, the London Consortium graduate school \u2014 a collaboration between Birkbeck, the Tate Galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the Architectural Association, and, until 1999, the British Film Institute \u2013 has been running since the mid-1990s, offering masters and doctoral degrees in the interdisciplinary humanities and cultural studies, resourced and jointly taught by all the participating institutions.
