Allen's transfer record was broken in March 1956, when the club paid Fulham \u00a325,000 for Bobby Robson. The club reached the FA Cup semi-finals again in 1956\u201357, only to lose out to eventual winners Aston Villa, following a replay. Albion managed to improve their league form in 1957\u201358, finishing fourth, as Robson and Derek Kevan's strike partnership replaced that of Allen's and Nicholls'. Though Nicholls departed, Allen remained a key member of the first team, as West Brom finished fifth in 1958\u201359; he further enhanced his legendary status at Albion by scoring the equaliser late in the game against Aston Villa to send Albion's biggest rivals down. New manager Gordon Clark led West Brom to a fourth-place finish in 1959\u201360, which was followed by a tenth-place finish in 1960\u201361."]}, {"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["Dougan dropped down to the Third Division to join Peterborough United for a \u00a321,000 fee in the summer of 1963. He later admitted that \"I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player\". The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963\u201364 season, and at the end of the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said \"renewed my sense of vocation\". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964\u201365 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2\u20131 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that \"after playing at Stamford Bridge it was not easy to go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up\"."]}]}}
