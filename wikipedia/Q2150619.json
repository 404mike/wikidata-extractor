The guidance on compassionate release of a terminally ill prisoner under Scottish law specifies that death must be likely to occur \"soon\"; there is no fixed time limit but a life expectancy of three months is suggested as \"appropriate\". The Labour MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife and a Minister in the previous Labour administration, Dr. Richard Simpson, accused the Scottish justice minister of failing to conduct sufficient checks before deciding to release Megrahi. Dr. Simpson, a former member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons' prostate cancer working group who specialised in prostate disease research, expressed doubt that Megrahi would die within the next three months and claimed that he could live for eight months, going on to say that, \"Kenny MacAskill released him apparently on the advice of just one doctor whose status is not clear and who is not named.\" He added that a second specialist opinion in palliative care should have been sought before the release. A source close to the justice secretary called Simpson's comments \"tasteless\" and added: \"I really don't think we should be speculating on the day somebody is going to die.\""]}, {"page": "Ochil (Scottish Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Richard Simpson"]}]}}
