His own poetry was mostly written in English and Modernist in style but was very much influenced by Welsh poetic tradition, Welsh culture and history. To some extent there are parallels in Conran's writing with that of R. S. Thomas, but Conran can also be seen in the line of Pound, Bunting and MacDairmid.\nHe was born in Kharghpur, Bengal, India but, because he suffered from cerebral palsy, he was brought to the UK in 1933 and largely brought up by his grandparents in Colwyn Bay, being separated from his parents by the Second War. He was educated at Colwyn Bay High School, took his degree at Bangor and other than a brief spell working at a factory in Essex, Conran spent most of his working life in Bangor, North Wales.\nUntil 1983, he taught at the Bangor University, where he was tutor in the English Department. Academically, he took a particular interest in Welsh poetry, both in Welsh and English; also in traditional folksong and ballads. After retiring from academic life, Conran continued to develop his own poetic art, often combining dramatic presentation of his work in conjunction with visual and performance artists.\nConran's first collection of original poetry was Formal Poems (1958). His numerous other collections include Stelae and Other Poems (1965), Spirit Level (1974), and Life Fund (1979). He has also written many critiques of Welsh literature, including a collection of essays entitled The Cost of Strangeness (Gomer Press, 1982). In 1967, he produced a celebrated collection of Welsh language poetry in translation, Welsh Verse (Penguin). This collection was re-published in 1982 by Poetry Wales Press with an extensive and influential introductory essay by Conran. He has also edited a collection of poetry by South Wales poet Idris Davies. He was married to Lesley Conran. His daughters are the visual artist Maia Conran and the novelist Alys Conran.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Tony Conran (1931\u20132013, W)"]}, {"page": "Welsh literature in English", "response": ["David Jones also first published in the late 1930s, yet he belongs more to the post-war era.

M. Wynn Thomas.", "Tony Conran (born 1931) is an important figure in this so-called second flowering as critic, poet, and translator of Welsh poetry. His Penguin Book of Welsh Verse (1967) has been especially helpful in bridging the gap between the Welsh and English speaking. In his own poetry he makes use of Welsh tradition: for example, his elegy for Welsh soldiers killed in the Falklands War is modelled on Aneirin's Y Gododdin.Pocket Guide. Swansea poet Harri Webb's (1920\u20131994) verse, including The Green Desert (1969), is marked in its themes by a radical and uncompromising commitment to Welsh nationalist politics. Another important poet of the late twentieth century is Tony Curtis (born 1946) from Carmarthen: he is the author of several collections, most recently War Voices (1995), The Arches (1998), and Heaven's Gate (2001). John Tripp (1927\u201386), a convinced Welsh nationalist, was ironically aware of the fact that, while born in Wales, he had worked outside the Principality until his early forties."]}, {"page": "Waldo Williams", "response": ["A significant collection of Williams's poetry has been translated into English by Tony Conran.

The poem's mockery also extends to the English interlopers in Wales, and at least one reader has complained of its racial prejudice on that account.  But the critic Tony Conran sees \"Trouble at a Tavern\" as being not just a comic romp but a poem shot through with multiple layers of irony, most notably in its hints that the Welsh hero is playing at being an Anglo-Norman lordling, and therefore getting a justified comeuppance.  He also sees the possibility in the poem's final pious words of an ironic irreverence towards God himself.  But perhaps it is simply a warning to impetuous young men not to be so foolish."]}, {"page": "Alys Conran", "response": ["Alys Conran was born in north-west Wales, and is the daughter of the poet and translator Tony Conran.
