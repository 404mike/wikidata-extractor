He was the son of Charles Pelham, 4th Earl of Yarborough and Marcia Pelham, Countess of Yarborough. On 31 January 1911, Lord Worsley married Alexandra Mary Freesia Vivian, daughter of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian and the former Louisa Alice Duff, and sister-in-law of General Haig. Worsley was killed in action during the First World War, aged 27.\nDue to Charles Worsley's death at a relatively young age, the title of Earl of Yarborough later passed directly from his father to his younger brother, Sackville George Pelham, who also assumed Charles's courtesy title of Lord Worsley.", "link_mentions": {}}}
