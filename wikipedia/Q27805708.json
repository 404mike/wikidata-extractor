He was educated at the local grammar school and won a scholarship to study English at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After graduating from Oxford, he claimed unemployment benefits, and moved into a property in Brixton with other former Oxford students. He credits this period with teaching him the craft of writing. His debut novel, The Colour of Memory, is set in Brixton in the 1980s, the decade that Dyer lived there. The novel has been described as a \"fictionalization of Dyer's 20s\". He is married to Rebecca Wilson, chief curator at Saatchi Art, Los Angeles. He currently lives in Venice, California. In March 2014, Dyer said he had had a minor stroke earlier in the year, shortly after moving to live in Venice, Los Angeles.Dyer, Geoff Diary London Review of Books, Vol. 36 No. 7 \u2013 3 April 2014."]}, {"page": "Henry Grahn Hermunen", "response": ["*Grahn Hermunen at Saatchi Art Top 10 list as No:2 chosen by Rebecca Wilson (curator) chief curator and vice president of Art Advisory at Saatchi Art the world\u2019s leading online art gallery, based in Los Angeles "]}, {"page": "List of people named Rebecca", "response": ["*Rebecca Wilson Bresee (fl. 1990s\u20132010s), American computer animator at Disney", "*Rebecca Wilson (curator), art curator and editor", "*Rebecca Wilson (1961\u20132016), Australian sports journalist, radio and television broadcaster and personality"]}]}}
