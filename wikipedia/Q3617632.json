Lambton or \"Nancy\" Lambton, was a British historian and expert on medieval and early modern Persian history, Persian language, Islamic political theory, and Persian social organisation.  She was an acknowledged authority on land tenure and reform in Iran (including Saljuq, Mongol, Safavid and Qajar administration and institutions, and local and tribal histories).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jizya", "response": ["Commentators disagree on the definition and derivation of the word jizya. Ann Lambton writes that the origins of jizya are extremely complex, regarded by some jurists as \"compensation paid by non-Muslims for being spared from death\" and by others as \"compensation for living in Muslim lands.\"", "Ann Lambton states that the jizya was to be paid \"in humiliating conditions\". Ennaji and other scholars state that some jurists required the jizya to be paid by each in person, by presenting himself, arriving on foot not horseback, by hand, in order to confirm that he lowers himself to being a subjected one, and willingly pays. According to Mark R. Cohen, the Quran itself does not prescribe humiliating treatment for the dhimmi when paying Jizya, but some later Muslims interpreted it to contain \"an equivocal warrant for debasing the dhimmi (non-Muslim) through a degrading method of remission\". In contrast, the 13th century hadith scholar and Shafi'ite jurist Al-Nawaw\u012b, comments on those who would impose a humiliation along with the paying of the jizya, stating, \"As for this aforementioned practice, I know of no sound support for it in this respect, and it is only mentioned by the scholars of Khurasan. The majority of scholars say that the jizya is to be taken with gentleness, as one would receive a debt. The reliably correct opinion is that this practice is invalid and those who devised it should be refuted. It is not related that the Prophet or any of the rightly-guided caliphs did any such thing when collecting the jizya.\"Al-Nawaw\u012b, Raw\u1e0dat al-\u1e6c\u0101lib\u012bn wa \u201bUmdat al-Muft\u012bn, vol. 10, pp. 315\u20136. al-Maktab al-Islamiy.

Ann Lambton states that non-Muslims had no share in the benefits from the public treasury derived from jizya.

Maktabat al-'Adib. Evidence of jizya benefitting non-residents and temporary residents of an Islamic state is found in the treaty Khalid bin al-Walid concluded with the people of Al-Hirah of Iraq, wherein any aged person who was weak, had lost his or her ability to work, fallen ill, or who had been rich but became poor, would be exempt from jiyza and his or livelihood and the livelihood of his or her dependents, who were not living permanently in the Islamic state, would be met by Bayt al-Mal.

I assured them that any [non-Muslim] person who is unable to earn his livelihood, or is struck by disaster, or who becomes destitute and is helped by the charity of his fellow men will be exempted from the jizya and he and his family will be supplied with sustenance by the Bayt al-Mal (public treasury), and this, as long as he's staying in the abode of Islam (dar al-Islam).\" Quote:
