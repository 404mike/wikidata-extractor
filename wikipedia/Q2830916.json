He made one appearance for England on 7 April 1888 when he scored three goals in a 5\u20131 victory over Ireland, thus making him one of the five England players who scored a hat trick on his only international appearance.He first joined Villa in August 1884 (before the foundation of the Football League), played in the first Villa League team to debut at Dudley Road, Wolverhampton, then home of Wolverhampton Wanderer's. The match ended 1-1. He scored Villa's first Football League hat-trick in a 9\u20131 home win over Notts County on 29 September 1888, his debut League goal was on 15 September 1888 at Wellington Road, in a 5\u20131 win over Stoke. When he made his League debut he was 21 years 146 days old; that made him, on that first day of League football, Aston Villa's youngest league player. Allen only missed one League match, out of 22, and top-scored in 1888\u20131889 with 18 League goals and 1 in the FA Cup. Played as a forward in a forward line that scored three-League-goals-or-more-in-a-match on six separate occasions. Developed an understanding with Dennis Hodgetts. He made 44 league appearances for Aston Villa, scoring 27 goals. He died of tuberculosis, which had ended his career prematurely, aged 32.\nA light, but most effective wing player, with a good turn of speed. Lack of weight and size did not affect his pluck. Dribbled like an artist and shot with force and good aim. Always did well in big games and was seen to special advantage in his international.
