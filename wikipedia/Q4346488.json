Hecker. After learning Kryptonian information from the historical archives on a scout ship that crashed, Lex Luthor uses General Zod's body to create a \"Kryptonian Deformity\", an act which had been forbidden by the Kryptonian Council prior to the planet's destruction. He finds out from the computer that this has been done \"before\" once by the Council, meaning that the real Doomsday could still be out there. Luthor places the lifeless corpse into the Genesis Chamber and gives the creature life with his own blood. In the climax of the film, Luthor sets the creature loose upon hatching from its \"egg sack\" to kill Superman, after Batman declines to do so, deeming the creature the Man of Steel's \"Doomsday\". During the battle, Doomsday displays massive superhuman strength, durability and stamina, as well as the ability to \"evolve\" and regenerate at an incredibly fast pace, growing bone protrusions and gaining more muscle mass, in addition to being able to absorb energy and fire heat blasts from his eyes and mouth. When Superman flies the monster into space and the military fires a nuclear missile with the hopes of incinerating him, Doomsday survives and absorbs the nuclear energy, gaining the ability to discharge electrical blasts from his body, capable of levelling a few city blocks at once. Although Wonder Woman soon joins the battle, Doomsday's strength proves to be far greater than that of the two heroes combined. However, Batman later surmises that because Doomsday was created from Kryptonian technology, he shares Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite. Lois retrieves the spear while Wonder Woman cuts off Doomsday's right hand and holds him down using the Lasso of Truth and Batman uses his last kryptonite round to weaken the monster. Doomsday is then killed when Superman impales him with Batman's kryptonite spear, but not before the creature gets a chance to stab the hero with a new large bone protrusion from his severed wrist, resulting in the demise of both characters. However, Superman was later resurrected in Justice League in the same chamber used to create Doomsday.16 'Batman v Superman' Spoilers For Those Too Eager To Wait Doomsday also made a brief cameo in a prologue of the Snyder Cut, picking up where the previous film left off.
