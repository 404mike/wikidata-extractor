Bishop Middleton suggested as a site for the new cathedral the part of the city now known as \"Fives Court\", where the cathedral now stands. In 1762 the area had been described as a forest so wild that it harbored tigers and at first it was regarded as \"too far south\" to serve as a location for the cathedral. Middleton died in 1822 before building plans took shape. The next three bishops  Reginald Heber, Thomas James and John Turner  all died after brief tenures, and it was not until 1832, under Bishop Daniel Wilson, that the project to build the cathedral was revived."]}, {"page": "Diocese of Calcutta (Church of North India)", "response": ["| Thomas James"]}, {"page": "John James", "response": ["* Thomas James (bishop) (John Thomas James, 1786\u20131828), Church of England bishop of Calcutta, 1827\u20131828"]}, {"page": "Thomas James (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas James (c. 1573\u20131629) was an English librarian and Anglican clergyman.", "*Thomas James (died 1619), English politician", "*General Thomas James (1782\u20131847), trapper who served in the Illinois Legislature, was a General in the Illinois Militia, and served in the Black Hawk War", "*Thomas James (sea captain) (1593\u20131635), Arctic explorer", "*Thomas James (minister) (1804\u20131891), former slave who wrote a short memoir", "*Thomas James (businessman) (born 1940s), American businessman, chairman of Raymond James", "*Thomas James (bishop) (1786\u20131828), Anglican bishop in India"]}, {"page": "Bishop of West Malaysia", "response": ["| Thomas James"]}, {"page": "John Thomas James", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas James (bishop)"]}]}}
