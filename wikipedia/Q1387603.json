Club said Wah Wah was \"a diverse, patchwork-sounding record that touched on abstract electronic experiments and noisy rock tangles.\"", "Although James are an alternative rock and indie rock band, and Wah Wah is characterized as an experimental rock album, the album is sometimes seen as an electronic dance and ambient album. Joseph Gallivan of The Independent described it as \"mainly electronic, and features lead singer Tim Booth experimenting with freely associative lyrics in a falsetto voice.\" Emma Forrest of the NME took the album to be more of a textural record, saying \"it's an ambient album, with something to hook onto - moving wallpaper in the nicest possible sense. It's one of the few genuinely engaging dance albums around.\" Besides the NME, Amost Cool, Entertainment Weekly and Q also considered it an ambient album, but the latter also noted that \"like all such jams, [the album shows] the band perm grooves, riffs, chants, licks and lyrical snatches in various stages of dress but still too naked to leave the house.\" They also considered the album to contain Eno's industrial dance sound.

The album features a more anthemetic re-recording of \"Tomorrow\" (which had appeared on Wah Wah), which was released as the album's second single, reaching number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. For that album's follow-up, Millionaires (1999), the band regrouped with Eno as official producer for the first time since the Laid and Wah Wah sessions.
