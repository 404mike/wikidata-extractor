After graduating from Kingston Polytechnic with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical and aeronautical engineering he went to work for the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. In 1979 he moved to British Aerospace at Weybridge, working on aircraft wing design and composites engineering.\nHis motor racing career did not start until 1985 when he was hired to join the FORCE Lola team at Colnbrook. When that team closed down in 1986 he moved to Tyrrell Racing, as a composites and race engineer. After a brief spell with the March Alfa Romeo Indycar program he moved to Team Lotus following the departure of chief designer Mike Coughlan. This coincided with the takeover of the team by Peter Collins and Peter Wright, and Coppuck was involved in the design of the team's aborted Lotus 103 car, and in revamping the Lotus 102 design.\nAt the end of 1991 he moved to the United States where he worked in CART with Dick Simon Racing. Later that year he returned to Britain and became technical director of TOM'S GB, working with John Barnard on the design of a secret Formula One car. When Toyota decided not to enter, Coppuck joined Pacific Grand Prix as chief designer for the Pacific PR02. After Pacific closed its doors at the end of the 1995 season Coppuck moved to Benetton but stayed only a year before going back to TOM'S GB. He then moved on to McLaren where he was in charge of the McLaren GT program.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1995 British Grand Prix", "response": ["The lack of on-track action caused by the wet conditions and the two-day qualifying system was a cause for concern amongst the Formula One paddock, members of which believed that members of the public who had paid to attend the session (spectator numbers were estimated at 40,000), or watch it on television, were being short-changed as a result. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis argued that the restriction on the use of the teams' spare cars should be lifted in the event of wet weather conditions, whilst Pacific designer Frank Coppuck advocated a points system for qualifying, in addition to aggregating the times over both days. FIA President Max Mosley confirmed that the current qualifying procedure was to be the subject of a review, with possible changes due to be introduced for the 1996 season. One-day qualifying was subsequently introduced from the 1996 Australian Grand Prix onwards."]}, {"page": "Pacific PR02", "response": ["The Pacific PR02 was a Formula One car for the 1995 season. The number 17 car was driven by Andrea Montermini, and the number 16 car was driven by team shareholder Bertrand Gachot, and later pay drivers Giovanni Lavaggi and Jean-Denis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz, before Gachot returned. The team's test driver was Oliver Gavin. The engine was a Ford EDC 3.0 V8. The team did not have a main sponsor. The car was designed by Frank Coppuck."]}, {"page": "Paul Crooks", "response": ["Crooks began his career as an apprentice aeronautical engineer when he was 17 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment based in Farnborough. He spent five years there before joining RAE at the age of 22. For the next five years he worked as a detail designer on aerospace projects, working alongside Frank Coppuck. From there, he got a job with Toleman Group Motorsport (later Benetton Formula, then Renault F1) as a detail designer. He worked under Rory Byrne for the next six years, before moving up to chief composite design engineer in 1983."]}, {"page": "Gordon Coppuck", "response": ["In 1971 he became chief designer at McLaren, responsible for various models including the Indianapolis 500 M16 and world championship winning M23. When McLaren merged with Ron Dennis's Project Four in 1980, Coppuck departed, rejoining Herd at March. The following year he founded Spirit with March's Formula Two team manager John Wickham. Spirit raced in Formula Two and then Formula One before Coppuck returned to March. Coppuck's nephew Frank Coppuck is also a racing car designer."]}, {"page": "Coppuck", "response": ["*Frank Coppuck, British motorsport engineer"]}]}}
