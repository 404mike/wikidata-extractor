King held a significant position at the convention despite his youthful stature, as \"he numbered among the most capable orators.\" Along with James Madison, \"he became a leading figure in the nationalist causus.\" Furthermore, he attended every session. King's major involvements included serving on the Committee on Postponed Matters and the Committee of Style and Arrangement. Although when he came to the convention, he was unconvinced that major changes should be made in the Articles of Confederation, his views underwent a startling transformation during the debates. He worked with Chairman William Samuel Johnson, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, and Alexander Hamilton on the Committee of Style and Arrangement to prepare a final draft of the U.S. Constitution. King is one of the more prominent delegates namely because of playing \"a major role in the laborious crafting of the fundamental governing character\" The constitution was signed on September 17 but needed to be ratified by the states. After signing the Constitution, he returned home and went to work to get the Constitution ratified and unsuccessfully position himself to be named to the U.S. Senate. The ratification passed by the narrow margin of 187\u2013168 votes. With the ratification passed, Massachusetts \"became the sixth state to ratify [the] constitution in early February 1788. Rufus is indirectly responsible for the passing of this ratification seeing that his \"learned, informative, and persuasive speeches\" were able to convince a \"popular, vain merchant and prince-turned-politicians to abandon his anti-federalism and approve the new organic law.\""]}, {"page": "Robert Lowell", "response": ["His mother was a descendant of William Samuel Johnson, a signer of the United States Constitution; Jonathan Edwards, the Calvinist theologian (about whom Lowell wrote the poems \"Mr. Edwards and the Spider,\" \"Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts,\" \"After the Surprising Conversions,\" and \"The Worst Sinner\"); Anne Hutchinson, the Puritan preacher and healer; Robert Livingston (who was also an ancestor on Lowell's paternal side); Thomas Dudley, the second governor of Massachusetts; and Mayflower passengers James Chilton and his daughter Mary Chilton.
