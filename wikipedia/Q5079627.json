Elements of the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Powell, were used to occupy these sites.

Otherwise, no major operations took place in the Basra area. The principal difficulty was that there were insufficient troops to take over Maqil, Ashar, and Basra City concurrently. While the Iraqi troops in Basra agreed to withdraw on 2 May, they failed to do so. On 6 May, the 21st Indian Infantry Brigade under the command of Brigadier Charles Joseph Weld arrived and disembarked at Basra. This was the 10th Indian Infantry Division's second brigade to arrive in Iraq. The 21st Indian Infantry Brigade included 4th battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles, 2nd battalion 4th Gurkha Rifles, and 2nd battalion 10th Gurkha Rifles."]}, {"page": "Charles Weld", "response": ["* Charles Joseph Weld (1893\u20131962), officer in the British Indian Army"]}, {"page": "Weld (name)", "response": ["* Charles Joseph Weld (1893-1962), officer in the British Indian Army in both World wars"]}]}}
