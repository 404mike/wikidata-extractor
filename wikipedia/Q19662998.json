His lawyer, Nick Kaufman, protested about the move stating \"extradition suggests that this was a legal process where Saadi Gadhafi was accorded a lawyer, a court hearing, and\u2026it's not even clear to me that that even took place\"."]}, {"page": "Interpol notice", "response": ["The CCF's most notable function, however, is to consider legal petitions submitted by individuals requesting the revocation of red notices. Such petitions, as a rule, only succeed when a red notice is deemed to infringe Interpol's Constitution either because it offends the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or because it was issued for political, religious, military, or racial reasons. In an interview given to Forbes Africa Magazine in July 2013, leading international defense attorney Nick Kaufman observed that it may take months for the CCF to rule on such a petition adding that the review body \"doesn't have to give reasons for its decision and there is no right of appeal\"."]}, {"page": "Ayesha Gaddafi", "response": ["On 3 June 2012, through her lawyer Nick Kaufman, Ayesha Gaddafi also petitioned the judges of the International Criminal Court requesting that they order the Prosecutor - Fatou Bensouda to disclose what steps she had taken to investigate the murder of her father and brother Mutassim Gaddafi. This application was opposed by the Prosecutor who stated that requiring her to disclose the requested information would intrude on prosecutorial independence and discretion and potentially impede the investigation itself."]}, {"page": "Free Gaza Movement", "response": ["The family of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit offered the organizers of the flotilla full support provided that \"in addition to their demand that Israel lift its blockade they will urge Hamas to allow the soldier to receive letters and food packages from his family and allow international organizations to visit him\". According to Attorney Nick Kaufman, who approached the Free Gaza Movement on behalf of the kidnapped soldier's family the offer was refused. The group strongly denied this, saying they had always called for the release of all prisoners, including Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and that they had accepted Mr. Kaufman's request but had not heard back from him since."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalene College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Nick Kaufman, lawyer"]}]}}
