During the summer and throughout the season some of the most influential players of the previous campaign left Nene Park, including Lee Tomlin, Mark Byrne, Jamie Stuart, Andrew Lawton and Paul Terry. Because of these losses the Diamonds struggled to make a serious play-off push, and by mid-April were 10th in the table, some thirteen points off a promotion spot. Disappointing runs in the FA Cup, FA Trophy and Hillier Cup did little to consolidate the campaign."]}, {"page": "James Stuart", "response": ["* Jamie Stuart (born 1976), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Chris Beardsley", "response": ["Beardsley was signed by Conference Premier club York City on 19 June 2007, to provide competition for Richard Brodie, Craig Farrell and Onome Sodje. He made his debut as a starter in their 2\u20131 home defeat to Cambridge on 11 August 2007, in which he was substituted on 62 minutes. Despite struggling for a place in the team, Beardsley turned down a loan move to Conference North club Tamworth in September 2007, in order to prove his worth at York. He suffered a broken jaw in two places during York's 2\u20130 away win over Grays Athletic on 22 September 2007, after being elbowed by Jamie Stuart in an off-the-ball incident, which was likely to rule Beardsley out for at least three months. Essex Police confirmed they were making enquiries following the incident. Beardsley returned to the team as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 1\u20131 home draw with Crawley Town on 1 December 2007. He finished his York career with nine appearances."]}, {"page": "Stuart Elliott (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["Elliott signed for Conference Premier club Grays Athletic on 7 May 2008.

However, he scored a goal from 25\u00a0yards in the third match on 16 August 2008, which finished as a 2\u20131 home victory against Northwich Victoria. He picked up a hernia injury, which required him to undergo surgery in December 2008. He was transfer listed by the club in January 2009, with financial pressures and manager Wayne Burnett's plans cited as the reason. Following the departure of Burnett, Elliott took the role of assistant manager at Grays, alongside Jamie Stuart. He made his return from injury in a 2\u20131 home win over Altrincham on 7 March 2009.
