After the appointment of Tommy Burns he remained as reserve team manager until the end of the 1998\u201399 season, when Reading disbanded their reserve team. Nevertheless, he was promoted to manager of the club after a successful spell as caretaker in 1999. He turned the club around from relegation fighters to promotion candidates through players, such as Jamie Cureton, and his r\u00e9gime to increase the fitness of the squad."]}, {"page": "Walter Smith", "response": ["Smith was a close friend of former Celtic player and manager Tommy Burns.

However, Goram was allowed to remain at Rangers when he proved his fitness and commitment during pre-season training, and he returned as first-choice goalkeeper for season 1994\u201395. Goram continued to excel in goal for Rangers, with Celtic manager Tommy Burns lamenting in January 1996, \"If anyone gets round to doing my tombstone, it will have to read: Andy Goram Broke My Heart.\" Goram went on to win a further three league titles, a Scottish Cup and a Scottish League Cup in his time at Rangers."]}, {"page": "Linvoy Primus", "response": ["In the next season, Reading finished 10th and faced strong competition from new signing Elroy Kromheer, but Primus became disillusioned at the financial situation he was in.

Primus was promised an improved contract, however no such contract was given to him over the summer. By popular demand, manager Tommy Burns was replaced by Alan Pardew. Fitness problems prevented Primus from getting much first team football at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season until a change of diet helped him regain stamina.

Celtic had been eliminated from European competition after being unable to overcome a shock 0\u20135 first leg defeat to Artmedia Bratislava in the second qualifying round of the 2005\u201306 Champions League and also had an inauspicious start to the league season, needing an injury time equalizer from Craig Beattie just to draw with Motherwell in the league opener. For this reason, Strachan immediately inserted Nakamura into the match day lineup for the second league game of the season against Dundee United on 6 August, despite Nakamura not being match fit as he had not played since the Confederations Cup earlier in the summer. Nevertheless, Nakamura had an excellent debut and was named Man of the Match, earning a standing ovation from the home Celtic support when he was substituted in the 84th minute. Both Tommy Burns and Neil Lennon, at the time first-team coach and club captain, respectively, have credited Nakamura's arrival at Celtic with helping turn around Celtic's disappointing start to the season."]}, {"page": "Gary Gillespie", "response": ["Soon after the appointment of Tommy Burns as Celtic manager in 1994, it became apparent that Gillespie was not part of the new manager's plans. On 23 August 1994 he returned to Coventry City on a free transfer, making three Premier League appearances during the 1994\u201395 season. However, he played just three FA Premier League games before a knee injury struck him down, and he finally retired from playing in 1997 after more than two years out of action."]}]}}
