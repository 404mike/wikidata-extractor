Seymour took the kick, but shot straight at Howard Baker, after which the Times reporter felt the Professionals lost heart. Shortly afterwards, Ashton received a pass from Billy Bryant, dummied Cecil Poynton and hit a low drive past Hardy for his and the Amateurs' third goal. Macey chipped the ball over Hardy for the fourth, and after a passing move involving several players, Macey pulled the ball back to give Ashton a tap-in. Edgar Kail found Macey unmarked, and he \"got the last goal with both Spencer and Charlton trying to worry him off the ball [which] was typical of his work throughout.\" With five minutes left, a move down the right wing between Walsh and Charlie Hannaford led to the latter's consolation goal for the Professionals.", "|Wing half|| Billy Bryant||Millwall||"]}]}}
