There was of course sadness as seven players died fighting in the war.  These were goalkeeper Richard Herron, half-backs Henry Hargreaves and Stan Ripley and reserve team players George Limer, Jack Shorthouse, Tom Kinson and Bill Nixon.

It was hoped that the club was set from a bright future and, with virtually everyone retained who had acquitted themselves so well in the war period, promotion was the target. Two Scottish players George Jarvis (from Celtic) and Jock Stirling (from Bradford Park Avenue) joined the forward ranks, whilst goalkeeper Tom Kay became first choice keeper and would go on to make 70 successive appearances.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| George Jarvis"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| George Jarvis"]}, {"page": "George Jarvis", "response": ["George Jarvis may refer to:", "* George Jarvis (cricketer) (1800\u20131880), English cricketer", "* George Jarvis (footballer) (1889\u20131969), Scottish footballer", "* George Jarvis (Philhellene) (1797\u20131828), American Philhellene who took part in the Greek Revolution"]}]}}
