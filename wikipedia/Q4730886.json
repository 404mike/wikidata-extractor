Kerrigan wanted the film to be as realistic as possible in depicting young people's lives in contemporary Britain, as well as realistically portraying drug culture and club culture, both walks of life in which Kerrigan had experience. Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits, and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK gay lifestyle magazine Attitude, actor Danny Dyer spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 BBC television drama Loved Up (which also featured an early appearance from Lena Headey), and which had similar themes to the film.", "On 21 October 2002, distributors VCI announced the DVD release of Human Traffic Remixed, promising a \"modernised\" soundtrack with new contemporary (2002) tracks, previously cut scenes, and \"state-of-the-art CGI effects.\" On 18 October The Guardian revealed that rather than being a \"director's cut\", it was the work of producer Allan Niblo, Kerrigan's tutor and \"mentor\" at film school. Niblo removed from the titles all shots of the 1994 anti-Criminal Justice and Public Order Act demonstration and subsequent riot, thus eliminating the implicit political element of the original. He also cut the more anti-royalist second verse of the spoof national anthem, and all references to Moff, played by Dyer, being a casual drug dealer. Dyer went on to star in other Niblo produced films, notably The Football Factory. He added previously deleted scenes about Jip's internal struggles over his mother's prostitution, and another where the female leads play aliens, creating a film slightly less concerned with the politics and active promulgation of the Class-A Ecstasy & MDMA drug culture endemic in the 1990s, and more about coming of age struggles informed by a passive participation in it."]}, {"page": "26th Genie Awards", "response": ["* It's All Gone Pete Tong, Elizabeth Yake, Allan Niblo, James Richardson"]}, {"page": "Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture", "response": ["| Elizabeth Yake, Allan Niblo, James Richardson"]}, {"page": "Vertigo Films", "response": ["Vertigo Films was created in July 2002, by producers Allan Niblo (producer of Human Traffic and South West 9) and James Richardson (producer of Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)).", "|Noel Clarke, Ashley Walters, Nick Love, Allan Niblo "]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1997", "response": ["|Loop||Allan Niblo||Andy Serkis, Susannah York, Tony Selby||Romance/comedy||"]}, {"page": "Natasha Rhodes", "response": ["Rhodes was born in Kent, England in 1978.

Edwards did not storyboard or script the film but wrote a treatment of the story and outlines that detailed points that needed to be hit in dialogue. The filming equipment cost approximately $15,000 and the production budget came in \"way under\" $500,000. The film was able to be made on such a low budget largely due to the production using consumer grade prosumer level equipment instead of professional paraphernalia. The film was shot using digital video cameras rather than the more expensive 35 mm film and was edited on a laptop computer. Many of the locations in the film were used without permission and most of the extras were people who were already at the locations. As the extras were non-actors who were persuaded to be in the film, their actions were improvised."]}, {"page": "Horrid Henry: The Movie", "response": ["Horrid Henry: The Movie is a 2011 British 3D children's musical adventure comedy film, directed by Nick Moore and produced by Allan Niblo, Rupert Preston, Mike Watts and Lucinda Whiteley, who wrote it.
