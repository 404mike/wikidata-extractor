His brothers George Cooke and Henry Frederick Cooke were both later prominent army officers, as was his stepfather Edward Smith. He joined the Royal Navy at a young age and in 1790 was promoted to lieutenant, joining HMS Victory in 1793 for Mediterranean service under Lord Hood during the French Revolutionary Wars. In August 1793, Hood was approached by representatives of the French Royalist faction offering to surrender the powerful naval port city of Toulon in exchange for protection. Cooke was already familiar with the port and was selected as the British delegation to the authorities, entering the port surreptitiously as the approaches were patrolled by Republican supporters from the fleet at anchor. Cooke came under fire during his entry to the port and was under threat of execution, but successfully negotiated the complete surrender of the city and fleet to Lord Hood.Cooke, Edward, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J.
