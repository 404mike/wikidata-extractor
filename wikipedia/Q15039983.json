In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres \"accessory\" to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and it came to pass that these fibres were increasingly viewed as part of the vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term \"accessory nerve\" was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion."]}, {"page": "Richard Quain", "response": ["Quain was the eldest child of John Quain of Carraig Dh\u00fain (Carrigoon), Cork and Mary, daughter of Michael Burke of Mallow, Cork.

Lawrence was also an early supporter of the school, lecturing on surgery in 1826\u20137; but he withdrew after taking a position at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Lawrence was a reformer, and the background was his opposition to an 1824 regulation of the Royal College of Surgeons aiming to limit the number of medical schools that a surgical student could attend. He saw this measure as intended to force students into the hospital medical schools. Jones Quain taught anatomy alongside Lawrence; but he had to drop out following a dissection wound."]}, {"page": "List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin", "response": ["* Jones Quain (Classics, 1814), anatomist."]}]}}
