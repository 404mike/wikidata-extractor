Working in deprived districts of London, notably Deptford, and Bradford, she agitated for reforms to improve the health of young children, wrote several books on nursery education and pioneered a play-centred approach that has only latterly found wide acceptance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cottingley Fairies", "response": ["Early press coverage was \"mixed\", generally a combination of \"embarrassment and puzzlement\". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published a series of articles in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: \"And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them.\" The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; \"For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children.\" Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: \"How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed.\" The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: \"Look at Alice's [Frances'] face. Look at Iris's [Elsie's] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10\u00a0million faces and forms\u00a0\u2013 it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it.\""]}, {"page": "Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor", "response": ["During this period Nancy Astor continued to be active outside government, supporting the development and expansion of nursery schools for children's education. She was introduced to the issue by socialist  Margaret McMillan, who believed that her late sister helped guide her in life. Lady Astor was initially skeptical of this aspect, but later the two women became close; Astor used her wealth to aid their social efforts.Sykes (1984), pp. 329\u201330Masters (1981), p. 140"]}, {"page": "Early childhood education", "response": ["Davy states that the British Children's Act of 1989 links to play-work as the act works with play workers and sets the standards for the setting such as security, quality and staff ratios. Learning through play has been seen regularly in practice as the most versatile way a child can learn. Margaret McMillan (1860-1931) suggested that children should be given free school meals, fruit and milk, and plenty of exercise to keep them physically and emotionally healthy. Rudolf Steiner (1861\u20131925) believed that play time allows children to talk, socially interact, use their imagination and intellectual skills. Maria Montessori (1870\u20131952) believed that children learn through movement and their senses and after doing an activity using their senses. The benefits of being active for young children include physical benefits (healthy weight, bone strength, cardiovascular fitness), stress relief, improved social skills and improved sleep. When young students have group play time it also helps them to be more empathetic towards each other."]}, {"page": "Trees (poem)", "response": ["Trees were favorite symbols for Yeats, Frost, and even the young Pound.\u00a0... But Kilmer had been reading about trees in another context[,] the movement to stop child labor and set up nursery schools in slums.\u00a0... Margaret McMillan\u00a0... had the happy idea that a breath of fresh air and an intimate acquaintance with grass and trees were worth all the pencils and desks in the whole school system.\u00a0... The English word for gymnasium equipment is 'apparatus.'  And in her book Labour and Childhood (1907) you will find this sentence: 'Apparatus can be made by fools, but only God can make a tree.'Davenport, Guy. \"Trees\", in The Geography of the Imagination.

Godine, 1997), 177-179. ."]}, {"page": "Little Horton", "response": ["Bradford Council formed a school board which had the task of establishing \u2018board schools\u2019 to supplement the schools provided by the church authorities. School boards were elected by people in the local area. One of the elected members of the school board in Bradford was Margaret McMillan. Margaret McMillan was responsible for setting up a system that checked the health of children in the elementary schools, she was also instrumental in encouraging physical education to be included as part of the curriculum and in convincing the local school board to provide school meals for children in their care.  Margaret McMillan was committed to promoting the benefits of nursery education and established the first nurseries in the country in Bradford. She argued that the early years of a child\u2019s life were the most important in education. The Teacher Training College, situated in Little Horton on Trinity Road, was named in memory of this pioneer of education and is known as the Margaret McMillan Building."]}, {"page": "Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906", "response": ["Margaret McMillan and Fred Jowett were members of the School Board which introduced free school meals in Bradford. This was actually illegal and the School Board could have been forced to end this service. McMillan and Jowett tried to persuade Parliament to introduce legislation which encouraged all education authorities to provide free school meals for children. McMillan argued that if the state insists on compulsory education, it must take responsibility for the proper nourishment of school children. A report published in 1889 indicated that over 50,000 pupils in London alone were attending school \"in want of food\".  Other social studies, such as Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People of London, 1899-1903 and Seebohm Rowntree's Poverty: A Study of Town Life in York, 1901, found that nearly a third of the population and cities studied were living in poverty.  The 1904 Report into Physical Deterioration followed the large rejection of men from service in the Boer War, as they were malnourished."]}]}}
