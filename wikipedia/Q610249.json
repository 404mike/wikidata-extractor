He was spotted by  Jeff Barmby who tipped off  Everton reserve team manager Ray Henderson. As a product of the youth system at Everton, left-footer Heard made eleven appearances for the club.\nIn October 1979, the young midfielder was signed by Aston Villa at a valuation of \u00a3150,000 (2015: \u00a3680,000) in a deal which saw John Gidman move the other way. Heard made nine appearances in his first season at Villa Park but was not one of just 14 players used by Ron Saunders to become League champions in the following season. He scored a goal during a 4\u20133 defeat to Arsenal at Highbury  in March 1982 and scored the winner in a 0\u20131 victory away to local rivals, West Bromwich Albion in May that year.Pat Heard won a European Cup medal after being named as a substitute for the 1982 European Cup Final. Although he was not used during the match, the following European Cup season, Heard played for the defending champions in the 3\u20131 victory over Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K..Heard left Villa in January 1983 for Sheffield Wednesday priced at \u00a360,000; his new club's hopes of promotion from the Second Division had been dented by a recent slump in form. He was forced to take a taxi to Highbury, London for the 1983 FA Cup semi-final having been accidentally left behind by manager, Jack Charlton. However, when Jack Charlton moved to Newcastle United, Heard was the new manager's first signing. In October 1984 he scored in a 3\u20130 victory over Ipswich Town; his second goal came the following month in a 2\u20132 draw away to Luton.In August 1985, Heard moved to Middlesbrough on a month's loan with a view to a permanent deal. \nIn November 1985 he scored as Middlesbrough beat Shrewsbury Town 3\u20131 at home. Following his spell at Middlesbrough, in 1986 he joined his hometown club Hull City. Notable performances included scoring a penalty in the 2\u20131 victory over his old club, Villa, in August 1987. As penalty taker he also scored in a 3\u20130 away win at Barnsley in October 1987; and the 2\u20131 away win at Oldham Athletic in the Christmas fixtures that year.Having been a first teamer for two seasons at Hull, Heard left to play for Rotherham United, winning the Fourth Division title. This was followed by Cardiff City during which time he turned down an offer from Norwegian club Randaberg IL to become their player-manager. He returned briefly to Hull before continuing his career with the Brunei M-League Team. A clash of heads fractured his skull ending his playing career at the age of 34.\nAfter football, Heard embarked on a variety of careers including as a publican in both Hull and Chesterfield, a summariser for Free Radio Birmingham, a stage hypnotist. Most recently, as an Approved Driving Instructor, Heard taught Villa youngsters Barry Bannan, Benji Siegrist, and Andreas Weimann to drive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gidman", "response": ["Gidman played for the Liverpool youth team without ever playing for their first team, before he joined Aston Villa in 1971.
