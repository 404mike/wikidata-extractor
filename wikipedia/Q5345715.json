He married Selina Florence, daughter of Thomas Vesey Nugent, on 15 December 1864.\nVerner was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lisburn in 1863.  He contested a by-election in February of that year, and was narrowly defeated by the Liberal Party candidate, industrialist John Doherty Barbour. However, that result was overturned on petition and at a second by-election in June he won the seat by 151 votes to Barbour's 90.Verner held the Lisburn seat until 1873. His father William had been one of the two MPs for County Armagh, and on William's death Edward resigned his seat to stand in the by-election for Armagh.
