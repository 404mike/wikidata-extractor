In the Church of England, Graham Kings contrasts open evangelicals from \"conservative evangelicals\" and \"charismatic evangelicals\". Another Anglican, Martyn Percy, contends that such a position is quite tenuous and, on divisive issues, either stands firm to a form of uncritical conservatism or risks being attacked as theological liberalism.", "The think tank Fulcrum and the periodical Anvil were established as fora for open evangelicals within the Church of England. Prominent advocates of the open evangelical position include N.\u00a0T. Wright, Graham Kings, Steven Croft, and Justin Welby. Among Anglican theological colleges, open evangelicalism is particularly strong within Ridley Hall, Cambridge, Cranmer Hall, Durham, and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford.

The church then underwent extension work, after Rev. Richard Luther initiated a scheme to build a new section containing a lounge, kitchen, office, toilets and creche room. The plans were drawn up by K. C. White & Partners. As part of the scheme, a baptistry was also created, the church's pews were replaced by chairs and a new heating system was installed. The extension was dedicated on 21 January 1983 by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. John Kirkham. In 2010, planning permission was granted for the church hall to be replaced with a new facility. The \u00a31.8 million St Aldhelm's Church Centre was opened by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev.

In 1992, the mission theologian Graham Kings, who later became Bishop of Sherborne, was appointed as the inaugural lecturer in missiology in the Federation.  Under Kings' leadership the Henry Martyn Hall relocated its library to Westminster College, changed its name to the Henry Martyn Centre (HMC), and became formally affiliated with the Cambridge Theological Federation and the Cambridge University Faculty of Divinity. Following the Centre's initiative, the archives and library of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) moved from its offices in London to the Cambridge University Library in 1998. In 2014 the HMC became the Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide to reflect academic trends in the study of Christianity as a worldwide phenomenon. The CCCW library contains more than 10,000 books and over 100 journals related to the study of history and World Christianity. The library is associated with the Cambridge University Library (referred to as the University Library, or simply the UL). The holdings of the CCCW are registered with the National Archives of the United Kingdom and comprise materials related to the history of missions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The collection includes the papers of John Edward Church (1899-1989), a graduate of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a leader in the East African Revival.", "Graham Kings, who was appointed by the Henry Martyn Trust as missiology lecturer in 1992, served as the founding director of the Henry Martyn Centre from 1996 to 2000.

The following two years saw fundraising towards the restoration/rebuilding costs, and a faculty for the work was obtained in November 1963. The work was carried out in 1964 by R. G. Spiller of Chard to the designs of John Stark of the Dorchester architects Jackson and Stark. A new roof with a stainless steel bell spire was added, the existing walls were repaired and re-plastered internally, and new fittings were added. The church reopened with a re-dedication service carried out by the Archdeacon of Sherborne, the Right Rev. David Maddock, on 29 November 1964. The 50th anniversary of the church's reopening was celebrated with a thanksgiving service led by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. Graham Kings."]}]}}
