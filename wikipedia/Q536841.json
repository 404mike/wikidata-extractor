After recording a version of the song \"It's Magic\", and releasing the latter as her debut single, Rogers suggested \"The Wedding\" as its follow-up, since it was a song she remembered fondly from her time in Spain. The single was released in the UK in August 1964 and marked her first appearance on the UK Singles Chart, steadily climbing the chart until it spent two weeks at number three in October and November of that year. Around this time Rogers' recording was released in the U.S., and \"The Wedding\" reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and logged three weeks atop the Billboard Middle-Road Singles (adult contemporary) chart in January 1965. The song also reached the top of the Australian Kent Music Report and was a hit in other countries as well. In the mid-1970s, it was estimated that over seven million copies of the song had been sold, and for many years after its release, it was a popular selection at wedding ceremonies around the world.  The only controversy about the song was to have a Protestant woman sing a song about a Catholic wedding, especially with the use of the Latin words  of Franz Scubert's version of \"Ave Maria\".", "*Julie Rogers UK 7\" release info Discogs", "*Julie Rogers website", "Category:Julie Rogers songs"]}, {"page": "List of Billboard Easy Listening number ones of 1965", "response": ["On the first chart of 1965, the number one song was \"The Wedding\" by British singer Julie Rogers, which held the top spot for three weeks before being replaced by another British act, Chad & Jeremy, with their single \"Willow Weep for Me\".
