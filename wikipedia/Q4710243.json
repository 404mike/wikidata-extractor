He was born in Swansea and died in Cimla.\nFreethy played his debut Minor Counties match in 1908, though he would only occasionally play in the period immediately before the war, notching up seven Minor Counties appearances before 1914. Freethy returned to the Minor Counties arena during 1920, and in Glamorgan's debut first-class season of 1921, which turned out to be his last in the County game, picked up three first-class appearances.\nFollowing Freethy's retirement from cricket, he would further pursue his love of rugby, becoming one of the great rugby union referees of the period, taking charge of eighteen tests between 1923 and 1931. During the 1924-25 tour by the New Zealand Invincibles, he sent off Cyril Brownlie during the England-New Zealand test, the first time a player had been sent off from a test. Freethy  later served on Glamorgan's committee in the 1930s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Varsity Match", "response": ["There was not a referee until the 1881 match, when Mr H. H. Taylor officiated.  Prior to this each game had two umpires, one from each university. The record number of appearances is held by former RFU secretary Rowland Hill along with Welshman Gwynne Walters both with seven games. Other notable International referees who have controlled this fixture are Englishmen G. H. Harnett (6) Cyril Gadney (6) and H.L. Ashmore (5), along with Welshmen Albert Freethy (6) and Clive Norling (5).  Up until the start of the professional era, one of the unique aspects of the Varsity game was that the referee was not appointed by the RFU but agreed upon and invited by the two captains. This tradition ended after the 1997\u201398 season, along with that of the previous year's captains returning to act as touch judges (a continuation of the original custom of each university appointing an umpire), when the RFU Referees' committee decided that touch judges could only be qualified officials and that the RFU should appoint the referee. Now there is also a television match official."]}, {"page": "Rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Some of the French press even conceded that the fans had been unfair at the match. Still the odds were set at 5 to 1 against the US with a 20-point spread in the upcoming match with France. Two days later, the issue over the final's referee was settled when Albert Freethy of Wales was selected."]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "response": ["The Invincibles was a nickname given to the 1924\u201325 New Zealand national team which toured the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Canada.
