He commissioned Ernest H\u00e9brard for the work, which the architect conceived and developed with the aid of the Greek architects Aristotelis Zachos and Konstantinos Kitsikis, as well as British designer Thomas Hayton Mawson and fellow Frenchman Joseph Pleyber. The plan did away with the medieval and Ottoman street layout, imposing instead a plan of formal boulevards, in a symmetrical pattern about a central axis, carefully composed around the most important ancient Byzantine churches and mosques.
