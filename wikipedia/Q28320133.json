As part of this process, Budworth appointed Rachel Johnson as the magazine's ninth editor in September 2009. She took over from Arline Usden who became an editor at large.

Johnson's axing of The Lady Laughs, a cartoon series by Patricia Drennan that ran from 2000 to 2009, led to complaints by readers.
