He played as a forward.\nJones was born in Prescot, Lancashire. He began his football career with Bootle before joining Everton of the Football League First Division in 1905. He scored on his Everton debut, on 14 April 1906 in a 2\u20131 defeat of Derby County, but found his progress blocked by the prolific Sandy Young, and over the next four years Jones played only 14 more league games. He dropped down a division to join Birmingham in September 1910. He made a promising start to his first season with the club, and when Jack Hall arrived in December the pair formed a fine understanding. Injury disrupted Jones's 1911\u201312 season, in which he played only three times for the first team, and in 1912 he returned to Lancashire to join Southport Central.", "link_mentions": {}}}
