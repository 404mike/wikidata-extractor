He played as a forward.\nJones was born in Prescot, Lancashire. He began his football career with Bootle before joining Everton of the Football League First Division in 1905. He scored on his Everton debut, on 14 April 1906 in a 2\u20131 defeat of Derby County, but found his progress blocked by the prolific Sandy Young, and over the next four years Jones played only 14 more league games. He dropped down a division to join Birmingham in September 1910. He made a promising start to his first season with the club, and when Jack Hall arrived in December the pair formed a fine understanding. Injury disrupted Jones's 1911\u201312 season, in which he played only three times for the first team, and in 1912 he returned to Lancashire to join Southport Central.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Jones", "response": ["Thomas Jones may refer to:", "* Thomas Jones (civil servant) (1870\u20131955), British civil servant and educationalist", "* Thomas Jones (bishop) (c. 1550\u20131619), Anglican archbishop in Dublin", "* Thomas Jones (priest) (died 1682), defender of Anglican Christianity", "* Thomas Jones of Denbigh (1756\u20131820), Methodist clergyman, hymnwriter", "* Thomas Jones (missionary) (1810\u20131849), Christian missionary to the Khasi people, India", "* Thomas Jones (minister) (1819\u20131882), Welsh Independent preacher", "* Thomas Jones (justice) (1614\u20131692), British judge", "* Major Thomas Jones (died 1713), Irish-born immigrant to Long Island, USA", "* Thomas Jones, 7th Viscount Ranelagh (1812\u20131885), proponent of British volunteer force", "* Thomas Jones (Medal of Honor) (1820\u20131892), American Civil War sailor", "* Thomas Jones (MP for Wallingford), 15th-century Member of Parliament for Wallingford", "* Thomas Jones (died 1559), MP for Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire", "* Thomas Jones (MP for Hereford) (died 1628), MP for Hereford", "* Thomas Jones (died 1711), MP for East Grinstead", "* Thomas Jones (South Carolina mayor) (1742\u20131826), fifth intendent (mayor) of Charleston, South Carolina", "* Thomas Jones, Baron Maelor (1898\u20131984), British MP for Meirionnydd", "* Thomas Jones (mathematician) (1756\u20131807), British mathematician and academic", "* Thomas Jones (optician) (1775\u20131852), British astronomical instrument maker and Fellow of the Royal Society", "* Thomas Jones (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u2013?), outside left (Small Heath)", "* Thomas Jones (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131958), Welsh international football inside left (Nottingham Forest)", "* Thomas Jones (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), football centre forward and outside right (Everton, Birmingham City)", "* Thomas Jones (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u20131923), English football goalkeeper (Grimsby Town)", "* Thomas Jones (American football) (born 1978), American football player", "* Thomas Jones (rugby union) (1895\u20131933), Welsh international rugby union player", "* Thomas Jones (wrestler) (born 1982), British wrestler better known as \"The UK Kid\"", "* Thomas Jones (historian) (1732\u20131792), American Loyalist historian", "* Thomas Jones (artist) (1742\u20131803), landscape painter in Italy and Britain", "* Thomas Jones (English publisher) (1791\u20131882), publisher, bookseller in London, convert to Judaism", "* Thomas Jones (civil engineer) (1809\u20131892), South Australian pioneer", "* Thomas Jones (librarian) (1810\u20131875), librarian of Chetham's Library, Manchester, Britain", "* Thomas Jones (born 1980), American rapper, birth name of Rapper Big Pooh", "* Arrest of Thomas Jones, 2000 case involving the Philadelphia Police Department"]}, {"page": "Walter Freeman (footballer)", "response": ["Freeman began the 1909\u201310 season back in the reserves, scored a hat-trick against Arsenal Reserves in a South-Eastern League match, and was then transferred to another Second Division club, Birmingham, against whom he had scored twice the previous season.
