Appeasement, says historian Martin Thomas was not a coherent diplomatic strategy or a copying of the British.

Thomas further noted that at the same time that Alg\u00e9rienne was a bestseller, another book about the Algerian War, namely Services sp\u00e9ciaux Alg\u00e9rie 1955-1957 by General Paul Aussaresses, was an even bigger bestseller in France. Thomas also noted that Services sp\u00e9ciaux Alg\u00e9rie 1955-1957 was translated into English as The Battle of the Casbah: Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism in Algeria, 1955-1957 while Alg\u00e9rienne still awaits its translation. He argues many people even today in the West still attach greater value to the lives of Westerners over non-Westerners, which explains why a book by a Frenchman describing and justifying torture as a legitimate counter-terrorism tactic in the Battle of Algiers attracts more attention and better sales than does a book by an Algerian woman describing her experiences of the said torture that Aussaresses ordered."]}, {"page": "Constantine Plan", "response": ["Historian Martin Thomas adopted a critical outlook on the plan. Although the plan was meant to be a transformative development scheme, Thomas believed that the execution of the Constantine Plan was doomed to fail due to sheer financial issues arising from France ramping up costly military operations such as its nuclear program. In regard to domestic reaction, Algerian socialists believed the plan was proof that de Gaulle shared similar values referring to public infrastructure projects, state-funded employment, and public housing. Others believed the plan as a whole to be a misguided economic solution to a program that was primarily political. Dorothy Pickles, in her book Algeria and France From Colonialism to Cooperation, argues that even if the Constantine Plan had accomplished all that it had set out to do it still would not have been enough to meet all of Algeria's growing needs and fully develop it to a level equal to Europe, as Charles de Gaulle claimed. For Pickles, the goals set about by the plan would have no doubt eased France's plan for the creation of a new French Algeria, \u201cbut they [were] only the beginning of the beginning\u201d."]}]}}
