He stated that this anger was not aimed at \"the press\" who he saw as being \"held up so easily as scapegoats\" but rather it was directed at \"certain people in the profession\" who he claimed to have taken advantage of her: \"There were a lot of timid souls who dared not, who forced Sarah to dare on their behalf. She enacted their fantasies of outrage for them. There is always one child in the class who will do the things others fear to. That is what marks them out, their courage, and their will.

Fraser has been hailed by director Dominic Dromgoole as \"the early prophet, the John the Baptist of the brutalist school that flourished in the mid-nineties. A lot of tricks that tired by the end of the Nineties, the rimming, the sadism, the antibodies, the sexual frankness, the cool irony in the face of outrage, began with Fraser\". Brown also developed \"Scottish work with Scottish actors\" such as the \"provocative\" 1992 play The Life of Stuff written by \"local actor\" Simon Donald.

Its legend grew and grew until it became the pivotal influence on the generation of playwrights that followed. It is a foundation text; it separates then from now.\" Sierz goes on to write that the play \"introduced a totally new sensibility into British theatre [that] signalled a fresh direction for contemporary playwrighting: one that eschewed realistic naturalism, political ideology and social commentary, and turned auditorium's into cauldron's of sensation\", adding that the play was \"an agenda setting work: the era of experiential theatre began here.\" The artistic director of the Bush Theatre, Dominic Dromgoole, wrote that The Pitchfork Disney \"was one of the first plays to signal a new direction for new writing.
