He has been capped three times by the Scotland national team.\nRiordan started his career with Hibernian in 2001 and had a brief spell on loan with Cowdenbeath in 2003. He became one of the top young players in the Scottish Premier League, winning the young player of the year awards in 2005. Riordan signed for Celtic in 2006, but failed to hold down a regular first-team place and returned to Hibernian in 2008. He totalled 104 goals in 260 appearances across all competitions in his two spells at Easter Road.Riordan left Hibs as a free agent in 2011 and signed for Chinese Super League club Shaanxi Baorong Chanba, but the two-year contract was mutually terminated after just four months. He then signed for St Johnstone on a short term contract in March 2012. Riordan then signed for Bristol Rovers, but he was released after a three-month deal.

These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2\u20130 to Livingston. Williamson departed near the end of that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray.

UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993.

A win against St Johnstone in Williamson's first match in charge effectively removed the danger of relegation. Due to financial problems at the club, Williamson had to move on several senior players, but he did not endear himself to the Hibs fans. He lightheartedly joked about this relationship by referring to himself as a \"weegie hun\".

Six days later, Mandari\u0107 confirmed an interest in striker Derek Riordan, who was lacking first team football at Celtic.
