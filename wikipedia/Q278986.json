O. L. Atkin, was a British mathematician.\nAs an undergraduate during World War II, Atkin worked at Bletchley Park cracking German codes. He received his Ph.D. in 1952 from the University of Cambridge, where he was one of John Littlewood's research students. During 1964\u20131970, he worked at the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton, computing modular functions. Toward the end of his life, he was Professor Emeritus of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nAtkin, along with Noam Elkies, extended Schoof's algorithm to create the Schoof\u2013Elkies\u2013Atkin algorithm. Together with Daniel J. Bernstein, he developed the sieve of Atkin.\nAtkin is also known for his work on properties of the integer partition function and the monster module. He was a vocal fan of using computers in mathematics, so long as the end goal was theoretical advance: \"Each new generation of machines makes feasible a whole new range of computations; provided mathematicians pursue these rather than merely break old records for old sports, computation will have a significant part to play in the development of mathematics.\"\nAtkin died of nosocomial pneumonia on 28 December 2008, in Maywood, Illinois.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Partition function (number theory)", "response": ["Since 5, 7, and 11 are consecutive primes, one might think that there would be an analogous congruence for the next prime 13, p(13k + a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} for some a.

Compared with the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, which marks off multiples of  primes, the sieve of Atkin does some preliminary work and then marks off multiples of squares of primes, thus achieving a better theoretical asymptotic complexity.

Atkin, devised improvements to Schoof's basic algorithm by restricting the set of primes S =  \\{l_1, \\ldots, l_s\\} considered before to primes of a certain kind. These came to be called Elkies primes and Atkin primes respectively. A prime l is called an Elkies prime if the characteristic equation: \\phi^2-t\\phi+ q = 0 splits over \\mathbb{F}_l, while an Atkin prime is a prime that is not an Elkies prime. Atkin showed how to combine information obtained from the Atkin primes with the information obtained from Elkies primes to produce an efficient algorithm, which came to be known as the Schoof\u2013Elkies\u2013Atkin algorithm. The first problem to address is to determine whether a given prime is Elkies or Atkin. In order to do so, we make use of modular polynomials, which come from the study of modular forms and an interpretation of elliptic curves over the complex numbers as lattices. Once we have determined which case we are in, instead of using division polynomials, we are able to work with a polynomial that has lower degree than the corresponding division polynomial: O(l) rather than O(l^2).  For efficient implementation, probabilistic root-finding algorithms are used, which makes this a Las Vegas algorithm rather than a deterministic algorithm."]}, {"page": "Primality certificate", "response": ["To address the problem of efficient certificate generation for larger numbers, in 1986 Shafi Goldwasser and Joe Kilian described a new type of certificate based on the theory of elliptic curves.Goldwasser, S. and Kilian, J. \"Almost All Primes Can Be Quickly Certified\".
