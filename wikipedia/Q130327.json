The civil war that took place in Banten left behind the instability for the next government, due to dissatisfaction of the VOC's interference in the Bantenese affairs.  The people's resistance peaked again at the end of the reign of Sultan Abul Fathi Muhammad Syifa Zainul Arifin, including the resistance of Ratu Bagus Buang and Kyai Tapa. As a result of the prolonged conflict the Sultan of Banten again sought the help of the VOC in reducing some of the people's resistance so that since 1752 Banten had become a vassal state of the VOC.Atsushi Ota, (2006), Changes of regime and social dynamics in West Java: society, state, and the outer world of Banten, 1750\u20131830, BRILL, .In 1808, at the peak of the Napoleonic Wars, Herman Willem Daendels, Governor General of the Dutch East Indies, ordered the construction of the Great Post Road to defend Java from the British attack. Daendels ordered the Sultan of Banten to move his capital to Anyer and provide labor to build a port planned to be built in Ujung Kulon.

Nevertheless, local Javanese people did not forget Majapahit completely, as Mojopait is mentioned vaguely in Babad Tanah Jawi, a Javanese chronicle composed in the 18th century. Majapahit did produce physical evidence: the main ruins dating from the Majapahit period are clustered in the Trowulan area, which was the royal capital of the kingdom. The Trowulan archaeological site was first documented in the 19th century by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Lieutenant-Governor of British Java of the East India Company from 1811 to 1816. He reported the existence of \"ruins of temples.... scattered about the country for many miles\", and referred to Trowulan as \"this pride of Java\"."]}]}}
