She spent her early years in Liverpool. Her family encouraged her to concentrate on social issues; the family motto was \"What ought to be done, can be done.\" Rathbone went to Kensington High School (now Kensington Prep School), London; and later went to Somerville College, Oxford, over the protests of her mother, and supported by Classics coaching from Lucy Mary Silcox. She studied with tutors outside of Somerville, which at that time did not yet have a Classics tutor, taking Roman History with Henry Francis Pelham, Moral Philosophy with Edward Caird, and Greek History with Reginald Macan. Some of these classes were taken together with Barbara Bradby, a lifelong friend. Rathbone was devoted to her studies, taking little part in the entertainments available to female students such as games, and engaging in limited socialising with male students. Her handwriting was reportedly so poor that she had to dictate her final exam papers to a typist, and she received a result in the Second class. In 1894 she was one of the seven founding members of the \"Associated Prigs\". This was the unofficial name of the discussion group that met on Sundays evenings. The first meeting was in Edith Marvin's room. They never agreed a name or leader but the group would keep notes and the links established were valuable after they left Somerville. Another founder members was Mildred Pope and other early members were Margery Fry and Hilda Oakeley."]}, {"page": "Saint Felix School", "response": ["By September 1902, the present site of the school had been purchased and the first four boarding houses and teaching block completed.

Johnstone was the illegitimate daughter of the musician Nora Brownsford and the artist Augustus John. Her mother gave her daughter the allusive surname of Johnstone from a tutor at Alderney and raised her with a distance relationship with her father in Norwich and London. Johnstone was resented by her half-sisters and was ridiculed by society for being an illegitimate child. She was educated at the Saint Felix School in Southwold, where she saw the paintings of Christopher Wood and other modernists of the era, which were purchased by Lucy Mary Silcox, the school's headteacher."]}]}}
