Wright served as Dowding's personal assistant during the Battle. In his book Dowding and the Battle of Britain (1969) Wright was one of the early proponents of the Big Wing conspiracy theory that blamed Trafford Leigh-Mallory and the British Air Ministry for Dowding's removal from command at the end of the battle. Many of Wright's claims, some based on Dowding's faulty recollections, have been repudiated by witnesses and documentary evidence, but his allegations have proven popular and persistent over the years.\nPrior to becoming a champion of Dowding, Wright co-wrote the biography of Dowding's rival and replacement at Fighter Command, Sholto Douglas in two volumes titled: Years of Combat and Years of Command (1966).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Wright", "response": ["*Sir Robert Wright (judge, died 1689) (c. 1634\u20131689), Lord Chief Justice of England, 1687\u20131688", "*Robert Wright (Chief Justice of South Carolina) (1666\u20131739), Chief Justice of South Carolina from 1725", "*Robert Wright, Baron Wright (1869\u20131964), British law lord", "*Robert Wright (English cricketer) (1852\u20131891), English first-class cricketer", "*Robert Wright (English footballer) (1880\u2013?), English footballer", "*Robert Wright (Australian cricketer) (1914\u20131965), Australian cricketer", "*Robert Wright (British historian) (1906\u20131992), Royal Air Force historian and biographer of Hugh Dowding", "*Robert Wright, Canadian historian known for writing the book and documentary film Our Man in Tehran", "*Sir Robert Wright (surgeon) (1915\u20131981), British surgeon", "*Robert Wright (musical writer) (1914\u20132005), American composer and lyricist of musicals", "*Robert Wright (Maryland politician) (1752\u20131826), Governor of Maryland", "*Robert Wright (New Zealand politician) (1863\u20131947), MP and mayor of Wellington", "*Robert Wright (Calvinist priest) (1556\u20131624), English Anglican priest", "*Robert Wright (English bishop) (1560\u20131643), Bishop of Bristol, 1623\u20131632, and Bishop of Lichfield, 1632\u20131643", "*J.
