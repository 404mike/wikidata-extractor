Despite heroic active service and steadfast administration and diplomatic service, Wager can be criticized for his failure to deal with an acute manning problem. However, in reality the Royal Navy's numerical preponderance over other navies was greater than at any other time in the century, and its dockyard facilities, overseas bases (Wager was much involved in the development of new bases in the Caribbean), victualling organization, and central co-ordination were by far the most elaborate and advanced. Although British warship design was inferior to French in some respects, the real problem was an insufficiency of the versatile and seaworthy 60-gun ships, a class that Wager's Admiralty had chosen to augment during the 1730s but, as wartime experience would show, not aggressively enough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1708", "response": ["* June 8 \u2013 War of Spanish Succession: Wager's Action, a naval confrontation, takes place between a British squadron under Charles Wager and the Spanish treasure fleet."]}, {"page": "Looe", "response": ["The constituencies of East Looe and West Looe were incorporated as parliamentary boroughs in 1571 and 1553 respectively, surviving as rotten boroughs with each returning two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the unreformed House of Commons until the Great Reform Act of 1832.
