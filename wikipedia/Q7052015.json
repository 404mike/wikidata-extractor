The title has several possible interpretations: victory, versus, verse, etc. Proposals to screen a filmed version of 'v.' by Channel 4 in October 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press, some broadsheet journalists, and MPs, apparently concerned about the effects its \"torrents of obscene language\" and \"streams of four-letter filth\" would have on the nation's youth. Indeed, an Early Day Motion entitled \"Television Obscenity\" was proposed on 27 October 1987 by a group of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), who condemned Channel 4 and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The motion was opposed only by MP Norman Buchan, who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem. The broadcast went ahead and, after widespread press coverage, the uproar subsided. Gerald Howarth MP said that Harrison was \"Probably another bolshie poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us\".
