With his partner John Gaff Gillespie developed an attenuated high-rise style for the office buildings of the fin de siecle cities.One of his most famous buildings is the category-A listed \"The Hatrack\" (1899\u20131902) in St Vincent Street, a heavily glass-fronted Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style) tower, remarkable in execution for its day. This building was only recently rescued from demolition.\nSalmon was born in Glasgow, the son of architect William Forrest Salmon (1843\u20131911) and Jessie Alexander, and grandson of architect James Salmon (1805\u20131888). He was educated at Glasgow High School from 1883 to 1888, when he joined the architecture practice his grandfather had established in 1830. James senior had died that year, leaving William in charge. James junior attended classes at Glasgow School of Art from 1888 until 1895, and completed his apprenticeship in the office of William Leiper (1839\u20131916). On completion of his articles he undertook a grand tour, taking in France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Greece and Spain.\nSome works include:\n\nRowantreehill in Kilmacolm (1898) (tudor, art nouveau)\nchauffeur's house in Gallowshill (1903)\nMiyanoshta in Kilmacolm (1905) (romantic, art nouveau)\nLion Chambers in Glasgow (1905)\nDen o' Gryffe (c.1903) (art nouveau)\nHazelhope in Kilmacolm (c.1900) (tudor, art nouveau)\nNorthernhay in Kilmacolm (1906) (modernism)\nNether Knockbuckle in Kilmacolm (c.1910)In 1895 Salmon rejoined the family firm, where John Gaff Gillespie (1870\u20131926) was now a partner. He worked on designs for the Mercantile Chambers in Bothwell Street, and was himself made a partner in 1898.  In that same year he designed his first villa for his father. In November 1903 the firm was renamed Salmon Son & Gillespie.  He continued to undertake study tours to Europe, and was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1906. Salmon's designs were largely in the Glasgow Style of art nouveau, influenced by the sculptors he had met at Glasgow School of Art, and by the architecture of the arts and crafts movement. In 1904-5 Salmon was responsible for the Lion Chambers on Hope Street, an early example of reinforced concrete construction.\nWilliam Forrest Salmon died in 1911, leaving his share of the partnership to his second wife Agnes, James Salmon's stepmother. Gillespie bought out Agnes' interest, becoming senior partner, and later taking on William Kidd (1879\u20131929) to form the basis of the modernist practice Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. Salmon left the practice in 1913, retaining a commission for the Admiralty Village at Greenock, and setting up on his own as James Salmon & Son. When the First World War broke out, this connection brought further commissions, although he had little other work after the split. After the war, he concentrated on domestic and hospital work. In 1923 he retired due to bowel cancer, and died the following April.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Art Nouveau", "response": ["File:St Vincent Chambers - view from S.jpg|\"The Hatrack\" building by James Salmon, 142a, 144 St. Vincent Street, Glasgow (1899-1902)"]}, {"page": "Blythswood Hill", "response": ["*Mercantile Chambers (1900)  by James Salmon 35-69 Bothwell Street  "]}, {"page": "Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style)", "response": ["James Salmon (architect, born 1873) native of Glasgow who attended Glasgow School of Art from 1888 until 1895, and completed his apprenticeship in the office of William Leiper (1839\u20131916) had unique opus as well. \"The Hatrack\" (1899\u20131902) in St Vincent Street is his most famous work, with plenty of glass, highly detailed Modern Style facade and distinctive cupola that gave buildings its nickname."]}, {"page": "James Salmon", "response": ["James Salmon may refer to:", "*James Salmon (architect, born 1805) (1805\u20131888), Scottish architect", "*James Salmon (architect, born 1873) (1873\u20131924), his grandson, also a Scottish architect", "*James Salmon (cricketer) (1849-1903), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "James Salmon (1873-1924)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Salmon (architect, born 1873)"]}, {"page": "List of Category A listed buildings in Glasgow", "response": ["The architectural character of Glasgow has been described as follows: \u201c[t]he architecture of the City Centre exhibits a distinctive confidence from the late 18th century into the 21st century that makes it unique in Scotland. Although a variety of architectural styles exist, there are certain Glasgow characteristics: depth of modelling; wealth of ornamentation and sculpture; animated roofline; and consistent building lines and predominantly flat (not stepped or curved) linear elevations along the backs of the pavements. Glasgow architects and engineers were, and remain, frequent pioneers of new building technology and materials.\u201dGlasgow Central Conservation Area Appraisal, City Design Group, Development & Regeneration Services, Glasgow City Council, 2012, p.23 Perhaps the most striking quality of Glasgow\u2019s urban form is the eclectic mix of styles which it exhibits. Of those belonging to the early nineteenth century include: the neoclassicism of William Stark and David Hamilton; a vigorous tradition of Greek Revival, possibly the longest lasting in Britain, which persisted down to the 1890s;See Gomme, Walker, 1968, pp.153-167 Italianate evidenced in the Western Club and Rochead\u2019s 2 St Vincent St.; and Gothic Revival notably practised by Leiper and G. Gilbert Scott. By the mid-century Glasgow had produced its first native architect of national and later international importance in Alexander Thomson, whose eclectic historicism produced its own school. Later nineteenth-century work includes the art nouveau inspired buildings of James Salmon, particularly the \u201cHatrack\u201d on St Vincent St.; the Beaux arts style common to many public buildings of the period especially the City Chambers; Mackintosh\u2019s art and crafts inflected work; Edwardian Baroque revival; and the distinctive free Glasgow Style of Millar and the later Salmon. The inter-war period sees the use of Art Deco and some reference to the Chicago Style in the elevator buildings demanded by commerce of the time, specifically in James Miller\u2019s St Vincent St. Bank of Scotland and 98 West George Street. Post-war there is the creative application of Functionalism in the work of Jack Coia and Brutalism elsewhere in the city\u2019s redevelopment. The best of Glasgow's historic architecture was metropolitan in its ambition, as the Buildings of Scotland remarks: \u201cA visitor with time to spare will find that the city centre is rich with remarkable buildings from the height of its industrial prosperity and that its grandest suburbs are planned on a scale comparable with many European capitals.\u201dWilliamson et al., 1990, p.11"]}, {"page": "James Salmon (1873\u20131924)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Salmon (architect, born 1873)"]}, {"page": "Lion Chambers", "response": ["The Lion Chambers was originally designed by James Salmon and John Gaff Gillespie, who together formed the partnership known as Salmon, Son & Gillespie. The two were commissioned by William George Black who was a lawyer and writer based in Glasgow. Black was a well-established within the Glasgow Art Club, which included some well-known artists such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler.Cusack, Patricia. \"Lion Chambers: A Glasgow Experiment.\u201d Architectural History, vol. 28, 1985, pp. 198\u2013211. www.jstor.org/stable/1568532. Because of this he integrated into has plans artist's studios that would be located in the top floors of the building. The Glasgow City Council was known to have somewhat of a soft spot for the innovative club in which Black was part of, so it is thought that this may have been of some help in getting the building approved for construction. The building was home to many lawyers and artists for most of the 20th century, until the main bulk of the building had to be evacuated in 1995 due to the decision that it was too dangerous to regularly use. The ground floor and basement were still used up until 2009 when it was decided that they too should be evacuated. The building remains there to this day with no clear indication of its future \u2013 The sum needed to repair the building back to safe conditions is far too great for the multiple co-owners to afford, and no one else has showed enough interest to invest in it.Brebbia, C.A. & Hernandez, S. (2015). Structural Studies, Repairs and Maintenance of HERITAGE ARCHITECTURE XIV, p. 559. Lightening Source, UK.  The building has been threatened for demolition since 1991 when the co-owners were served with a \"Dangerous Building Notice\",Derelict Glasgow. http://www.derelictglasgow.co.uk/derelict.lionchambers.html . Retrieved 8 November 2016. but the threats fell through because the building is listed as a Category A building in 1966.Rainnie, Andrew John. http://www.discoverglasgow.org/victorian-lion-chambers/4578200741. Retrieved 8 November 2016 In April 1991, water-pooling, cracking and spalling affect the building due to its structural decay. The co-owners decide to pursue demolition, since the repairs are estimated at \u00a31\u20131.5 million. Four years later, The Scotsman reports that due to the danger of collapsing, all the occupants have been evacuated. Building Control has been assessed to the building. On 12 April 1995, The Independent reports that the owners of Lion Chambers have been served with a Dangerous Building Notice, after which they submit a demolition application. A month later, The Herald reports that for only 20 more years life of the building, the repairs cost at around \u00a31.5 million. A report by Glasgow Building Preservation Trust has been submitted to Glasgow City Council, proposing a longer term but expensive approach to repairs. On 29 August 1995 the permission to demolish has been refused, giving the owners 6 more months to deal with the Dangerous Building Notice, the press reports. They discuss with the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust about undertaking repairs, and also want to hear of other parties wishing to take on the building. In October 1997, Glasgow Building Preservation Trust reports that they want to develop a centre for young designers, including workshop and training spaces, called Centre for Product Resource Innovation and Design Enterprise (PRIDE). In 1999, \u00a35,000 has been granted for a feasibility study, as reported by The Annual Report of the Architectural Heritage Fund. The study says that re-using as dwellings and workshop space is viable. Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council have agreed that more research is required into the building's mode of construction."]}]}}
