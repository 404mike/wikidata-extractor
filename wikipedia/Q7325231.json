The album was the first time its executive producer Richard Dodd worked in country music. A majority of the songs were written by Cook and songwriter Hardie McGehee, who shared a music publisher. Prior to Hey Y'all, Cook had independently released her debut studio album The Blue Album (2000) and performed over 100 times at the Grand Ole Opry. She signed a deal with Atlantic Records, but was later transferred to Warner Bros. after AOL-Time Warner closed Atlantic's Nashville office. Hey Y'all was Cook's debut on a major record label.", "After the critical acclaim of The Blue Album, Atlantic Records approached Cook with a record deal. Subsequently, Hey Y'all was recorded at Javeline Studios, the Hum Depot, and Vital Recording in Nashville, Tennessee, and Sound Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee; the recording process started in the spring of 2001. When asked about her approach for the album, Cook said she wanted to create a sound that balanced her artistic integrity with commercial appeal. For its production, she approached Richard Dodd, although he had never worked on a country album; she picked Dodd to avoid the \"obvious go-to guys\", believing the style at the time was \"a little tired\", to have a more individualized sound. Along with being the album's executive producer, Dodd produced all of its songs. For the album's recording, he had people play instruments in one studio so the sounds would blend together. According to The Tennessean's Craig Havighurst, it was an atypical recording technique for a major record label.", "Hey Y'all received a positive response from critics.; ; . In Country Weekly, Cook was named one of the top ten \"brightest stars\" of 2002. Several reviewers enjoyed the album's traditional country sound, such as Phyllis Stark who believed Cook's \"distinctive drawl and hardcore country delivery\" pulled the album together. Calling Cook \"delightfully\" country, Paulette Flowers applauded her choice to release \"genuine Grade-A country\" music. Country Standard Time's Clarissa Sansone praised Hey Y'all as referencing the \"prairie-skirt heyday of Dolly and Emmylou\" instead of attempting to be crossover music like Shania Twain and Faith Hill. Larry Aydlette said although Cook initially looked like an attempt to mimic Twain, she is set apart by her \"healthy respect for serious country music\" as shown by her choice to cover \"I'm Not Lisa\" and include Bill Anderson on \"Don't Bother Me\". While describing Cook's voice as having a \"Dolly Parton sweetness\", Patrick Langston commended her for being able to convey more emotions than Twain. Jim Patterson wrote that Richard Dodd's production helped to elevate Hey Y'all from being just \"the perfect-yet-boring Nashville norm\".", "* Richard Dodd \u2013 string arrangements"]}, {"page": "Fucking Smilers", "response": ["*Richard Dodd, Alan Matthews, John Krovaza \u2013 cellos"]}, {"page": "Azalea Place", "response": ["\"After my first solo album I went out to the States to work with Richard Dodd - who's this English guy living out in Nashville \u2013 on the second one, which kept me away from home for a long time,\" Tempest said in an interview, \"But it was something that I needed to do, I had to get it out of my system.\"", "# \"If I'd Only Known\" \u2013 3:54 (Joey Tempest, Steve Diamond, Richard Dodd)", "*Richard Dodd - Producer, engineer, arrangements"]}, {"page": "Don't Do Anything", "response": ["** Richard Dodd \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "2 (Darker My Love album)", "response": ["** Richard Dodd \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "Sparks of Ancient Light", "response": ["* Richard Dodd - Cello"]}, {"page": "Welcome to the Woods", "response": ["** Richard Dodd - cello"]}, {"page": "Civilians (Joe Henry album)", "response": ["* The Section Quartet on \"Our Song\": Eric Gorfain \u2013 first violin; Daphne Chen \u2013 second violin; Leah Katz \u2013 viola; Richard Dodd \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "The Psychomodo", "response": ["* Richard Dodd \u2013 engineer (Nova Sound)"]}]}}
