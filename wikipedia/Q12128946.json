His father, John William Pritchard, was a Detective Chief Superintendent and who made his career as an investigating officer on the Great Train Robbery in 1963.He attended Halford Road Primary school, Fulham, St Clement Danes Grammar School, Ducane Road, Hammersmith from 1969\u20131975 and Robinson College, Cambridge from 1983 to 1986, where he read law. Whilst at Cambridge, he was President of the Hawks' Club, succeeding Rob Andrew, the England Rugby player.In 1980 he was a crew member of the British eight which won the Olympic silver medal. In 1981, he won a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships in Munich. He finished fifth with the British eight in the 1984 Olympics.He coached the Oxford University Boat Club in 1980 and 1981, and the Cambridge University Boat Club in 1982 and 1983. He rowed in The Boat Race three times for Cambridge against Oxford. In the 1984 race, the crew in which he rowed famously hit a barge moored above Putney Bridge resulting in the much-broadcast image of a sinking boat. The win in the 1986 race was the only Cambridge win in a run of 17 wins for Oxford. By winning in 1986, Cambridge denied Oxford winning the Ladbrokes trophy outright, having won for the previous nine years.Pritchard founded and runs an executive search business, Piper Pritchard Associates, in London. He was a director of the British Olympic Association and is Chairman of Right To Play, an international charity which supports children in war-torn and deprived parts of the world through sport. He is Chairman of the Hawks' Club. He is also chairman of the steering committee and deputy chairman of the alumni advisory board of Cambridge University.In 2014, he rowed the length of the Mississippi river in a traditional Thames racing skiff. The 2,320 mile journey took three months and raised over $1,000,000 for Right to Play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robinson College, Cambridge", "response": ["*John Pritchard, Olympic and World rowing medallist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*John Pritchard (Robinson), British Olympic silver medallist (1980)"]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Duncan McDougallAllan WhitwellHenry ClayChris MahoneyAndrew JusticeJohn PritchardMalcolm McGowanRichard StanhopeColin Moynihan (cox)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Henry Clay, Andrew Justice, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, Colin Moynihan, John Pritchard, Richard Stanhope, and Allan Whitwell \u2014 Rowing, Men's Eights", "* Henry Clay, Andrew Justice, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, John Pritchard, Richard Stanhope, Allan Whitwell, Colin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Clive Roberts, Adam Clift, Salih Hassan, Chris Mahoney, Duncan McDougall, Malcolm McGowan, John Pritchard, Allan Whitwell, Colin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "Hawks' Club", "response": ["*John Pritchard Olympic silver medallist, Blue Boat 1984, 1985, 1986"]}, {"page": "Robinson College Boat Club", "response": ["John Pritchard, represented Cambridge in the boat race and won silver in the Men's VIII at the 1980 Olympics"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in rowing (men)", "response": ["|Duncan McDougallAllan WhitwellHenry ClayChris MahoneyAndrew JusticeJohn PritchardMalcolm McGowanRichard StanhopeColin Moynihan"]}, {"page": "John Pritchard", "response": ["John Pritchard may refer to:", "*John Pritchard (basketball) (1927\u20132012), American professional basketball player", "*John Pritchard (bishop) (born 1948), Anglican Bishop of Oxford", "*John Pritchard (Canadian politician) (1861\u20131941), Progressive party member of the Canadian House of Commons", "*John Pritchard (conductor) (1918\u20131989), British conductor", "*John Pritchard (footballer) (born 1995), English footballer", "*John Pritchard (rower) (born 1957), British rower who competed in the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics", "*John Pritchard (MP) (1797\u20131891), British Member of Parliament for Bridgnorth", "*John Pritchard (singer)"]}, {"page": "1981 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["|   Mark Andrews (b)John Bland (2)Colin Seymour (3)Christopher Mahoney (4)Andrew Justice (5)John Pritchard (6)Malcolm McGowan (7)Richard Stanhope (s)Colin Moynihan (c) || 6:04.31"]}, {"page": "The Boat Race 1985", "response": ["Cambridge stroke John Pritchard said \"I tried everything.
