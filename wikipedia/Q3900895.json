He spent four years as reserve goalkeeper at Anfield, without making a first-team appearance. There were no substitute goalkeepers in domestic football in those days, and so McDonnell's only first-team squad involvement came in European football.\nHe was on the bench  for the 1977 European Cup Final, a game which Liverpool won. However, McDonnell's winner's medal was lost after the game, believed by some to have been stolen and given to one of Liverpool's first-team players who had missed the final. Following the arrival of Steve Ogrizovic, he was pushed down to third choice, and left to join Oldham Athletic in 1978.\nHe spent four years there, before heading to Dallas in the NASL, then to Hong Kong to play for Hong Kong Rangers, eventually returning home to represent a number of non-league clubs. He spent some time at Barrow in the Northern Premier League, and later the Football Conference and won the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in 1990.\nMcDonnell is currently a referee in the North Lancashire and District Football League and is a Westmorland Football Association council member.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barrow A.F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "MacDonnell (surname)", "response": ["* Peter McDonnell (born 1953), English professional football player"]}, {"page": "1977 European Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||12||\u00a0Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winning players", "response": ["|Peter McDonnell||||Liverpool||1||1977 ||"]}, {"page": "Peter mcdonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter McDonnell "]}, {"page": "1976 UEFA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||13 || Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||13 || Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1977 European Super Cup", "response": ["|GK ||16 || Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||16 || Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1974 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|GK ||17|| Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1977 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|GK ||16|| Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||16|| Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||16 || Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||16 || Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1976 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|GK || || Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||13|| Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||13 || Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||13 || Peter McDonnell"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["*  Peter McDonnell", "|GK || || Peter McDonnell", "|GK ||12|| Peter McDonnell"]}]}}
