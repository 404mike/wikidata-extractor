That evening, Jack tries to drown his sorrows in Irish poit\u00edn, when he has an encounter with an invisible leprechaun. They struggle for the bottle of poit\u00edn, and Jack falls, knocking himself unconscious. The next morning, he sees the little man again and chases him to a nearby river, where the leprechaun falls in. Jack jumps in after him, saving his life (because water is the only thing that can kill the immortal leprechauns), then Seamus Muldoon (Colm Meaney), the saved leprechaun, becomes Jack's new friend.
