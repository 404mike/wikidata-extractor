In 1993, he joined Woking, and two years later signed for Gillingham of the Football League Third Division for a transfer fee of \u00a35,000. He made 31 appearances for the Kent-based club, scoring three goals, before moving to Barnet in September 1996 for a fee of \u00a315,000.

Three new signings were announced at the same time as Scally's takeover and the appointment of Pulis: forward Leo Fortune-West joined from non-League club Stevenage Borough for a transfer fee of \u00a35,000, which was donated by Gillingham's official supporters' club from funds collected earlier in the year as part of its efforts to save the club, goalkeeper Jim Stannard was signed from Fulham, and Kevin Rattray arrived from non-League club Woking.  Subsequent signings included midfielder Mark O'Connor, who had previously played for the club between 1989 and 1993; he had played under Pulis's management at Bournemouth.  Midfielder Dave Martin joined from Bristol City on a free transfer and was immediately installed as the new club captain.  Simon Ratcliffe joined from Brentford, and shortly before the first match of the season, Mark Harris and Dominic Naylor arrived from Swansea City and Plymouth Argyle respectively.  The team prepared for the new season with a number of friendly matches, including one against Premier League club Chelsea, who sent a full-strength team including high-profile new signings  Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes.  The match drew a crowd of over 10,000, with many more turned away, and provided a significant funding boost for the club.  Gillingham adopted a new first-choice kit featuring blue and black striped shirts; the second-choice shirts, to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition, were red and black.  The team were forced to wear the previous season's kit for the first four games, however, as the suppliers of the new kit failed to deliver it on time."]}]}}
