He has written books on W. C. Fields, The Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, Laurel and Hardy, Mae West, Cecil B. DeMille, Mack Sennett and Charlie Chaplin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlie Chaplin", "response": ["Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film. There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, A Night Out, and his third, The Champion. The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace. Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its \"mean, crude, and brutish\" nature. The character became more gentle and romantic; The Tramp (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development. The use of pathos was developed further with The Bank, in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work. At Essanay, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, Chaplin \"found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world\".", "Chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags.A round-table Chaplin Interview  in 1952, first broadcast on BBC Radio on 15 October 1952. (In Norwegian) From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.", "The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history; according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown. The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the \"unique\" and \"indelible\" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his \"worldwide impact\". Praising the character, Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most \"eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit\" in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction."]}, {"page": "Cecil B. DeMille", "response": ["Cecil B. DeMille began his career as an actor on the stage in the theatrical company of Charles Frohman in 1900. He debuted as an actor on February 21, 1900, in the play Hearts Are Trumps at New York's Garden Theater.;  In 1901, DeMille starred in productions of A Repentance, To Have and to Hold, and Are You a Mason? At the age of twenty-one, Cecil B. DeMille married Constance Adams on August 16, 1902 at Adams's father's home in East Orange, New Jersey. The wedding party was small. Beatrice deMille's family was not in attendance, and Simon Louvish suggests that this was to conceal DeMille's partial Jewish heritage. Adams was 29 years old at the time of their marriage, eight years older than DeMille. They had met in a theater in Washington D.C. while they were both acting in Hearts Are Trumps.", "His first film from his new production company, DeMille Pictures Corporation, was The Road to Yesterday in 1925. He directed and produced four films on his own, working with Producers Distributing Corporation because he found front office supervision too restricting. Aside from The King of Kings (which was said to be DeMille's favorite film), none of DeMille's films away from Paramount were successful. The King of Kings established DeMille as \"master of the grandiose and of biblical sagas\". The most successful Christian film of the silent era. DeMille calculated that the film had been viewed over 800\u00a0million times around the world. After the release of DeMille's The Godless Girl, silent films in America became obsolete and DeMille was forced to shoot a shoddy final reel with the new sound production technique. Although this final reel looked so different from the previous eleven reels that it appeared to be from another movie, according to Simon Louvish, the film is one of DeMille's strangest and most \"DeMillean\" film.", "DeMille's films contained many similar themes throughout his career. However, the films of his silent era were often thematically different from the films of his sound era. His silent era films often included the \"battle of the sexes\" theme due to the era of women's suffrage and the enlarging role of women in society. Moreover, before his religious-themed films, many of his silent era films revolved around \"husband-and-wife-divorce-and-remarry satires\", considerably more adult-themed. According to Simon Louvish, these films reflected DeMille's inner thoughts and opinions about marriage and human sexuality. Religion was a theme that DeMille returned to throughout his career. Of his seventy films, five revolved around stories of the Bible and the New Testament; however many others, while not direct retellings of Biblical stories, had themes of faith and religious fanaticism in films such as The Crusades and The Road to Yesterday. Western and frontier American were also themes that DeMille returned to throughout his career. His first several films were westerns and he produced a chain of westerns during the sound era. Instead of portraying the danger and anarchy of the West, he portrayed the opportunity and redemption found in Western America. Another common theme in DeMille's films is the reversal of fortune and the portrayal of the rich and the poor, including the war of the classes and man versus society conflicts such as in The Golden Chance and The Cheat. In relation to his own interests and sexual preferences, sadomasochism was a minor theme present in some of his films. Another minor characteristic of DeMille's films include train crashes which can be found in several of his films.", "Despite his box-office success, awards, and artistic achievements, DeMille has been dismissed and ignored by critics both during his life and posthumously. He consistently was criticized for producing shallow films without talent or artistic care. Compared to other directors, few film scholars have taken the time to academically analyze his films and style. During the French New Wave, critics began to categorize certain filmmakers as auteurs such as Howard Hawks, John Ford, and Raoul Walsh. DeMille was omitted from the list, thought to be too unsophisticated and antiquated to be considered an auteur. However, Simon Louvish wrote \"he was the complete master and auteur of his films\" and Anton Kozlovic called him the \"unsung American auteur\". Andrew Sarris, a leading proponent of the auteur theory, ranked DeMille highly as an auteur in the \"Far Side of Paradise\", just below the \"Pantheon\". Sarris added that despite the influence of styles of contemporary directors throughout his career, DeMille's style remained unchanged. Robert Birchard wrote one could argue auteurship of DeMille on the basis that DeMille's thematic and visual style remained consistent throughout his career. However, Birchard acknowledged that Sarris's point was more likely that DeMille's style was behind the development of film as an art form. Meanwhile, Sumiko Higashi sees DeMille as \"not only a figure who was shaped and influenced by the forces of his era but as a filmmaker who left his own signature on the culture industry.\" The critic Camille Paglia has called The Ten Commandments one of the ten greatest films of all time.240px|thumb|DeMille directing, 1920|alt=DeMille on a stand, holding a megaphone, giving commands to crew members which surround him and several film cameras"]}, {"page": "Marx Brothers", "response": ["The Marx Brothers also had an older 'sister'\u2014actually a cousin, born in January 1885\u2014who had been adopted by Minnie and Frenchie.

C. Fields", "response": ["In the sound era, Fields appeared in thirteen feature films for Paramount Pictures, beginning with Million Dollar Legs in 1932. In that year he also was featured in a sequence in the anthology film If I Had a Million. In 1932 and 1933, Fields made four short subjects for comedy pioneer Mack Sennett, distributed through Paramount Pictures. These shorts, adapted with few alterations from Fields's stage routines and written entirely by himself, were described by Simon Louvish as \"the 'essence' of Fields\".Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W. C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 340\u2013341. The first of them, The Dentist, is unusual in that Fields portrays an entirely unsympathetic character: he cheats at golf, assaults his caddy, and treats his patients with unbridled callousness. William K. Everson says that the cruelty of this comedy made it \"hardly less funny\", but that \"Fields must have known that The Dentist presented a serious flaw for a comedy image that was intended to endure\", and showed a somewhat warmer persona in his subsequent Sennett shorts.Everson, William K. The Art of W. C. Fields. 1967, New York: Bonanza Books. p. 85. Nevertheless, the popular success of his next release, International House in 1933, established him as a major star.Louvish, Simon.

For example, he copyrighted his original stage sketch \"An Episode at the Dentist's\" three times: in January 1919 and twice again in 1928, in July and August.Gehring, Wes D. (2010). \"W. C.

Taylor and Francis Publishers, Oxfordshire, England, U.K. Retrieved August 6, 2019. Later, 13 years after its first copyright registration, that same sketch continued to serve Fields as a framework for developing his already noted short The Dentist. He also copyrighted his 1928 sketch \"Stolen Bonds\", which in 1933 was translated into scenes for his two-reel \"black comedy\" The Fatal Glass of Beer. Other examples of Fields's stage-to-film use of his copyrighted material is the previously discussed 1918 Follies sketch \"An Episode on the Links\" and its recycling in both his 1930 short The Golf Specialist and in his feature You're Telling Me! in 1934. \"The Sleeping Porch\" sketch that reappears as an extended segment in It's a Gift was copyrighted as well by Fields in 1928. A few more of his copyrighted creations include \"An Episode of Lawn Tennis\" (1918), \"The Mountain Sweep Steaks\" (1919), \"The Pullman Sleeper\" (1921), \"Ten Thousand People Killed\" (1925), and \"The Midget Car\" (1930).Louvish (U.S., 1997), p. 207.
