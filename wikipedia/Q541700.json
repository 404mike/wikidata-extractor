Born to a noble British family, he served in the Royal Navy, seeing action at the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of New Orleans. In 1819 he was discharged from the Royal Navy, and a few years later would travel to Greece to aid the Greeks in their struggle for independence, where he would take part in multiple battles, most notably the Battle of Itea, during which his ship the Karteria, would become the first steam-powered warship to see combat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of naval battles", "response": ["* 1827 September 29 \u2013 \"Greeks\" (Frank Abney Hastings) vs Turks in Salona Bay"]}, {"page": "Battle of Navarino", "response": ["But the Ottomans soon violated these undertakings.

Church's army lay siege to the Ottoman-held port of Patras, while Cochrane organised a revolt behind Ottoman lines in Epirus. By sea, Frank Abney Hastings, a former British naval officer now serving with the Greeks, used a steam-powered warship, the , to launch a daring night raid on 29/30 September at Itea on the northern shore of the gulf, sinking nine Ottoman gunboats. The problem for Codrington was that these officers were acting on their own initiative, largely ignoring the often contradictory directives of their employer, the Greek provisional government. Recognising that appeals to the latter were ineffective, Codrington despatched aides directly to the British commanders to demand that they cease operations, but with little result.Woodhouse (1965) 82\u201383"]}, {"page": "Ashby-de-la-Zouch", "response": ["*Frank Abney Hastings (1794\u20131828), British naval officer and Philhellene"]}, {"page": "Greek War of Independence", "response": ["On 7 February 1825, a second loan to Greece was floated in the City of London.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 289. Although the Greek government had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some \u00a31.1\u00a0million (~$404 million in 2021).Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pp. 289-290. Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to use the money to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 290. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pp. 290-291. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to overpower the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 291. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pp. 291-292. The two loans from the City caused significant financial difficulties for the young nation, and in 1878 a deal was struck between the creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth \u00a310\u00a0million, with unpaid interest down to 1.5 million pounds sterling.Brewer, David The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 p. 295."]}, {"page": "Sloop-of-war", "response": ["* In 1826, , acting as a warship of the Navy of the 1st Hellenic Republic under the command of Capt Frank Abney Hastings, was the first steam warship to see action.

On 8 April 1827, the Greek fleet, under the command of the British philhellene Frank Abney Hastings, captured five Ottoman ships in the city's harbour and forced the local garrison to evacuate the fortress. The provisional government of Greece claimed Volos as part of Greek national territory, but the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary along a line running south from Arta to Volos. Volos was incorporated into the Greek Kingdom in November 1881 with the rest of Thessaly."]}, {"page": "Steam frigate", "response": ["The first small vessel that can be considered a steam warship was the Demologos, which was launched in 1815 for the United States Navy.
