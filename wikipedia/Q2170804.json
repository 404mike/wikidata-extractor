Leeds won the First Division during his time at the club but he only contributed 4 appearances during the campaign. He then played in the North American Soccer League for Philadelphia Atoms and Washington Diplomats before returning to non-league football in England with Mossley, where he scored twice in 83 appearances, and Gainsborough Trinity, where he was manager. He then ran a pub and worked in his daughter's fitness centre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Roy Ellam"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Looking for a successor to Jack Charlton, early in the 1972\u201373 season he signed Gordon McQueen from St Mirren for \u00a330,000.

Leeds again came close to a Treble, but their league title campaign tailed off and they finished third, some seven points behind champions Liverpool. They did reach the 1973 FA Cup Final to face Second Division Sunderland, but despite manager turned pundit Brian Clough's remark that \"there is no way Sunderland can beat Leeds\", United lost 1\u20130. Leeds also reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup against Italian club A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium, where they were beaten 1\u20130 following some controversial refereeing from Christos Michas which eventually saw Norman Hunter sent-off after he reacted badly to being consistently fouled by pushing Gianni Rivera to the ground.
