During the First World War he served in France and Italy and was awarded the Military Medal. He began his football career in junior football in the Black Country area before joining Birmingham in April 1922. He made his debut in the First Division on 28 April 1923, in the penultimate game of the 1922\u201323 season, playing at inside left in a 1\u20130 win at home to Burnley. He kept his place for the last game of the season, and for the first six games of the next, but the arrival of Ernie Islip and the form and fitness of Johnny Crosbie and Joe Bradford restricted his first-team opportunities. He spent the 1924\u201325 season with Derby County, but was unable to break into the league side, and returned to non-league football with successively Wellington Town and Worcester City.His performances for Worcester, for whom he scored 34 goals in all competitions in the 1926\u201327 season, earned him a return to the Football League with Walsall of the Third Division South. Lane repaid them with 36 goals in all competitions in his first season, One more season at Walsall brought his goals tally up to 51 league goals from 57 appearances, and he finished off his career back in non-league with Brierley Hill Alliance, Netherton and Dudley Town.Lane died in Cannock, Staffordshire, in 1949 at the age of 54.", "link_mentions": {}}}
