During the First World War he served in France and Italy and was awarded the Military Medal. He began his football career in junior football in the Black Country area before joining Birmingham in April 1922. He made his debut in the First Division on 28 April 1923, in the penultimate game of the 1922\u201323 season, playing at inside left in a 1\u20130 win at home to Burnley. He kept his place for the last game of the season, and for the first six games of the next, but the arrival of Ernie Islip and the form and fitness of Johnny Crosbie and Joe Bradford restricted his first-team opportunities. He spent the 1924\u201325 season with Derby County, but was unable to break into the league side, and returned to non-league football with successively Wellington Town and Worcester City.His performances for Worcester, for whom he scored 34 goals in all competitions in the 1926\u201327 season, earned him a return to the Football League with Walsall of the Third Division South. Lane repaid them with 36 goals in all competitions in his first season, One more season at Walsall brought his goals tally up to 51 league goals from 57 appearances, and he finished off his career back in non-league with Brierley Hill Alliance, Netherton and Dudley Town.Lane died in Cannock, Staffordshire, in 1949 at the age of 54.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walsall F.C.", "response": ["*  Moses Lane (55) "]}, {"page": "List of Walsall F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Moses Lane", "|Moses Lane"]}, {"page": "Alf Oakes", "response": ["In June 1923, Oakes turned professional with Third Division South club Millwall. He made his Football League debut on 8 September 1923 in a 1\u20131 draw away to Aberdare Athletic, and scored his first goal at that level in a 2\u20130 win in the reverse fixture the following week. He made four more league appearances, and scored his second goal in October 1924 against Reading, who signed him at the end of that season. He never appeared for their league side, and trials with Rhyl Athletic and Wellington Town preceded a few months at Worcester City, where he played alongside former Birmingham forward Moses Lane. In February 1927, Birmingham paid a fee of \u00a3300 for Oakes' services, but he played only once for their first team, shortly after joining the club, as deputy for Joe Bradford. At the end of the 1927\u201328 season Oakes returned to Rhyl Athletic. A year later he made a more successful return to the Football League, scoring 15 goals from 54 games for New Brighton in the Third Division North."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Torrance", "response": ["He moved to Walsall in July 1926, and replaced David Ashworth as manager for the 1927\u201328 campaign.

Torrance played forty league and cup games for \"Saddlers\", but the club only avoided applying for re-election by two points, and he left Fellows Park at the end of the season."]}]}}
