He does most of the voices in his animations himself, and several feature himself in live action, including \"Haricots Verts\", \"Chutney\", \"Boogie\", \"CAMRA\", \"Stockmarket\", \"We Are Mature\", \"Tangerine\" the Weebl and Bob episodes \"DJ\" and \"Safety\", the fourth On The Moon episode, and \"Jazzmas\". He has also worked with other animators on YouTube, such as Edd Gould in the video \"Nuts [Weebl]\".\nPicking is a trained sound engineer and artist, and has also worked on 3D visual effects for the film Resident Evil. In 2003, he made several advertisements for Anchor Butter in the style of his Weebl and Bob animations, but featuring cows, which were broadcast in the UK. The television program Totally Viral on UKTV G2, consisting of video clips and cartoons from the internet, has an animated title sequence and links made by Jonti. Jonti set up his own production company called Sumo Dojo, which he later left to set up Weebl's Stuff Limited, also known as Weebl Ltd. Weebl's Stuff Ltd was dissolved in 2014, and Jelly Penguin Productions Ltd was set up in its place shortly afterward.\nIn 2009, Picking produced several radio and television adverts based on the tune of the first \"Magical Trevor\" for the 118 24 7 service of Yell.com. It appeared on the ITV television channel, amongst others. It was voted 6th Most Irritating Ad of 2009 by Marketing Magazine. He is also an admitted fan of Wesley Willis and created an animation for Willis' song \"Merry Christmas\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1975", "response": ["** Jonti Picking, British animator, voice actor and internet personality"]}, {"page": "MT", "response": ["* Magical Trevor, a cartoon by Jonti Picking"]}, {"page": "Weebl and Bob", "response": ["The Everyday Happenings of Weebl (and Sometimes Weebl's Friend Bob) (best known as Weebl and Bob, and renamed Wobbl and Bob for its DVD release) is a Flash cartoon series created by Jonti Picking (Weebl) and co-scripted by Chris Vick (Skoo).", "Along with the normal episodes of Weebl and Bob, a few special feature episodes have been created by Weebl and Skoo in which Bob narrates a story.

The animation features a strange, knife-wielding maniac with ginger hair and beard who uses sharp weaponry to help him in his everyday life. All toons are accompanied by ironic soothing music.", "; Chutney:The animation Chutney is a somewhat haphazard Weebl toon, which starts with a skydiver leaping from an airplane proclaiming \"Urine!\" A fellow skydiver pulls alongside and corrects him, saying \"I think you mean 'wee!'\". The first skydiver argues that he \"is a big boy now\" right before they land on a cloud. The cloud reveals a face and says \"BOOM!\" in a high-pitched voice. The second skydiver pokes his head above the cloud and into viewing range. \"Did this cloud just speak?\" he inquires, mere moments before the cloud detonates, killing both men. The cartoon continues with an English lord-like character and a stereotypical Frenchman called Passepartout on board a hot air balloon that descends into the frame. (this is possibly a reference to a scene in the 1956 film Around the World in 80 Days) The English character says \"Look at them, they're all dead!\" and proceeds to laugh to the point of breathlessness at the skydivers' misfortune. He catches his breath and requests that the Frenchman give him some more tea. The Frenchman tells him that they have run out, and the angry Englishman expresses his disgust with the Frenchman. The Frenchman \"judo kicks\" the Englishman at his rude remark. He is ejected from the hot air balloon to the Frenchman's angry cry of \"That is for ABBA!\", implying that the band are English. Although the Englishman is falling to his death, he swiftly and calmly replies, \"They were Swedish!\" The Frenchman rolls up his sleeves and journeys to Sweden to fight because of his hatred of the pop group, and is told to join a queue. The animation cuts to two more characters waiting in a line. One queries if this is the line for fighting, and the other (looking above news newspaper entitled \"poo\") replies, \"No, this is the line for chutney!\" The song of the animation begins and we hear of how chutney is a tasty addition to papadums or one's main course. The main chorus involves chants of \"Chutney!\" with large spinning heads - Jonti Picking's own - acting as background singers. Early in the song, we see the Englishman from the hot air balloon finally fall to the ground, where he is later taken away by an ambulance."]}, {"page": "Weebl's stuff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonti Picking"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Picking", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonti Picking"]}, {"page": "Bumeyes", "response": ["#redirect Jonti Picking"]}, {"page": "List of animators", "response": ["* Jonti Picking"]}, {"page": "Weebls stuff", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonti Picking"]}]}}
