After 1710 he became the pastor of a local group of Baptists. His father had been one of a group who brought the well-known Puritan John Flavel to Dartmouth. Later one of Newcomen's business contacts in London, Edward Wallin, was another Baptist minister who had connections with the well-known Doctor John Gill of Horsleydown, Southwark.   Newcomen's connection with the Baptist church at Bromsgrove materially aided the spread of his steam engine, as the engineers Jonathan Hornblower Sr. and his son were involved in the same church."]}, {"page": "17th century in literature", "response": ["* 1627 \u2013 John Flavel", "* 1691 \u2013 Richard Baxter; John Flavel"]}, {"page": "1691 in literature", "response": ["*June 26 \u2013 John Flavel, English Presbyterian religious writer (born 1627)"]}, {"page": "1627 in literature", "response": ["**John Flavel, English religious writer and Presbyterian minister (died 1691)"]}, {"page": "Divine providence", "response": ["* The Mystery of Providence by John Flavel, \u2014a Puritan classic on the subject"]}, {"page": "First Great Awakening", "response": ["Tennent was followed in the summer of 1741 by itinerant minister James Davenport, who proved to be more controversial than either Tennent or Whitefield. His rants and attacks against \"unconverted\" ministers inspired much opposition, and he was arrested in Connecticut for violating a law against itinerant preaching. At his trial, he was found mentally ill and deported to Long Island. Soon after, he arrived in Boston and resumed his fanatical preaching only to once again be declared insane and expelled. The last of Davenport's radical episodes took place in March 1743 in New London when he ordered his followers to burn wigs, cloaks, rings and other vanities. He also ordered the burning of books by religious authors such as John Flavel and Increase Mather. Following the intervention of two pro-revival \"New Light\" ministers, Davenport's mental state apparently improved, and he published a retraction of his earlier excesses."]}, {"page": "William Gurnall", "response": ["Gurnall is known by his Christian in Complete Armour, published in three volumes, dated 1655, 1658 and 1662. It consists of sermons or lectures delivered by the author in the course of his regular ministry, in a consecutive course on Ephesians 6: 10\u201320. It is described as a magazine whence the Christian is furnished with spiritual arms for the battle, helped on with his armour, and taught the use of his weapon; together with the happy issue of the whole war. It is thus considered a classic on spiritual warfare. The work is more practical than theological; and its style and its fervent religious tone continued to render it still popular with some readers. Richard Baxter and John Flavel both thought highly of the book. Toplady used to make copious extracts from it in his common-place book. John Newton, the converted slave trader, said that if he were confined to one book beside the Bible, he'd choose Christian Armour. Richard Cecil spent many of the last days of his life in reading it, and repeatedly expressed his admiration of it. Charles Haddon Spurgeon commented that Gurnall's work is \"peerless and priceless; every line full of wisdom. The book has been preached over scores of times and is, in our judgment, the best thought-breeder in all our library.\" In 1988 Banner of Truth Trust published a revised and abridged version in contemporary English."]}, {"page": "List of Puritans", "response": ["*John Flavel"]}, {"page": "Great Ejection", "response": ["The Act of Uniformity prescribed that any minister who refused to conform to the Book of Common Prayer by St Bartholomew's Day (24 August) 1662 should be ejected from the Church of England.

Oliver Heywood estimated the number of ministers ejected at 2,500. This group included Richard Baxter, Edmund Calamy the Elder, Simeon Ashe, Thomas Case, John Flavel, William Jenkyn, Joseph Caryl, Thomas Brooks, Thomas Manton, William Sclater, Thomas Doolittle and Thomas Watson.
