Godwin's influence can be detected in the Arts and Crafts Movement.\nHis best known early works include The Guild Hall, Northampton (illustration, right), which was his first notable public commission, and Congleton Town Hall, as well as restorations and neo-Gothic additions to Dromore Castle, Limerick and Castle Ashby.", "link_mentions": {}}}
