On 18 August, Eardley made his debut for the \"Seasiders\" in a 0\u20130 draw with Derby County at Bloomfield Road. He and teammate Charlie Adam were named in the Championship Team of the Week following their performance in the 3\u20132 home victory over Watford on 23 January 2010. However he was disciplined by Holloway the following month, along with Barry Bannan and Ishmel Demontagnac, when they were seen out at a nightclub in Blackpool following a home defeat to Leicester City, even though Eardley had a knee problem and was due to undergo treatment the next day. Holloway explained: \"I'm disappointedwe'll have a party once we've got 52 points\". All three were dropped from the squad for the next game, away to Sheffield Wednesday. The 2009\u201310 season ended on a high note though as Blackpool far exceeded their 52 points target to instead qualify for the play-offs with 70 points; they went on to beat Cardiff City 3\u20132 in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, though Eardley was not in the matchday squad."]}, {"page": "Mark Bradley (footballer, born 1988)", "response": ["Bradley made his first appearance of the 2007\u201308 season, coming against Leyton Orient on 18 August 2007 as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss.

However, Bradley's performance received criticism from Walsall's supporters for his inconsistency, causing manager Richard Money to respond, pleading them to be patient with the player. Bradley scored his first career goal for the club, in 3\u20132 victory at Doncaster Rovers on 2 October 2007. This was followed up by scoring his second goal for Walsall, in a 4\u20130 victory at Huddersfield Town. Following this, his performance was praised by then captain Tommy Mooney, saying: \"Bradders has got a chance of being a top player. You just hope he will continue to keep his head down and impress and while he is in the team people are looking at him. At the moment he needs to impress our manager and if he does that it makes it hard to drop him from the team.\" After missing two matches due to international commitment, Bradley scored his third goal for the club and set up a goal for Ishmel Demontagnac, in a 2\u20130 victory at Northampton Town on 24 November 2007.
