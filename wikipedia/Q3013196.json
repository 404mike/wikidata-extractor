Equally at home at wing or full back and instantly recognisable by his blond hair, he played in the first Churchill Cup in 2003. He also played in his second successive Churchill Cup in June 2004 as part of the England side which lost out in the final to New Zealand M\u0101ori after going into extra time following a draw on the full-time whistle.He was considered an outside candidate to be part of Clive Woodward's ultimately victorious 2003 Rugby World Cup winning squad. However, he was overlooked in the end, despite getting his first cap against Wales in one of England's warm up games prior to the World Cup, and being in the wider 43-man squad.Scarbrough has also been capped for England in the Sevens, playing in four IRB World tournaments, most notably winning the Hong Kong Sevens Tournament with England in 2004.\nHe moved from Leeds Tykes to Saracens in 2004, making his debut against Wasps in 4/9/04.\nScarbrough was blighted by injuries after his first cap but flew out to South Africa to join the pre World Cup squad in 2007, four years after his 1st full cap. He had been pulled across from England Saxons' Barclays Churchill Cup squad after David Strettle fell ill with a virus. The Saracens flier started on the wing at Loftus Versfeld and scored England's only try in the 55\u201322 defeat. He also infamously put a huge tackle on Percy Montgomery during that game. -[1]\nJoining Saracens from Leeds Tykes in 2004, Scarbrough further established himself as a potent attacking weapon, leading the try scoring for the 2005/06 season.\nA series of injuries in particular, a shoulder reconstruction, reduced his first team appearances to just eight in that first season. He played 40 times for the Men in Black the next season at both wing and full back and was beginning to show the form that made him one of Leeds Tykes most prolific try scorers.\nIn January 2009 under Eddie Jones, following a long-term knee injury, it was announced that he had left the club by mutual consent. and signed for the big hitting and spending French side Racing M\u00e9tro. After 3 solid years in the Top 14 Scarbrough began playing and coaching at Lille Metropole Rugby Club in 2012 in their bid for promotion to the French Pro d2.\nFollowing his playing career Scarbrough has now begun a new career as coach and teacher; currently Head of Rugby at Bradford Grammar School and formerly Queen Ethelburga's with his old Leeds Tykes teammate Rob Rawlinson.\nNow a Level 3 rugby coach, he has coached internationally and took Latvia rugby sevens team to the European Trophy in Croatia and Lithuania, beating Lithuania national team for the first time Ever and finishing 3rd.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baildon", "response": ["England rugby player Dan Scarbrough currently resides in Baildon.
