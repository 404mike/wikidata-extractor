Cowell was engaged to make-up artist Mezhgan Hussainy from 2010 to 2011. In 2013, Cowell allegedly began dating an American woman named Lauren Silverman. In July 2013, Silverman's husband and Cowell's friend, Andrew Silverman, filed for an at-fault divorce, citing adultery by his wife and naming Cowell as a co-respondent. News of the divorce filing became public two weeks later, when it was widely reported that Silverman and Cowell were expecting a baby together. Cowell said, \"There are a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here.\" The Silvermans released separate statements expressing concern for the well-being of their son during the divorce process. In August 2013, the Silvermans settled their divorce out of court, enabling Cowell to avoid being called as a witness in the divorce proceedings. He subsequently confirmed that Silverman was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to their son, Eric, on 14 February 2014. The couple confirmed their engagement in January 2022."]}, {"page": "24 Hour Party People", "response": ["* Terri Seymour as herself, reprising her co-host gig on Wheel of Fortune"]}, {"page": "Terri", "response": ["*Terri Seymour, a British television presenter"]}, {"page": "Extra (American TV program)", "response": ["* Terri Seymour \u2013 special correspondent (2004\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Wheel of Fortune (franchise)", "response": ["|Angela Ekaette (1988)Carol Smillie (1989\u201394)Jenny Powell (1995\u20132001)Terri Seymour (2001)"]}, {"page": "Seymour (surname)", "response": ["*Terri Seymour (born 1973), British television presenter and sometime actress"]}, {"page": "Wheel of Fortune (British game show)", "response": ["| 13 || 2 January 2001 || 4 August 2001 || 125 || rowspan=\"2\" | Terri Seymour"]}, {"page": "In the Beginning (miniseries)", "response": ["* Terri Seymour as Eve"]}, {"page": "List of The Young and the Restless characters (2011)", "response": ["| December 7 || Reporter || Terri Seymour || Actor is correspondent for the nationally syndicated television show Extra. || "]}, {"page": "Paul Hendy", "response": ["In 2001, he took over from John Leslie as host of ITV1's game show Wheel of Fortune  with Terri Seymour and ITV1's prime time Saturday night show Don't Try This at Home with Davina McCall, which ran for four series (1998\u20132001).
