The LP featured an eclectic mix of Manzanera, Quiet Sun and Eno originals, alongside distinctive cover versions of two well-known tracks, The Beatles' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and The Kinks' \"You Really Got Me\". The album also broke new ground in live concert recording, being one of the first live LPs to use the \"direct injection\" (DI) method of recording, in which the signals from the various electric instruments were fed directly into the recording console, enabling a dramatic improvement in fidelity over the earlier method of placing microphones near the various instrument amplifiers.", "While his 1990 solo album Southern Cross was an album of Latin music, Manzanera started in 1999 a series of solo productions that reflect his past achievements in a modern context.
