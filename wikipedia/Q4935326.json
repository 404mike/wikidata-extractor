In 1920 he transferred to Sunderland of the First Division, the highest level of English football. He played as an inside forward, and was known for his control and goalscoring ability. In both the 1924\u201325 and 1926\u201327 seasons he scored nineteen goals, including two hat tricks in consecutive matches in 1927. During Marshall's time at Sunderland the club finished third three times, but did not win any trophies.\nOn 1 March 1928 he transferred to Manchester City, who were in Division Two. With Marshall in the side Manchester City lost just two of their remaining fourteen matches, and were promoted as champions. In the 1930s Marshall featured in two consecutive FA Cup finals, a defeat to Everton in 1933 and a victory against Portsmouth in 1934. in the latter part of his career Marshall changed position, becoming a centre-half. While playing in this defensive role he won a League Championship medal, as part of the Manchester City team which won the title in 1936-37. Marshall made his final appearance for the club one year later, near the end of a season which had shown a marked downturn in fortunes for the club, who were relegated.\nIn March 1939, 11 months after his final Manchester City appearance, Marshall joined Stockport County. Initially signed as a player, he became the club manager shortly after arriving, and held the position for a decade. He later  managed Chesterfield.\nAfter retiring from football, Marshall worked as a publican. He died in 1966 aged 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chesterfield F.C.", "response": ["|Bobby Marshall|| English||1948\u20131952"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Bobby Marshall ||  || Forward / Centre half || 1928\u20131938 || 356 || 80 || ||"]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||8 || Bobby Marshall"]}, {"page": "1933 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Each team played the formation typical of the era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards.

Davison once again tried his formula of signing experienced players, with Dennis Westcott and Cyril Hatton arriving at Saltergate amongst others. He had to endure severe financial constraints with the club only being able to afford 14 full-time professionals. Despite this the team challenged for promotion, finishing sixth in Division Three North four seasons in succession. Davison's youth policy also saw fruition when the youth team reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in 1956 with future World Cup winner Gordon Banks one of the stars. He was asked to manage the Third Division North side against the South in April 1957. Davison stepped down as Chesterfield manager in May 1958, at the age of 70, however he did continue to do some scouting for the club."]}, {"page": "List of Sunderland A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Bobby Marshall"]}, {"page": "Bobby Marshall (disambiguation)", "response": ["Bobby Marshall was an American sportsman.", "Bobby Marshall may also refer to:", "*Bobby Marshall (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131931), Scottish footballer for Liverpool and Portsmouth", "*Bobby Marshall (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131966), footballer for Sunderland, Manchester City and Stockport County", "*Bobby Marshall (Home and Away), a character on Home and Away"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=left| Bobby Marshall"]}, {"page": "Jack Percival (footballer, born 1913)", "response": ["Percival became a Manchester City player in 1933 making his debut in a 1\u20130 victory against Aston Villa.
