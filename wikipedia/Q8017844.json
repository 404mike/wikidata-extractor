He was a liberal member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1895 to 1900 and an Australian Labor Party member of the South Australian House of Assembly (Burra) (1901-1902) and the Australian Senate (1906-1912).Russell was born in Glassford, Scotland, where he became a farm worker. In 1886, he migrated to South Australia, spending three years working on a farm at Alma Plains and three years as a selector at Gulnare Plains before establishing a larger property near Caltowie. He later farmed at Belton in the state's north, where better seasons saw him achieve more success than drought-affected predecessors, and finally near Belalie before retiring from farming in 1900. He was a District Council of Caltowie councillor for five years and a District Council of Carrieton councillor for three years, serving a term as Carrieton chairman. He was a member of the South Australian Farmers Union for many years and served a term as vice-president.Russell was elected to the Legislative Council as a liberal for the North-Eastern District at the 1894 election. He supported women's suffrage, adult suffrage for the House of Assembly and an increased franchise for the Legislative Council. He was a member of a Taxation Commission investigating the state Taxation Department, and opposed the introduction of an income tax, viewing it as unjust. He sought re-election as a Labor candidate at the May 1900 election, but was defeated. Russell returned to politics a year later when he won a 1901 by-election for the House of Assembly seat of Burra upon the resignation of Frederick Holder, but lost his seat at the 1902 election. He unsuccessfully contested a Legislative Council by-election in 1903 and the 1905 election.He was elected to the Senate for the Labor Party at the 1906 federal election. The Observer wrote that \"Russell was not a cultured speaker, but his addresses on the hustings and in Parliament were forceful, and characterized by a rugged native eloquence.\" In June 1912, he was campaigning with Alexander Poynton at Lipson when he began experiencing heart problems; he was taken to a private hospital at Tumby Bay, but died there on 28 June. He was buried at Payneham Cemetery. His death necessitated an appointment to replace him in the Senate; the South Australian Parliament, controlled by the Liberal Union, successfully installed Liberal John Shannon, the first instance when a Senator of a different party was appointed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Russell", "response": ["* William Russell (American actor) (1884\u20131929), stage and screen performer", "* William Russell (English actor) (born 1924), film and TV performer", "* William Russell (merchant) (1740\u20131818), English businessman", "* William Russell (educator) (1798\u20131873), American teacher born in Scotland", "* William Russell (knight) (1257\u20131311), holder of a moiety of the feudal barony of North Cadbury, Somerset", "* William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (1553/63\u20131613), English military commander", "* Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet, of Chippenham (before 1585\u20131654), English MP for Windsor", "* Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet, of Wytley (1602\u20131669), English MP for Worcestershire", "* William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford (1616\u20131700), English peer and soldier", "* William Russell, Lord Russell (1639\u20131683), English politician", "* Lord William Russell (1767\u20131840), MP best known as a murder victim", "* Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet, of Charlton Park (1773\u20131839), British baronet", "* William Russell (1798\u20131850), Member of Parliament (MP) for Saltash, Bletchingley and County Durham", "* William Russell, 8th Duke of Bedford (1809\u20131872), member of United Kingdom Parliament", "* Sir William Russell, 2nd Baronet (1822\u20131892), MP for Dover, 1857\u20131859", "* William Russell (Bolton MP) (1859\u20131937), Member of Parliament for Bolton, 1922\u20131923", "* William Russell (born 1965), Lord Mayor of London, 2019\u20132021", "* William Russell (Virginia politician) (1735\u20131793), Virginia frontier soldier and legislator, father of William Russell of Kentucky", "* William Russell (Kentucky politician) (1758\u20131825), American soldier, pioneer, and politician", "* William Russell (Ohio politician) (1782\u20131845), U.S. Representative from Ohio", "* William Russell (New South Wales politician) (1807\u20131866), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* William Russell (New Zealand politician) (1838\u20131913), Member of Parliament", "* William Russell (Australian politician) (1842\u20131912), Australian senator from South Australia", "* William Russell (bishop of Sodor) (before 1300\u20131374), Cistercian prelate from Isle of Man", "* William Russell (bishop of North China) (1821\u20131879), Irish Protestant missionary to China", "* William Russell (physician) (1852\u20131940), Scottish pathologist", "* William Russell (cricketer) (1866\u20131929), Australian-born English first-class cricketer", "* William Russell (fencer) (1896\u20131958), American Olympic fencer", "* William Russell (writer) (1741\u20131793), Scottish historical and miscellaneous writer", "* William Russell (fiction writer) (1806\u20131876), English writer of detective and other stories", "* William Russell (organist) (1777\u20131813), English composer", "* Lady William Russell (1793\u20131874), English socialite, wife of Lord George William Russell", "* Sir William Russell, 1st Baronet (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1906 Australian federal election", "response": ["| Thomas Playford || |David CharlestonSir Josiah Symon*Joseph Vardon* || |Reginald BlundellDugald CrosbyWilliam Russell*"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1910 Australian federal election", "response": ["Three seats were up for election.

In 1896, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Yorke Peninsula, transferring to Wallaroo in 1902. He left the Assembly in 1905. In 1912, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Liberal Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Labor Senator William Russell. This was the first time a state government had successfully replaced a Senator with a Senator of a different party, after Labor's failed attempt in 1907 to appoint James O'Loghlin to succeed Joseph Vardon. Defeated in 1913, he was elected in 1914 (with over 95% of the vote) due to the death of Labor Senator Gregor McGregor, which left the Labor Party with only five nominees. They directed the sixth vote to Shannon, resulting in an easy return to the Senate. He joined the Nationalist Party when it formed in 1917, and from 1917 to 1920 served as Chairman of Committees. Shannon did not stand at the 1919 federal election, and his term ended on 30 June 1920.
