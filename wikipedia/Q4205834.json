A Gary Caldwell own goal was pulled back by Mohamed Diam\u00e9, but David N'Gog, opening his account for Bolton, regained the lead on the stroke of half time. Kevin Davies had a second half penalty saved by former Bolton goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi before Chris Eagles secured the win in second half injury time. However a week later their poor run at home continued with a 2\u20130 loss to Sunderland, late goals from St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon and Nicklas Bendtner leaving Bolton still in the relegation zone where they remained after the next game, away at Swansea City where goals scored by Joe Allen, Scott Sinclair and Danny Graham saw Bolton fall to one off the bottom. Bolton's only goal was put into his own net by Graham, whilst Ricardo Gardner was sent off for the third time in his Bolton career after receiving two yellow cards. Going into their next game at home to Stoke City, Bolton were in danger of setting a new record if they lost their sixth home game in a row from the start of the season. However an early, and contentious, Kevin Davies goal along with braces from both Chris Eagles and Ivan Klasni\u0107 gave Bolton a 5\u20130 win, equalling their best ever victory in the Premier League. The game also marked the league debut of Joe Riley who received a standing ovation from the fans when substituted late in the game. The scoreline was the reverse of the FA Cup Semi Final the previous March which, ironically, had been overseen by the same referee, Howard Webb. The result left Bolton just inside the relegation zone going into an international break.", "|align=\"left\"|39||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Joe Riley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premier Reserve League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Joe Riley"]}, {"page": "Michael O'Halloran (footballer)", "response": ["O'Halloran started his professional career at Bolton Wanderers, regularly playing in the reserve side. A product of the youth system, he made his d\u00e9but in the League Cup tie at home to Macclesfield Town on 24 August 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute for Martin Petrov. His form in the reserves prompted Bolton to offer both O'Halloran and Joe Riley new three and a half-year contracts, committing them to the club until the summer of 2015. In March 2012, O'Halloran joined Sheffield United on loan until the end of the season, and made his d\u00e9but for the Blades on as an 81st-minute substitute against Chesterfield in a 4\u20131 victory at Bramall Lane. O'Halloran was in and out of the side for the remainder of his spell, with his final appearance for the Blades coming at Wembley for the League One play-off final in which he came on as a substitute in extra time.

Newell's shot was straight at the goalkeeper, and Joe Riley was then brought on for Bolton.  Lavery then took the ball in space but his shot curled wide of the Shrewsbury post.  With fifteen minutes of regular time remaining, Ryan Williams was brought on for Taylor.  Two chances were missed by Lavery before John-Lewis' shot went wide of Rodak's post.  Michael Smith then saw his shot saved, and with chances at either end missed, the match went into five minutes of additional time.
