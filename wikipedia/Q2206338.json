The series also starred Liza Tarbuck as a heavily fictionalised version of herself, forced to be the fictional show's producer despite her actual career goal of creating and producing game shows, and Lorna Brown as the production assistant, Abba.

Mrs Lipton is rarely seen out of the kitchen. By 1927, she had worked for the Meldrum family for forty years. Although a kindly woman who shows sympathy for her betters and equals, Mrs. Lipton is particularly scathing towards those she considers inferior, such as Henry and Mabel. At the start of the series, she develops a relationship with Alf Stokes, willingly lending him money because she believes that he needs it to fund a divorce (although Ivy's allusion to the fact that Alf and her mother don't have a photograph from their wedding day implies that he may not be married at all) and baking huge quantities of cakes for an \"orphanage\" (in reality, Alf had spotted an opportunity to sell baked goods to a short-staffed tea room). Alf further deceives Blanche by enlisting an actress friend, Myrtle, to pose as an unwilling-to-divorce Mrs. Stokes; when an angry and frustrated Blanche unleashes her fury by throwing an entire dinner service at Alf, he manipulates her into thinking that he convinced Lord Meldrum not to sack her by paying for the damage, effectively clearing his debt to her. (In reality, Lord Meldrum had not been concerned about the incident and was persuaded to overlook it thanks to a kind word from the Honourable Teddy.) Mrs. Lipton later shifts her affections to PC Wilson, and when he reaches retirement age, they marry and move to his countryside cottage."]}, {"page": "The Medicine Men (The Avengers)", "response": ["* Brenda Cowling as Masseuse"]}]}}
