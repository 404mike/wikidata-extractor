Although an amateur himself, he played for several professional clubs, including Watford, Derby County\u2014 with whom he won the Football League First Division in 1911\u201312\u2013and later Leeds United. He represented the England national amateur football team, and also the Great Britain Olympic football team, with whom he won an Olympic gold medal at the 1912 games in Sweden. He is also one of very few players to have played for both Leeds City (65 appearances and 17 goals) and Leeds United (1 appearance 0 goals).After retirement he enjoyed a long career as a sports journalist, becoming president of the Football Writers Association. He served as editor of the Athletic News Football Annual and also of the Athletic News Cricket Annual. In 1936 he was selected by the BBC to be one of two journalists (the other being Norman Creek) who for the first time provided live commentary on the FA Cup Final. He continued to contribute a hard-hitting article to the Wolverhampton Wanderers match day programme for many years right up to his death. He produced a volume of memoirs \"40 Years in Football\" in 1954, as well as writing \"Soccer Top Ten\" in 1962, detailing his ten favorite players.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leeds City F.C.", "response": ["In the wake of its demise, Leeds United was formed, and entered the Football League the following year.

The number of teams rose to eleven in 1912, when the competition was organised by the Swedish Football Association. Many of these early matches were unbalanced, as evidenced by high scoring games; two players, Sophus Nielsen in 1908 and Gottfried Fuchs in 1912, each scored ten goals in a single match. All players were amateurs, in accordance with the Olympic spirit, which meant that some countries could not send their full international team. The National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Ireland asked the Football Association to send an English national amateur team. Some of the English members played with professional clubs, most notably Derby County's Ivan Sharpe, Bradford City F.C. Harold Walden and Chelsea's Vivian Woodward.
