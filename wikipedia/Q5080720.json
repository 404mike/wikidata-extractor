Living throughout his life in the Cornish seaside town of Falmouth, Fox in the early decades of his life was a senior partner of his family's timber firm, Fox Stanton & Company, and was also on the Board of Messrs G C Fox & Company, a long-established firm of shipping agents.\n\nFox is described by chess historian Thomas Rayner Dawson (1889\u20131951) as \"a friendly man, kind, mellow, lovable, bringing peace and comfort and serene joy with him\".  He was also a discreet but active homosexual.  In 1909 he visited Venice with his friend James Cockerton, meeting the writer Frederick Rolfe and becoming the reluctant recipient of Rolfe's famous Venice Letters, in which the gay subculture of Venice is vividly described.\nIn 1912\u201313 Fox was blackmailed by a woman who accused him of seducing her 16-year-old son.  Eventually Fox reported the matter to the police and the woman was sent to prison for five years and her son for one year, with hard labour. However, Fox was profoundly affected by the publicity surrounding the case, which was reported in detail in the local press.  The predictable result of his courageous action was the destruction of his reputation, and the compromise of his business and social life in Falmouth.\nAlthough he continued to live in Cornwall, the focus of his social life shifted to London, and in the last two decades of his life, Fox became prominent in the world of chess. He was elected President of the Cornwall Chess Association, played a prominent part in the development of the British Chess Problem Society, and is still renowned as one of the greatest ever exponents of fairy chess (chess problems with variations in the rules).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Falmouth, Cornwall", "response": ["* Charles Masson Fox (1866 in Falmouth \u2013 1935) Cornish businessman, prominent in chess problems and has his place in the gay history of Edwardian England"]}, {"page": "Frederick Rolfe", "response": ["Rolfe was entirely comfortable with his homosexuality and associated and corresponded with a number of other homosexual Englishmen. Early in his life he wrote a fair amount of idealistic but mawkish poetry about boy martyrs and the like. These and his Toto stories contain pederastic elements, but the young male pupils he was teaching at the time unanimously recalled in later life that there had never been any hint of impropriety in his relations with them. As he himself matured, Rolfe's settled sexual preference was for late adolescents. Towards the end of his life he made his only explicit reference to his specific sexual age preference, in one of the Venice letters to Charles Masson Fox, in which he declared: \"My preference was for the 16, 17, 18 and large.\"Rolfe to Fox, 13 January 1910, in Cecil Woolf ed., The Venice Letters, Cecil & Amelia Woolf, 1974, p.46. In a September 1909 letter to John Gambril Nicholson, Rolfe discussed the subject of sex between a man and a boy, a matter, he told Nicholson, of which \"you have the practical experience which I have not.\" (Miriam J Benkovitz, Frederick Rolfe: Baron Corvo, Hamish Hamilton, 1977, p.248, quoting a letter in the Martyr Worthy Collection, Columbia University Library). Nicholson is the person Rolfe is least likely to have lied to about this.
