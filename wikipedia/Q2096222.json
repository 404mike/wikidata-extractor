She constantly makes sure she takes all letters in person, never allowing him to put them in the letterbox itself and sternly rebuking him when he tries to do so. She frequently makes impossible demands of him, such as letting her see Elizabeth's mail, or switching all second class stamps on her letters to first class stamps, or having him track down packages or letters that were never actually sent. He tries many techniques to not speak to Hyacinth, but all fail. In later episodes he develops a bad twitch, and he openly tells Hyacinth it is her fault, but she seems not to notice.

He dresses in a long leather double-breasted coat over a pinstriped suit, with a wide-brimmed leather hat, leather gloves and octagonal steel-rimmed glasses. In the episode \"Watch the Birdie\" (series 5, episode 9), he is shown wearing an SS uniform with the insignia of Sturmbannf\u00fchrer, and he may actually hold that rank, given that he is the godson of Heinrich Himmler (whose telephone number, according to Herr Flick, is \"Berlin 1\"). He fancies the equally blonde Helga Geerhart, whom he plans to marry after the war. He has a considerably exaggerated limp, and frequently uses the word 'Gestapo' as an adjective: \"My powerful Gestapo binoculars\", \"My Gestapo staff car\" etc. In one episode he answers the phone by announcing himself as \"Flick, the Gestapo\"; after a short period, he is forced to explain to the caller that he said \"Flick, the Gestapo\" and not \"Fick (German for the \"f-word\") the Gestapo\". Herr Flick often hits von Smallhausen on the head with his cane, saying \"Wrong!\" When Herr Flick wants Helga to kiss him, he will say in a stern manner \"You may kiss me now!\" In the episode \"Pigeon Post\", it is revealed that he has the same taste in undergarments as Helga. Inviting Helga to the Gestapo dance, he explains their song, which is sung to the tune of \"Do the Hokey-Cokey\": \"You put your left boot in! You take your left boot out!
