The decree, now known as the Bishops' Ban of 1599, ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by John Marston, Thomas Middleton, Joseph Hall, and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's Privy Council, and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse."]}, {"page": "Christ's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Richard Bancroft"]}, {"page": "1610", "response": ["* November 2 \u2013 Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury (b. 1544)"]}, {"page": "1544", "response": ["** Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1610)"]}, {"page": "Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)", "response": ["Many Puritans had hoped that reforms and reconciliation would be possible when James came to power which would allow them independence, but the Hampton Court Conference of 1604 denied nearly all of the concessions which they had requested\u2014except for an updated English translation of the Bible. The same year, Richard Bancroft became Archbishop of Canterbury and launched a campaign against Puritanism and the Separatists. He suspended 300 ministers and fired 80 more, which led some of them to found more Separatist churches. Robinson, Clifton, and their followers founded a Brownist church, making a covenant with God \"to walk in all his ways made known, or to be made known, unto them, according to their best endeavours, whatsoever it should cost them, the Lord assisting them\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Coke", "response": ["Coke's changed position from Attorney General to Chief Justice allowed him to openly attack organisations he had previously supported. His first target was the Court of High Commission, an ecclesiastical court established by the monarch with near unlimited power; it administered a mandatory ex officio oath that deliberately trapped people. The High Commission was vastly unpopular among both common lawyers and Members of Parliament, as the idea of \"prerogative law\" challenged both authorities. The appointment of Richard Bancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1604 caused the issue to grow in importance; according to P.B. Waite, a Canadian historian, Bancroft's zeal and strictness \"could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize, in which logic would supplant reasonableness\". The judges, particularly Coke, began to unite with Parliament in challenging the High Commission.  In 1607 Parliament openly asked for Coke's opinion on the High Commission's practices; he replied that \"No man ecclesiastical or temporal shall be examined upon secret thoughts of his heart or of his secret opinion\"."]}, {"page": "John Whitgift", "response": ["While at Cambridge he formed a close relationship with Andrew Perne, sometime vice-chancellor. Perne went on to live with Whitgift in his old age. Puritan satirists would later mock Whitgift as \"Perne's boy\" who was willing to carry his cloak-bag \u2013 thus suggesting that the two had enjoyed a homosexual relationship.Patrick Collinson, Richard Bancroft and Elizabethan Anti-Puritanism, University of Cambridge, 2013"]}]}}
