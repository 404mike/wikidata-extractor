Rutterford was a left-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium.  He was born in Lakenheath, Suffolk.\nRutterford made his debut for Suffolk in the 1965 Minor Counties Championship against Buckinghamshire.  Rutterford played Minor counties cricket for Suffolk from 1965 to 1986, making 119 Minor Counties Championship appearances and 4 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances.  Rutterford took 431 wickets in the Minor Counties Championship for Suffolk, second only to Cyril Perkins, who took 779.  He made his List A debut against Kent in the 1966 Gillette Cup.  He made seven further List A matches for Suffolk, the last of which came against Worcestershire in the 1984 NatWest Trophy.  In his eight List A matches for Suffolk, he scored 57 runs at an average of 28.50, with a high score of 22 not out.  With the ball, he took 7 wickets at a bowling average of 29.28, with best figures of 3/14.Playing for Suffolk allowed Rutterford to represent Minor Counties East in the 1978 Benson & Hedges Cup, with him making three appearances against Middlesex, Sussex and Northamptonshire.  In these matches, he took 4 wickets at an average of 30.25, with best figures of 2/16.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cyril Perkins", "response": ["In 1951 he made his final first-class appearance, which came for the Minor Counties cricket team against Kent. In his final first-class match, he scored 8 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings and an unbeaten 21 in their second-innings. However, he went wicket-less with the ball and Kent won by an innings. This meant he went winless in his 57 first-class appearances, a record for the number of first-class appearances without featuring in a win. Perkins continued to play for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship until 1967, having by then made 105 appearances for the county. By the time of his retirement at the age of 56, he had claimed a record 779 wickets for the county, some way ahead of Colin Rutterford's 431. Such was Perkins' accuracy as a bowler, The Daily Telegraph reporter Simon Parry-Crooke described watching him bowl as: \"he had this incredible control: he could just drop the ball on a handkerchief.\"  Indeed, he once took 10 wickets in an innings, when playing against Hertfordshire in 1960. He still had the match ball when he celebrated his 100th birthday. Perkins also made a solitary List A appearance for Suffolk at the age of 55 in the 1966 Gillette Cup against a powerful Kent side at Ipswich School. He bowled 12 wicket-less overs for the cost of 31 runs, while he wasn't required to bat in the Suffolk innings as Kent ran out winners by 113 runs."]}, {"page": "Emmanuel Benjamin", "response": ["Benjamin spent the 1980 English season playing for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship, a spell which included half-centuries against Buckinghamshire and Shropshire.Bedfordshire v Buckinghamshire, Minor Counties Championship 1980 \u2013 CricketArchive.
