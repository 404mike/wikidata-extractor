The exact find location is not known, but it was probably somewhere between the Mouseion Hill and the River Ilisos.  It was acquired by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin.  His descendants sold it to John Hewett before the 1950s, and it was then acquired by Hon Robert Erskine, the son of John Erskine, Lord Erskine.   A fragment was sold at Sotheby's in 1994, and later reunited with the other fragments which were bought privately.  It was loaned to the British Museum, and then acquired by the British Museum in 2004 from the Trustees of the Stanford Place Collection, using \u00a340,000 provided by The Art Fund, and funds from the Wolfson Foundation, Alexander Talbot Rice, British Museum Friends, the Caryatid Fund, and the Society of Dilettanti Charitable Trust"]}, {"page": "Alexander Talbot-Rice", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Talbot Rice"]}]}}
