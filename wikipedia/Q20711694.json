He was born in Ladywood, Birmingham and died at Wingrove, Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the younger brother of the England Test player Harry Howell.\nLike this brother, Albert Howell was a right-arm bowler, though he was described as fast-medium rather than fast. He made a few first-class appearances for Warwickshire in 1919 and 1920, but was a fairly regular member of the team in 1921, his best season, when he took 31 wickets at the, for the time, rather high average of 32.61 runs per wicket. The season included his only five-wicket haul, figures of five wickets for 65 runs in the second innings of the match against Middlesex at Lord's. He was not successful in 1922 and did not play for the county after that season.\nHowell moved to North-East England and between 1926 and 1936 he played in Minor Counties cricket for Durham, at that stage not a first-class county team. At this level of cricket, he was highly effective and in 1929 he was picked for the Minor Counties representative team that met Lancashire in a first-class fixture: the match was ruined by rain and Howell failed to take a wicket, but it was his last first-class cricket appearance.He died on his 60th birthday.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Howell (name)", "response": ["*Albert Howell (cricketer) (1898\u20131958), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Albert Howell (1919\u20131922) : A.

His single first-class appearance came as an allowed substitute in a non-County Championship match against Worcestershire in which Warwickshire, having an extremely unsuccessful season, tried several amateur players; Tyler took the place of Albert Howell, who had been injured early in the match while bowling. Tyler did not bat, bowl or take any catches during the match, and was not selected by Warwickshire again."]}]}}
