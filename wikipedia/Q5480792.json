William Baker Ashton became the first Governor, a position he held until his death 1854. From that time the police no longer staffed the gaol, as Ashton now had his own budget. Also, he was now fully answerable to the Sheriff, instead of the Commissioner of Police. Gaol staff consisted of two \"turnkeys\" and two guards. During this time the gaol was commonly referred to by the public as Ashton's Hotel. From 1867 to 1869 Sister Mary MacKillop, foundress of the Australian Sisters of Saint Joseph and later canonised as Australia's first Saint, regularly visited the gaol and along with members of her order tended both male and female prisoners. Sister Mary's order initially provided assistance for female prisoners after their release until November 1867 when the order extended its services to all women. At times the prison was guarded by a number of troops on loan from Tasmania until 1846 when Francis Dutton, who went on to become the seventh Premier of South Australia in 1863, complained that the gaol was both an eyesore and a waste of money as since being opened it had housed on average only two prisoners per month."]}, {"page": "Agent-general", "response": ["* Francis Dutton, 1865\u20131877"]}, {"page": "Francis Stacker Dutton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Dutton"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Light", "response": ["| Francis Dutton", "| Francis Dutton"]}, {"page": "Lake Dutton", "response": ["The lake was discovered again by Benjamin Herschel Babbage who reported in July 1858 in a dispatch to Francis Dutton.
