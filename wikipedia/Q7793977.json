He helped chart the northern coasts of Canada. He died by violence near the Turtle River while traveling through the wilderness in what is now the U.S. state of North Dakota, but was then part of the Territory of Iowa. The circumstances of his final hours\u2014in which he allegedly killed himself after gunning down two companions\u2014have long been a subject of controversy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northwest Passage", "response": ["In the first half of the 19th century, some parts of the Northwest Passage (north of the Bering Strait) were explored separately by many expeditions, including those by John Ross, Elisha Kent Kane, William Edward Parry, and James Clark Ross; overland expeditions were also led by John Franklin, George Back, Peter Warren Dease, Thomas Simpson, and John Rae. In 1826 Frederick William Beechey explored the north coast of Alaska, discovering Point Barrow."]}, {"page": "Victoria Island", "response": ["In 1826 John Richardson saw the southwest coast and called it \"Wollaston Land\". In 1839 Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson followed its southeast coast and called it \"Victoria Land\". A map published by John Barrow in 1846 shows a complete blank from these two lands north to \"Banks Land\" which is the north coast of Banks Island.Derek Hayes,\"Historical Atlas of the Arctic\", map 136 In 1851 John Rae charted its entire south coast and connected the two \"lands\". In 1850 and 1851 Robert McClure circumnavigated most of Banks Island, thereby separating it from the rest of Victoria Land. His men also charted the northwest and west coasts of Victoria Island."]}, {"page": "John Rae (explorer)", "response": ["From 1836 to 1839, the Scottish explorer and fur trader Thomas Simpson sailed along much of the northern coast of Canada. His cousin Sir George Simpson proposed to link the furthest-east point Thomas Simpson had reached by sending an overland expedition from Hudson Bay. Rae was chosen because of his well-known skill in overland travel, but he first had to travel to the Red River Colony to learn the art of surveying. On , Rae left Moose Factory, went up the Missinaibi River, and took the usual voyageur route west.", "By 1848, it was clear that Sir John Franklin's expedition, which had traveled west from the coast of Greenland in 1845, had been lost in the Arctic. Three expeditions were sent to find him: one from the east, one through the Bering Strait, and one overland to the Arctic coast, this last led by Sir John Richardson. Most of the Arctic coast had been traced a decade earlier by Thomas Simpson. North of the coast were two coastlines called Wollaston Land and Victoria Land (Victoria Island). Franklin's crew was thought to be somewhere in the unexplored area north of that. The 61-year-old Richardson chose Rae as his second-in-command.", "On 25 April 1851, he left the fort. On 2 May he crossed the frozen strait via Douglas Island to Lady Franklin Point, the southwestern-most point on Victoria Island. Heading east he passed and named the Richardson Islands and passed what he thought was the westernmost point reached by Thomas Simpson on his return journey in 1839. Heading west he passed Lady Franklin Point and followed the coast north and west around Simpson Bay, which he named. The coast swung north but it was getting late."]}]}}
