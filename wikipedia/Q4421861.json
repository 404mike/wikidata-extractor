As usual he adapts historical facts freely in the construction of his fiction, though he generally follows Comines' balanced approach to the character of Louis XI. He was able to make substantial use of other documents and the editorial commentary in the collection in which Comines was included, the first series of the Collection complete des m\u00e9moires relatifs a l'histoire de France by [Claude Bernard] Petitot (1819\u201226). Occasional details are drawn from a wide range of historians, most of whom were more hostile to Louis. It is likely that some details for Scott's descriptions of northern France were derived from manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw. For his gipsy material Scott relied largely on two works: 'Dissertation on the Gipseys ... from the German of H. M. G. Grellmann (1807), and A Historical Survey of the Customs, Habits, and Present State of the Gypsies by John Hoyland (1816).Ibid., 497\u2013504."]}, {"page": "Alexandros Rizos Rangavis", "response": ["After his recall he lived in Athens, where he died on 28 June 1892.

Her father was a great friend of Sir Walter Scott, and it is said that as a child Skene would sit on the novelist's knee and tell him fairy tales. As a girl she was the guest of Stratford Canning at the embassy at Constantinople; and later was the friend of, among others, Florence Nightingale, Sir John Franklin, E. B. Pusey, Walter Savage Landor and William Edmondstoune Aytoun.
