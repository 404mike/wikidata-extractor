They underwent many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith as the only constant member. The Fall's long-term musicians included drummers Paul Hanley, Simon Wolstencroft and Karl Burns; guitarists Marc Riley, Craig Scanlon and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from early 1980s albums such as Hex Enduction Hour to the late 1990s.", "The Fall released their fourth single \"Fiery Jack\", their last for Step Forward, on 13 January 1980. In March, Mike Leigh left the group and went back to the cabaret circuit. According to Leigh, the band would have to wait for weeks without work while Smith came up with new lyrics, as opposed to regular weekly gigs in cabaret. Leigh's replacement was Paul Hanley, Steve Hanley's younger brother. He first played live with the Fall on Friday 21 March at Electric Ballroom, London \u2013 he was only 16 and was actually still at school. Meanwhile, the Fall quit Step Forward and signed with Rough Trade; the first release on a new label became Totale's Turns in May 1980. This, with the exception of two tracks, was a live album documenting the band during various appearances in 1979, with Smith announcing last orders at the bar [responding to a request for the song \"Last Orders\"] and berating band members and audience throughout.", "As the Fall were going to tour America after the release of Slates, Paul Hanley was denied a visa as he was too young to play American clubs that serve alcohol, which restrict entry to those age 21 or older. Smith thus invited Karl Burns back into the group, initially as a temporary replacement. Select recordings from this tour were released in 1982 as A Part of America Therein, 1981. After their return to the UK, Burns stayed in the group as a second drummer alongside Hanley. The first record to feature both Burns and Hanley became the \"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\" single, produced by Richard Mazda and released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1981.", "This era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of R. Dean Taylor's \"There's a Ghost in My House\" (no. 30, 1987) and the Kinks' \"Victoria\" (no. 35, 1988) and their own songs \"Hey! Luciani\" (no. 59, 1986) and \"Hit the North\" (no. 57, 1987), and enjoyed a string of critically acclaimed albums: The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall (1984), This Nation's Saving Grace (1985), Bend Sinister (1986), and The Frenz Experiment (1988). I Am Kurious, Oranj is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer Michael Clark. Simon Rogers and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall, and Simon Wolstencroft replaced other drummer Burns after This Nation's Saving Grace. Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \"nimble\" and \"funky\" when compared to Burns. In 2014 Wolstencroft published a memoir You Can Drum But You Can't Hide about his 11-year stint in the Fall.", "In 2014, former members Brix Smith Start, Steve Hanley and Paul Hanley formed a new group called Brix & the Extricated.O'Hagan, Sean. \"Brix Smith Start: \u2018Mark E Smith?

Smith also stated of the songs that \"some of them are just me and Karl double-tracked\" Whilst these remarks resulted in considerable conjecture among fans, the exact lineups for each track have never been properly confirmed. In a letter to City Life magazine in April 1984, Smith noted that Riley only played on two tracks on Room to Live, and in 2008 Riley confirmed via his BBC6 radio show that he did not appear on all tracks. In his book \"The Big Midweek\", Steve Hanley states that \"Marquis Cha-Cha\" was recorded by a trio of himself, Burns and Smith and also confirms the role of Arthur Kadmon (from Ludus and credited as \"Cadman\") in the recording of \"Hard Life in Country\" at a session to which neither Craig Scanlon nor Marc Riley were invited. Hanley's version, however, appears to refute the much-rumoured story, as relayed by Mick Middles in his book \"The Fall\" (co-authored with Mark E Smith), that suggested that Kadmon recorded approximately sixteen seconds of guitar and was then dismissed. Drummer Paul Hanley described the recording of the album as \"a fucking nightmare.

Both Hanleys were persuaded to return for a televised performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test, where The Fall played \"Lay of the Land\" accompanied by the Michael Clark Dance Company. Eventually, Brix talked Mark into making peace with Steve Hanley, whom she considered as the anchor and the most reliable person in the band; his departure was then changed to a temporary leave, as he was under the additional stress of having to look after his ill premature-born son.
