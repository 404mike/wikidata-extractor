He won the World Snooker Championship in 1947 and 1950, as well as finishing as runner-up to Fred Davis six times as the pair contested eight consecutive world finals from 1947 to 1954.\nDonaldson became a professional player shortly after winning the British Junior English Billiards Championship (Under-16 section) in 1922, and won the Scottish professional billiards title several times. He first competed in the World Snooker Championship in 1933 but after a heavy defeat by Joe Davis, did not enter again until 1939. After serving in the Fourth Indian Division during World War II, Donaldson entered the 1946 World Championship, where he lost to Davis in his first match. As a player that did not reach the championship final, he was eligible to enter the 1946 Albany Club Professional Snooker Tournament, which he won. Following Joe Davis's retirement from the World Championship in 1946, Donaldson practised intensively and won the 1947 Championship by defeating Fred Davis in the final. Fred Davis won the following two championships, with Donaldson taking the next, and then being runner-up to Davis for the next four years. Donaldson then retired from World Championship competition, although he did continue to play in the News of the World Snooker Tournament until 1959.\nDonaldson was known for his long potting, his aversion to the use of side, and his consistency when playing. In 2012, Donaldson was posthumously inducted into the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's World Snooker Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": {}}}
