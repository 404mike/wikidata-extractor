She had already started skiing by this time, having first tried it at the age of two, but took up snowboarding in the footsteps of her brothers William and Thomas, who have both also competed in the sport internationally. She started competing internationally for France in 2010. The following year she sustained a pelvis fracture in a crash, which left her in \"constant pain\" and unable to train at full intensity for several years.She made her debut on the FIS Snowboard World Cup a few months before representing France at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. She also competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, where she finished 7th. After the 2018 Games she switched from representing France to competing for Great Britain, in part due to struggling to fully recover from her pelvic injury, despite the French Ski Federation paying for surgery and therapy. She took her first World Cup podium finish for Team GB in a race in Breuil-Cervinia in December 2018, where she pipped her French former team-mate Nelly Moenne-Loccoz to third place.She participated at the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2019, winning a silver medal in the snowboard cross competition.. Two years later, she went one better at the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2021, when she won the snowboard cross competition..", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FIS Snowboard World Championships", "response": ["|Manon PetitCharlotte Bankes"]}, {"page": "Charlotte Banks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Bankes"]}, {"page": "France at the 2014 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Charlotte Bankes"]}, {"page": "2021 in sports", "response": ["** Snowboard Cross winners:  Lucas Eguibar (m) /  Charlotte Bankes (f)", "** Women's winners:  Eva Samkov\u00e1 (No. 1) /  Charlotte Bankes (No. 2)"]}, {"page": "2022 in sports", "response": ["** Winners:  Alessandro H\u00e4mmerle (m) /  Charlotte Bankes (f)", "** Women's winner:  Charlotte Bankes (2 times)"]}, {"page": "Snowboarding at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's snowboard cross", "response": ["| 5 || 13|| align=left| Charlotte Bankes ||align=left|  || 1:23.12  ||  || 1:23.12 || ", "| 5 || 5 || align=left | Charlotte Bankes || align=left |  ||"]}, {"page": "Eva Samkov\u00e1", "response": ["At the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2019, Samkov\u00e1 became world champion in Snowboard Cross, defeating Brit Charlotte Bankes in the final.
