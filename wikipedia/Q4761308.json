From a musical family, he is the eldest of three brothers, the other two being proficient bass (Danny) and brass (Ricky) players.\nHe joined Big Boy Tomato, which enjoyed a fair amount of success in North and West London, and their 'New Wave of New Wave' sound saw them supporting bands like UK Subs and Stiff Little Fingers. The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including Acton Baby and the four-track CD Hormones and Hangovers.  The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged.  Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely Asterix and Animaniacs.  One album, Mad Cows and Englishmen, was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls.  Seemingly going nowhere, the band split, though two of the members went on to form The Yo-Yos, a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts.  Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.All this while, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and toured Japan with the band.  Realizing that he was not going to get the gigs he needed if he stayed in London, he moved to the United States, where his working partnership with Watts led to his inclusion in the lineup of KMFDM. He occasionally performs with punk band Dwarves under the alias Dutch Ovens.\nIn late 2007, Selway played the drums for the Seattle rock band DragStrip Riot and Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki in her songs \"Talkin' 2 Myself\" and \"Decision\".\nIn 2008, he went on tour with Genitorturers. In 2009, he toured with his KMFDM bandmate Jules Hodgson's new band, The Spittin' Cobras.He resides in West Palm Beach with his wife, Christee Carter, and son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luton", "response": ["* Andy Selway, drummer"]}, {"page": "Dwarves (band)", "response": ["*Marc Diamond plays guitar, and Andy Selway plays drums on the Royce Cracker single \"Meth Stop Calling\"."]}, {"page": "KMFDM", "response": ["The band's earliest incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts, the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. The trio recorded the band's earliest albums in Germany before Konietzko and Esch moved to the United States, where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label Wax Trax!. German guitarist G\u00fcnter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin) on Metropolis Records, and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli, British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White, and British drummer Andy Selway. Konietzko and Cifarelli moved back to Germany in 2007, while the rest of the band stayed in the U.S. Hodgson and White moved on to other pursuits between 2015 and 2017, leaving the band a working trio unofficially. In addition to these core members, dozens of other musicians have worked with the group across its twenty studio albums and two dozen singles, with sales totaling in excess of two million records worldwide.", "Skold left after Attak to join Marilyn Manson. Over the next few years, Watts' bandmates from Pig joined KMFDM one by one. Jules Hodgson had already done guitar work for 2002's Attak. Andy Selway first played drums for KMFDM on WWIII in 2003, and Steve White contributed to 2005's Hau Ruck after touring with the band. All three, along with Watts and Cifarelli, were mentioned as band members on \"Intro\", the final track on WWIII, although that was to be the last album on which Watts performed.
