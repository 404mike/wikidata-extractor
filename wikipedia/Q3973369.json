In 2017, he created Rainman, Britain's first-ever 9b (5.15b) sport route, and by that stage was responsible for developing the majority of routes graded 9a (5.14d) and above in Britain.  McClure has also been one of the most successful British traditional climbers, and British onsight climbers (in both sport climbing and traditional climbing).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malham Cove", "response": ["The cove is popular with climbers offering easy to hard traditional climbs, as well as sport climbing, including the UK's first  grade sport climb, Rainman, by Steve McClure. Due to the cliff's south face, it is a popular for rock climbing in winter; however, in summer, the face can become very hot."]}, {"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Steve McClure (born 1970) UK, first Briton to climb 9a twice"]}, {"page": "Ben Moon (rock climber)", "response": ["Moon's first officially declared  routes had somewhat controversial names.  The routes were both in France and had been previously attempted for a long time by local climbers.  After climbing them Moon named them after French military disasters, first the Maginot Line, at Volx, and secondly Agincourt, at Buoux.  On 8 June 2015, Moon redpointed the Steve McClure route Rainshadow, , at Malham Cove in North Yorkshire, England."]}, {"page": "Kilnsey", "response": ["The most notable feature of Kilnsey is a large limestone cliff called Kilnsey Crag, overlooking the road and the River Wharfe from the west. The crag is around 170 feet high, with an overhang of 40 feet. It was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1816.  The crag contains several of Britain's most extreme sport climbing routes, such as Northern Lights , and North Star , by Steve McClure."]}, {"page": "Dave MacLeod", "response": ["In April 2006, MacLeod established the climb Rhapsody on  Dumbarton Rock which, at a grade of E11 7a, was possibly the hardest trad climbing route in the world.  Rhapsody is the true finish to the line of Requiem, graded E8 6b. Requiem was climbed in 1983 by Dave Cuthbertson and was one of the hardest rock climbs in the world at the time. It follows a crack-line that fades out to a seam at half height. Requiem follows a flake heading rightwards to finish, while Rhapsody climbs the line of the crack all the way to the top. The top half of the crack gives 8c+ climbing and takes no more protection. MacLeod took many long falls from this runout, three from the last move in which he fell 70 feet and injured himself by hitting the rock at the end of the fall. In 2008 Steve McClure made the third ascent of Rhapsody and confirmed the grade. The ascent of Rhapsody is the subject of the movie E11 (2006) directed by Paul Diffley and produced by Hot Aches Productions. MacLeod has since featured in several more climbing films by Hot Aches Productions."]}, {"page": "McClure (surname)", "response": ["*Steve McClure, British rock climber"]}, {"page": "Adam Ondra", "response": [":*Overshadow - Malham Cove () - May 16, 2011 - Second ascent of Steve McClure's route"]}, {"page": "McClure, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve McClure"]}, {"page": "Hubble (climbing route)", "response": ["* 6th.
