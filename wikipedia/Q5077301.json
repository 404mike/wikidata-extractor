He was born the son of Robert and Priscilla Caroline Sayle. He later served as an under-librarian at Cambridge University Library. His works include Bertha: a story of love (1885), Wicliff: an historical drama (1887), Erotidia (1889), Musa Consolatrix (1893), Private Music (1911) and Cambridge Fragments (1913).

He edited the 3-volume Works of Sir Thomas Browne; volumes I & II were published in 1904 by Grant Richards in London; volume III was published in 1907 by John Grant in Edinburgh.Charles Sayle's salon, a circle of bright, handsome and predominantly homosexual young men who congregated at his house in Cambridge, included Rupert Brooke, George Mallory, Augustus Bartholomew and Geoffrey Keynes.\nSayle's  publisher was Bernard Quaritch, a  bookseller who  specialised in unpopular but praiseworthy scholastic publications.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cambridge University Library", "response": ["Various scholars have held the position. Abraham Wheelocke was librarian of the \"Public Library\" at Cambridge University, and was also Reader in Anglo-Saxon in the 17th century.

Other notable members of staff include the bibliographer Henry Bradshaw and the Uranian poet Charles Edward Sayle, author of a history of the library."]}, {"page": "Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell", "response": ["Russell proved hard work for his grandparents and was sent to school; first Cheam (1877) and then Winchester College (January 1879). Winchester became his spiritual home, and the friends he made there his surrogate family. It was there that he befriended poet and critic Lionel Johnson, whom he would describe as \u201cthe greatest influence of my life at Winchester\u201d though Johnson was the younger man. When Russell went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1883, the pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality. Twice the correspondence was banned by Johnson's father who feared that Russell's Buddhist beliefs would have a baneful influence on Johnson's welfare as a Christian. Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, Charles Edward Sayle, to correspond with Johnson on his behalf. Johnson also corresponded with Sayle's Rugby friend Jack Badley. In 1919, Russell anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence with all three as Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson."]}, {"page": "Uranian poetry", "response": ["The chief poets of this clique were William Johnson Cory, Lord Alfred Douglas, Montague Summers, John Francis Bloxam, Charles Kains Jackson, John Gambril Nicholson, E.\u00a0E. Bradford, John Addington Symonds, Edmund John, John Moray Stuart-Young, Charles Edward Sayle, Fabian S. Woodley, and several pseudonymous authors such as \"Philebus\" (John Leslie Barford) and \"A. Newman\" (Francis Edwin Murray).  The flamboyantly eccentric novelist Frederick Rolfe (also known as \"Baron Corvo\") was a unifying presence in their social network, both within and without Venice."]}, {"page": "Augustus Theodore Bartholomew", "response": ["After graduation he became part of the team tasked with cataloguing Lord Acton's library of 60,000 books, a task which took nine years.  Bartholomew (who was gay) corresponded with authors he admired, including Edward Carpenter (to whom he wrote about the book 'Iolaus' in 1902 and whom he met in 1911), Magnus Hirschfeld (whom he met at one of Edward Dent's dinner parties in 1910) and Ralph Chubb (a younger Cambridge poet whose homosexual poems and paintings had inspired Bartholomew's interest).  In his youth, he had been a member of the circle of handsome (and sometimes homosexual) young men who congregated at Charles Edward Sayle's house in Cambridge, including Rupert Brooke, George Mallory and Geoffrey Keynes, who remained a close friend throughout his life.  Charles Sayle, employed at Cambridge University Library since 1893, became one of the chief figures in his life, taking the young Bartholomew under his wing. In 1909 they invited Henry James to visit Cambridge, where he stayed at Sayle's house.See G. Keynes, Henry James in Cambridge (Cambridge, 1967)  Sayle soon became insecure about his young friend deserting him (Sayle was 18 years Bartholomew's senior). But they remained friends until Sayle's death in 1924, by which time Bartholomew (now in his early forties) now suffered from similar anxieties of growing old in an ever-youthful university city.See Bartholomew's diary for 26 May 1921 (CUL MS Add. 8786/1/13)"]}, {"page": "Charles Sayle", "response": ["#Redirect Charles Edward Sayle"]}, {"page": "List of University Librarians at the University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Richard Moodie (1581\u2013?)Charles Edward Sayle, Annals of Cambridge University Library, 1278-1900.
