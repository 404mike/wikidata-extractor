He was educated at the Royal Naval School, Gosport, but was too old to join the Royal Navy as a Midshipman when he took the exam and instead joined the Merchant Navy. In 1859, he left to join the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1879 he became a resident magistrate in County Mayo and in 1883 was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Although himself a Protestant, he had good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and was a member of several bodies which worked to relieve the poverty of the Irish peasantry.\nIn 1893, Harrel was appointed Under-Secretary for Ireland, a post he held until 1902, when he retired due to ill-health. He continued to sit on many tribunals and voluntary bodies.\nHarrel was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1895, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1900, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).
