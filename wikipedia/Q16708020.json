She specialized in the history of musical instruments and was called in 1911 \"the greatest authority on the subject\". In 1939, her Greek Aulos presented her analysis of the modes used on aulos instruments in ancient Greek music.\nShe was editor of The Portfolio of Musical Archaeology. She was responsible for \"practically all of the articles\" about musical instruments in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica of 1911.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Istrian scale", "response": ["Though, \"relative intonation var[ies] considerably from example to example [and between instruments],\" the scale has also been described as derived from just intonation: subharmonics seven to fourteen (approximately D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D')( and ).Ruland, Heiner (1992).

In , where the word \"tabering\" occurs in the King James Version, it means beating on the breast, as drummers beat on the tabret. The Israelites learned to use the timbrel during their sojourn in Egypt, and in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Kathleen Schlesinger stated \"it has been suggested that as the Egyptians used it to scare away their evil spirit Typhon\", the word tof is derived from the latter. The tabret or timbrel was a favorite instrument of the women, and was used with dances, as by Miriam, to accompany songs of victory, or with the harp at banquets and processions; it was one of the instruments used by King David and his musicians when he danced before the Ark of the Covenant. It was also used in the valley of Hinnom at the sacrificial rites."]}, {"page": "Barbiton", "response": ["Musicologist Kathleen Schlesinger identified a stringed instrument of unknown name that combines the characteristics of both lyre and rebab; It is represented in least four different ancient sculptures: She writes:"]}, {"page": "Epigonion", "response": ["It was undoubtedly a kind of harp or psaltery, since in an instrument of so many strings some must have been of different lengths, for tension and thickness only could hardly have produced forty different sounds, or even twenty, supposing that they were arranged in pairs of unisons. Strings of varying lengths require a frame like that of the harp, or of the Egyptian cithara which had one of the arms supporting the cross bar or zugon shorter than the other, notes for an illustration, see Kathleen Schlesinger, Orchestral Instruments, part ii. \"Precursors of the Violin Family\", fig. 165, p. 219. or else strings stretched over harp-shaped bridges on a sound-board in the case of a psaltery."]}, {"page": "Undertone series", "response": ["Kathleen Schlesinger pointed out, in 1939, that since the ancient Greek aulos, or reed-blown flute, had holes bored at equal distances, it must have produced a section of the undertone series. She said that this discovery not only cleared up many riddles about the original Greek modes, but indicated that many ancient systems around the world must have also been based on this principle."]}, {"page": "Cythara", "response": ["==Kathleen Schlesinger==", "The theory was a variation of an earlier theory, talked about in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's articles about the guitar, cithara and rotta, which were written by Kathleen Schlesinger.The Reader's Guide to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company, 1913 p. 185 Where Winternitz later focused on the cittern, Schlesinger concentrated on the chain of instrument evolution from cithara to guitar. Schlesinger believed that the instrumental change that adapted the lyre into the guitar-like instruments took place among the Greeks in the Anatolian Peninsula, and she saw proof of that transformation in the drawings in the Utrecht Psalter.", "Kathleen Schlesinger wrote the cithar article and talked plainly about the transformation of the ancient instruments into the modern: \"...it was among the Greeks of Asia Minor that the several steps in the transition from cithara into guitar took place. The first of these steps produced the rotta (q.v.), by the construction of body, arms and transverse bar in one piece...the cithara with rectangular body, while from the cithara with a body having the curve of the lower half of the violin was produced a rotta with the outline of the body of the guitar. Both types were common in Europe until the 14th century, some played with a bow, others twanged by the fingers, and bearing indifferently both names, cithara and rotta....The addition of a finger-board, stretching like a short neck from body to transverse bar, leaving on each side of the finger-board space for the hand to pass through in order to stop the strings, produced the crwth or crowd (q.v.), and brought about the reduction in the number of the strings to three or four. The conversion of the rotta into the guitar (q.v.) was an easy transition effected by the addition of a long neck to a body derived from the oval rotta. When the bow was applied the result was the guitar or troubadour fiddle.\""]}]}}
