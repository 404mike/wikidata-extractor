Their distinctive Romanesque sandstone and limestone carvings are to be found in several parish churches in the area, most notably Kilpeck, but also Eardisley, Shobdon and Castle Frome in Herefordshire, and Rock, Worcestershire. Their work draws on a variety of cultural sources for its religious and mystical images; Norman military figures, Anglo-Saxon animals and Celtic abstract patterns combine to create a unique and beautiful synthesis. Despite its overtly religious nature, Herefordshire School work also has a playful, occasionally bawdy approach."]}, {"page": "John Zarnecki", "response": ["Born and raised in Finchley, Middlesex, the son of the art historian George Zarnecki, he was educated at Highgate School in north London and was interested in space exploration from an early age.

Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.Geese \"Romanesque Sculpture\" Romanesque pp. 320\u2013321"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2008", "response": ["*George Zarnecki, 92, Polish art historian and medievalist."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "response": ["*George Zarnecki (1915\u20132008)"]}, {"page": "Peter Lasko", "response": ["Following his retirement from the Courtauld he devoted much of his time to the \"Corpus Of Romanesque Sculpture In Great Britain And Northern Ireland\", a project he took over from George Zarnecki, and a book on German Expressionist art, which was published after his death."]}, {"page": "1970 New Year Honours", "response": ["* George Zarnecki, Professor of History of Art, University of London."]}, {"page": "Jean Bony", "response": ["Bony taught French as an Assistant Master at Eton College from 1937 to 1939. On the outbreak of the Second World War he returned to France and served in the French Army; he was captured, and spent from 1940 to 1943 in prisoner-of-war camps, where he continued his interest in medieval architecture, writing articles, compiling notes, making detailed drawings, and giving educational talks to his fellow-prisoners. He left the French Army as a first lieutenant in 1944. Returning to the UK after the war, he taught briefly at Eton again (1945 to 1946), then became a Reader at the French Institute in London (1946-1961). In parallel with this he was a Visiting Lecturer (1948-1958) and external examiner (1950-1958) at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. With George Zarnecki of the Courtauld he began a project in around 1960 to compile an exhaustive inventory of Romanesque sculpture in the British Isles, which Zarnecki eventually completed after Bony's death. No doubt through Zarnecki's influence, Bony contributed photographs to the Courtauld Institute's Conway Library, an extensive archive of architectural images currently undergoing a digitisation process. Bony has had a great influence on medieval scholarship within The Courtauld Institute, well beyond his time spent there, and still evident in the work of recent and current Courtauld scholars."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 1960s", "response": ["* Professor George Zarnecki"]}, {"page": "Zarnecki, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Zarnecki"]}, {"page": "Deborah Kahn", "response": ["Kahn attended Sarah Lawrence College for undergraduate studies, where she received her B.A. degree.
