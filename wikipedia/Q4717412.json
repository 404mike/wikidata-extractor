Macrae and McMillan appear as The Captain and The Mate, while Mackenzie appears as The Engineer, causing Grieve to move to play The Cook. Although very obviously based on Munro's characters, the names of Para Handy, the Vital Spark, etc. are never mentioned, probably due to copyright issues."]}, {"page": "Alexander Mackenzie", "response": ["*Alex Mackenzie (1885\u20131965), Scottish character actor"]}, {"page": "Chico the Rainmaker", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as the All-Father (hair)"]}, {"page": "Kidnapped (1960 film)", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as The Ferryman"]}, {"page": "Rockets Galore!", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as Joseph Macleod"]}, {"page": "The Battle of the Sexes (1959 film)", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as Robertson"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish actors", "response": ["*Alex Mackenzie (1885\u20131965)"]}, {"page": "Greyfriars Bobby (film)", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as Auld Jock"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1954", "response": ["|The Maggie||Alexander Mackendrick ||Alex Mackenzie, Paul Douglas ||Comedy ||Ealing Studios"]}, {"page": "The Bridal Path (film)", "response": ["* Alex Mackenzie as Finlay"]}]}}
