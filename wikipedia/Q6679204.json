The Earl of Chesterfield's objections concerns the alleged insufficient compensation to be allowed to him as hereditary ranger of Thorney Wood Chase. The earl's claims were apparently met by the promoters, and the bill was amended accordingly.Journals of the House of Commons, 22 March 19 Geo III, Volume 37, p. 44; W. E.

They alleged that if the bill passed it would be prejudicial to their rights and properties (as noted above, only 51 acres of open fields remained)  and injurious to the public in general.  They successfully secured the appointment of an additional, fifth, commissioner, a local man George Padley of Calverton, to represent their interests.Ibid, p. 402; Tate says 'John', but the actual Award is signed by a 'Geo.
