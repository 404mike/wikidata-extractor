He has more recently written for The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.\nHume was born in New Haw, Surrey, and educated at Woking County Grammar School for Boys and the University of Manchester. In his twenties Hume became editor of the next step, newspaper of the now-defunct Revolutionary Communist Party. In 1988 he launched the party's magazine, Living Marxism.After the RCP folded in 1996, Hume helped to relaunch the magazine as LM, which he edited until it was forced to close in 2000 after losing a libel suit brought by ITN, over claims that the magazine had made concerning ITN's reporting of Trnopolje camp in Bosnia.\nIn 2001, Hume was launch editor of the online magazine Spiked, the UK's first web-only comment and current affairs publication. He is now Spiked's editor-at-large.Mick Hume's book, There Is No Such Thing As a Free Press \u2013 and we need one more than ever was published in October 2012 in response to the Leveson Inquiry and the debate about press regulation in the UK. Daniel Finkelstein of The Times described it as \"a masterclass in the writing of polemic\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walthamstow", "response": ["* Mick Hume, journalist"]}, {"page": "Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)", "response": ["Supporting Irish republicanism was central to the work of the party. In 1978, it organised the Smash the Prevention of Terrorism Act Campaign and held protests outside police stations where suspects were held. The party organised a conference of trade unionists opposed to Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom in Coventry in 1981 and later that year held a march to the TUC conference, the Workers March for Irish Freedom. On Saturday 6 February 1982, the Irish Freedom Movement (IFM) was founded at a meeting in Caxton House, Archway and TUC general secretary Len Murray wrote to the thirteen trades councils that sponsored the conference threatening them with disaffiliation if they attended.David Pallister, 'Ulster Conference Ban', Guardian, 4 February 1982 Mick Hume, who edited The Next Step, recalls that the IFM were accused of complicity in the 1984 bombing of the Conservative Party conference.Mick Hume, Brighton bomb memories  Spiked, 13 October 2009 The IFM published a quarterly bulletin Irish Freedom and organised an annual march on the anniversary of internment.

But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate [...]. At different times, different issues matter most. Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on [...]. [A]t Living Marxism, we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism. That is the easy bit. There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics, to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation. [...] [D]ealing with [...] unconventional questions, and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them, is the precondition for making political action possible in our time.The Point is to Change It: A Manifesto for a World Fit for People, London: Junius (1996), p.x-xiii.", "Many former members of the party and some of the people who contributed to LM magazine continue to be politically active, most notably in the Academy of Ideas (formerly the Institute of Ideas), a think tank led by Claire Fox; the online magazine Spiked, initially edited by Mick Hume and later by Brendan O'Neill; and the Manifesto Club in which a leading figure is Munira Mirza, appointed by Boris Johnson as London's Director of Policy for culture, the arts and creative industries, and subsequently as his head of Number 10 policy unit.
