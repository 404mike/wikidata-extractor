He was the pioneer in demonstrating the practicability of trade relations by sea between the North Sea countries and the northern portion of Siberia. Beginning his voyages in 1874, he twice reached the Ob River, and five times carried cargoes to the Yenisei River, up which stream he once navigated his ship 2000 miles (3218 km). He facilitated the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by carrying to that country a large cargo of rails.\nHe was honored by the Czar for his pioneer work, which Baron Nordenski\u00f6ld described as an \"Event rivaling in importance the return of the first fleet loaded with merchandise from India\". In 1894 he was awarded the Murchison Award by the Royal Geographical Society.\nIn 2016, it was reported that the wreck of the steamship Thames, with which Wiggins had made an expedition to the Yenisei River in 1876 and which sank there in 1878, had been discovered.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Seebohm", "response": ["Henry became interested in natural history at school and continued to spend his spare time studying birds on his journeys.

The vessel was specially adapted at the Richmond Dry Dock in Appledore, where an ice-ram was fitted and her quarter-deck extended. Leybourne-Popham appointed Joseph Wiggins as captain of Blencathra for an 1893 voyage to the Kara Sea and into the Yenisei River, thus taking the ship to the furthest reaches of Siberia.  To combine business with pleasure, he formed a syndicate to exploit the commercial opportunities offered by the carriage of cargo to the far north.  As plans were being finalised, Wiggins received an urgent request from the Russians to carry rails for the Trans-Siberian Railway up the Yenisey to Krasnoyarsk. A 2,500-ton steamer, Orestes, was chartered and four Russian river vessels were provided for the final stages of transport in the Yenisey.  With the river vessels embarked in Orestes, and Blencathra in company, the group left Vard\u00f8 on 22 August 1893, reaching the mouth of the Yenisey on 3 September.  Blencathra and Orestes returned to England via Arkhangel, while Wiggins stayed with the Russian river vessels, reaching Yeniseysk on 23 October."]}, {"page": "Bishopwearmouth Cemetery", "response": ["*Joseph Wiggins, Arctic explorer."]}, {"page": "Jonas Lied", "response": ["Lied's idea for a sea route to Yenisei came from the English businessman Alfred Derry and from Joseph Wiggins\u2019 book on the Northeast passage.

The company\u2019s main office was in Krasnoyarsk and eventually offices in St Petersburg (26 Nevsky Prospect across the street from Kazan Cathedral), London, New York, Moscow, Novosibirsk og Arkhangelsk. The initial share capital was  142,000 NOK, and gradually expanded to 8 million in 1917. Lied\u2019s plan was to transport goods through the great rivers of Siberia, and exchange goods to West European ocean vessels at these rivers' arctic mouth. From Krasnoyarks the Yenisei is 2500 km og there was at that time no roads or railways along the river.
