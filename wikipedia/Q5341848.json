The local press commented that \"his policy of parting before an  opponent can get to him is to be commended\". He retained his place for the next two matches, scoring in a 3\u20132 defeat against West Ham United and a 4\u20132 victory at Northampton Town. He then lost his place to Edward Bell for two matches before being recalled for the final match of the season."]}]}}
