He is praised by the audience, particularly for his scathing insults about the guests on his show and his catchphrase \"If you can't be good, be honest\". The video then switches to Patrick Chase on a night out and we see his wild behaviour: he has sex with a woman who is not his wife while her young children are in the next room; gets drunk and buys substances; snorts several lines of cocaine; picks up a prostitute and has sex with her while watching his TV show. We then see a fast montage of his double life: the adoration of his fans and his secret other persona, including a minor car crash while driving under the influence. We also see him being a talk show host to cover up who he really is. The video ends with Patrick sitting in a make up chair, looking at a photo of his wife and children, before beginning a new show with his cheering fans surrounding him.
