He was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first in history. He first visited Germany in 1930, where he became a friend of Helmuth James von Moltke. During the Second World War Balfour worked at the Ministry of Information and the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office (the cover name for the Political Warfare Executive). In 1944 he joined the Psychological Warfare Division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force and after the war he became Director of Public Relations and Information Services, Control Commission, in the British Zone of Allied-occupied Germany.He was Chief Information Officer at the Board of Trade from 1947 to 1964. He was then Professor of European History at the University of East Anglia from 1966 to 1974. In 1934 he married Grizel Wilson (younger sister of his Balliol friend, the diplomat Duncan Wilson, and of philosopher Mary Warnock) and they had three daughters. Balfour died in the Oxfordshire town of Witney nine-and-a-half weeks before his 87th birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Goebbels", "response": ["Goebbels realised that his influence would diminish in wartime. He suffered a series of setbacks as propaganda became less important compared to warfare, the war economy, and the Allied bombing of German cities. Historian Michael Balfour states that from 1942 onward, Goebbels, \"lost control over Nazi policy toward the press and over the handling of news in general.\" Rival agencies expanded. The foreign ministry took charge of propaganda outside Germany.  The military set up its own propaganda division, providing daily reports on the progress of the war and the conditions of the armed forces. The Nazi Party also generated and distributed its own propaganda during the war. Goebbels was still influential when he had the opportunity to meet with Hitler, who became less available as he moved his headquarters closer to the military front lines. They were together perhaps one day a month. Furthermore, Hitler rarely gave speeches or rallies of the sort that had dominated propaganda in the 1930s. After Hitler returned to Berlin in 1945, Goebbels' ministry was destroyed by an Allied air raid on 13 March, and Goebbels had great difficulty disseminating propaganda. In April 1945, he finally bested the rival agencies and took full charge of propaganda, but by then the Soviet Red Army had already entered Berlin. Goebbels was an astute observer of the war, and historians have exhaustively mined his diary for insights on how the Nazi leadership tried to maintain public morale."]}, {"page": "Frederick III, German Emperor", "response": ["Frederick and Victoria were great admirers of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband. They planned to rule as co-monarchs, like Albert and Queen Victoria, and to reform what they saw as flaws in the executive branch that Bismarck had created for himself. The office of Chancellor, responsible to the Emperor, would be replaced with a British-style cabinet, with ministers responsible to the Reichstag. Government policy would be based on the consensus of the cabinet. Frederick \"described the Imperial Constitution as ingeniously contrived chaos.\"Balfour, p. 69. According to Michael Balfour:", "Frederick believed a state should not act against the popular opinion of its inhabitants.Dorpalen, p. 22. He had a long history of liberalism, and had discussed his ideas and intentions with Victoria and others before his reign. Admiring Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the British parliamentary system,Dorpalen, p. 3. Frederick and his wife planned to rule as co-monarchs and liberalize Germany through the appointment of more liberal ministers.Farago, p. 264. They intended to severely limit the office of Chancellor, and reorganize Germany to include many elements of British liberalism. Many historians, including William Harbutt Dawson and Erich Eyck, consider that Frederick's early death put an end to the development of liberalism within the German Empire. They believe that, given a longer reign and better health, Frederick might indeed have transformed Germany into a more liberal democratic country, and prevented its militaristic path toward war.Chalat, p. 1307.McCullough, p. 403. Dr. J. McCullough claims that Frederick would have averted World War I\u2014and by extension the resulting Weimar Republic\u2014while other historians such as Michael Balfour go even further by postulating that, as the end of World War I directly affected the state of the world's development, the liberal German Emperor might also have prevented the outbreak of World War II.Balfour, p. v. Author Michael Freund states outright that both world wars would have been averted had Frederick lived longer.Freund, p. 9.  Frederick's life inspired historian Frank Tipton to speculate: \"What would have happened had his father died sooner or if he himself had lived longer?\"Tipton, p. 176."]}, {"page": "University of East Anglia", "response": ["UEA has benefited from the services of academics at the top of their fields, including Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson who co-founded the MA in Creative Writing programme;\u2018BRADBURY, Sir Malcolm (Stanley)\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014\u2018WILSON, Sir Angus (Frank Johnstone)\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Hubert Lamb who founded the Climatic Research Unit; Lord Zuckerman who was influential in the establishment of the School of Environmental Sciences; Nobel Prize\u2013winning chemist Richard Synge; scientists Sir David King,\u2018KING, Sir David (Anthony)\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Sir David Baulcombe,\u2018BAULCOMBE, Prof. Sir David (Charles)\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Jenni Barclay, Tom Wigley, Godfrey Hewitt, Michael Balls, Andrew Watson,\u2018WATSON, Prof. Andrew James\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Christopher Lamb,\u2018LAMB, Prof. Christopher John\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Alan Katritzky,\u2018KATRITZKY, Prof. Alan Roy\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Jean Palutikof, Michael Gale,\u2018GALE, Michael Denis\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Roy Markham,\u2018MARKHAM, Roy\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Geoffrey Boulton,\u2018BOULTON, Prof. Geoffrey Stewart\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Johnson Cann,\u2018CANN, Prof. Johnson Robin\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Hans Joachim Schellnhuber,\u2018SCHELLNHUBER, Prof. Hans Joachim, (John)\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 John Alwyne Kitching,\u2018KITCHING, John Alwyne\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Thomas Bennet-Clark,\u2018BENNET-CLARK, Thomas Archibald\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132014 Jeremy Greenwood,\u2018GREENWOOD, Dr Jeremy John Denis\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Tracy Palmer and Sophien Kamoun; mathematician Peter Chadwick; writers Angela Carter and Sarah Churchwell; poet George Szirtes; poet laureate Sir Andrew Motion\u2018MOTION, Sir Andrew\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 historians Sir Richard Evans, Paul Kennedy, Patricia Hollis\u2018HOLLIS OF HEIGHAM\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 and Michael Balfour; art historians Peter Lasko and Eric Fernie; historian Stephen Church; philosophers Martin Hollis\u2018HOLLIS, Prof. (James) Martin\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132007 and Andreas Dorschel;\u2018DORSCHEL, Prof. Andreas\u2019, K\u00fcrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender 2014.
