From its very first advertising campaigns, developed together with Emanuele Pirella, the brand developed a pioneering concept in an area where advertising aimed at plus-size women was nonexistent.

Marina Rinaldi was the first to introduce the Italian expression taglia comoda (\u201cplus-size\u201d, literally, \u201ccomfortable size\u201d), replacing the traditional term taglia forte (\u201coutsize\u201d) which had been used until then to describe this type of product.

In June 2009, she went to New York where she was rejected by IMG Models and several other agencies because casting directors thought her looks would not translate well on and off the runway, except for one: Marilyn Agency. At just 15, she was hand-selected by Steven Meisel after finding a video of her on Models.com and booked her for Vogue Italia, her first job. Her runway debut was at the Spring 2010 New York Fashion Week walking for Cynthia Steffe. Wixson then went to Milan where she opened the spring 2010 Prada show and then closed for Miu Miu in Paris, both as exclusives, thus making her one of the most successful newcomers that season. By September, W editor Stefano Tonchi ran a full-page close-up of her lips and the gap in her teeth, her two most arresting features, in his first issue of W magazine. She then became the face of Miu Miu's Spring 2010 campaign shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. A press release about the campaign called her the \"embodiment of a free-spirit on the cusp of womanhood\" (she would stay with the brand for a two-season run). But, Wixson has her limits in what she models, during a W editorial shoot titled \"Run of Show\" shot by Craig McDean she requested a bra because her top was see-through, W notes that a lot of models wouldn't have done that. Photographer Gabrielle Revere  was commissioned by LIFE magazine to photograph Wixson as she worked at New York Fashion Week. The story chronicles the life of how a 15-year-old teen model navigates her way through fittings, hair, makeup and the runway. A selection of 10 unpublished photographs from the LIFE magazine shoot were displayed at Sotheby's in Photographer Gabrielle Revere\u2019s  exhibition  titled \"I Remain, You Desire\" in 2010.
