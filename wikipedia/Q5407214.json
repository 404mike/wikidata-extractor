Back in England he was posted to 23 (F) Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill in 1936, and 213 Squadron at Northolt. Northolt was to see the end of his flying career, because on 12 April 1937 he suffered a serious flying accident that left him with extensive third-degree burns and a 6-month spell in hospital. It was not, however, the end of his RAF career, which up to now had been unremarkable. When World War 2 broke out the following year he reported to his old station Biggin Hill, where, with his recent active flying experience, he was invaluable as a controller. By the summer of 1940 he had become a squadron leader, and a legend in the Control Room, a legend much enhanced by the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau affair. Coming on duty at 7a.m. on 12 February 1942, he noticed aircraft movements seaward of the French port of Brest that the previous controller had dismissed as air-sea rescue, but that he deduced must have been escorting capital ships because of their speed.
