The migrants settled in areas already established by the Sylheti expatriate community, working in the local docks and Jewish tailoring shops set up to use cotton produced in British India. During the 1970s, this immigration increased significantly. Today, Bangladeshis form the largest minority population in Tower Hamlets, constituting 32% of the borough's population at the 2011 census; the largest such community in Britain. The contribution of Bangladeshi people to the culture of Britain was recognised in 1998, when Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin of Bethnal Green became the first Bangladeshi-born Briton to enter the House of Lords and the first Muslim peer to swear her oath of allegiance in the name of her own faith."]}, {"page": "Pola Uddin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin"]}, {"page": "Pola Manzila Uddin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal", "response": ["* Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin faced a police investigation for alleged fraud for claiming at least \u00a3180,000 in expenses by designating an empty flat, and previously an allegedly non-existent property as her main residence.
