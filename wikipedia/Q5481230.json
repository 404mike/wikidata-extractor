He was born in Catshill.\nHarris began his football career at non-league sides Cradley Heath and Bromsgrove Rovers while working as a mechanic. In 1928, he signed for Cardiff City, scoring on his home debut in a 2\u20131 win over Leicester City. It took him several years to fully establish himself in the side as numerous minor injuries forced him in and out of the first team before missing just two games during the 1931\u201332 season. In 1933, he was sold to Charlton Athletic, who were also suffering from a slump in recent years but Harris was part of the team that helped the club win two consecutive promotions to return to the top flight. After leaving Charlton he played at Brierley Hill Alliance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Harris", "response": ["*Francis Harris (born 1908), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Frank Harris (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Francis Harris or Frank Harris (born 1908), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Ferguson scored his 15th league goal of the campaign to help his side to a 2\u20131 win over Birmingham on 22 February and was on target again three days later in a 2\u20130 win over Manchester United, both played at Ninian Park. However, the club's lacklustre form in away matches continued as they lost 3\u20130 to 21st place Portsmouth on 3 March. The travelled to Tottenham two days later and, despite being under pressure for long spells in the game, held out until conceding the only goal of the match shortly before the final whistle. Curtis became the third first team departure to raise funds after the game, joining Birmingham. Stewart made several signings from non-league sides to compensate for the sales, with Matt Robinson, Tom Helsby, William Roberts and Francis Harris all arriving by the end of the season, although none featured for the senior team during the campaign."]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Still limited by a lack of funds, manager Fred Stewart had signed several players from non-league sides during the final months of the previous season, such as Matt Robinson, Tom Helsby, William Roberts and Francis Harris, who formed part of the first team for the 1928\u201329 season. In an attempt to improve the club's goalscoring record, Stan Davies was signed from fellow First Division side Birmingham. Two others, Leslie Jones and Emlyn John also arrived from nearby Welsh sides Aberdare Athletic and Mid Rhondda respectively. Cardiff had undertaken a tour of Denmark at the end of the previous season and had shown interest in signing Creutz Jensen, who had impressed the club's delegation in one match. The board secured his signing on a free transfer but he was denied a work permit by the Ministry of Labour and the move, which would have seen him become the first foreign player in the club's history, subsequently collapsed.", "Cardiff gained their second away point of the season in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United on 13 October with George McLachlan scoring his first goal of the season. With Ferguson absent, Cardiff struggled in front of goal, losing back-to-back fixtures 1\u20130 against Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday and dropping into the bottom six in the table despite possessing one of the best defensive records in the division. Stewart experimented with William Shaw, Francis Harris and Stan Davies in Ferguson's place but all were quickly replaced. Ferguson returned in a 1\u20131 draw with Arsenal, with Tom Sloan scoring his first league goal for the club. However, Sloan also succumbed to injury after the game and, like Nelson, would appear in only two further league matches for the rest of the season. Ferguson appeared in two further games, a 1\u20130 defeat to reigning league champions Everton and a goalless draw with Huddersfield Town, before again dropping out of the first team due to injury."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Goalscoring proved an increasing issue for the side; in their next three fixtures Cardiff scored only once, Francis Harris adding his third goal of the season during a 1\u20130 victory over Barnsley on 19 October. Either side of the win, they suffered defeats, first against Blackpool and later Bradford Park Avenue. This prompted Stewart to make several changes to his side, with George McLachlan, Albert Miles and Billy Thirlaway all restored to the starting line-up. The trio all made an impact as Cardiff defeated West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132 on 2 November, with Miles and Thirlaway scoring either side of Len Davies. Miles scored again a week later, during a 2\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur, as Cardiff recorded consecutive victories for the first time during the campaign. He opened the scoring before Matt Robinson scored the winning goal with his first for the club. Their winning form extended to a third match, a 5\u20132 victory over Southampton in which Thirlaway scored a hat-trick at Ninian Park, before a defeat to Millwall broke the streak by recording a 2\u20130 win on 28 November."]}]}}
