Since 2011 he has written and presented a series of programmes for BBC Four, including Lost Kingdoms of South America, Lost Kingdoms of Central America, Easter Island: Mysteries of a Lost World, Masters Of The Pacific Coast: The Tribes Of The American Northwest, and The Inca: Masters of the Clouds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jago", "response": ["* Jago Cooper (born 1977), English archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Old Bryanstonians", "response": ["* Jago Cooper (born 1977), archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Jago (name)", "response": ["*Jago Cooper (born 1977), British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Man on Earth", "response": ["Man on Earth is a four-part British documentary television series presented by Tony Robinson.

Accompanying Robinson to help explain the science are archaeologist Dr. Jago Cooper and climate modeller Dr. Joy Singarayer."]}, {"page": "Nazario Collection", "response": ["In 2012, research on the pieces returned to the mainstream academia with the involvement of  Reniel Rodr\u00edguez Ramos from the University of Puerto Rico at Utuado, who was concerned that up to that point most of the local research had been carried by historians. During his first visit to the ICP, he encountered part of the Collection being repurposed and the rest in storage.  While attending an activity in the British Museum in 2014, Rodr\u00edguez took some pieces with him to the cuneiform exhibit, where he was casually presented to C.B.F. Walker while showing Jago Cooper a copy of Hostos' letter to the now-retired cuneiform expert. None of the present gave a definitive answer to their nature, but agreed that further study was needed. Parallel to this process, a documentary began being prepared by cinematographer Carlos Garc\u00eda in collaboration with Rodr\u00edguez and his team."]}]}}
