He signed for Chester City in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the Football League and later the Football Conference. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the Conference League Cup in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with Leigh RMI, he played for a host of non-league clubs including Northwich Victoria, Stalybridge Celtic, and Southport.\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the Atlanta Silverbacks, he signed for USL Second Division club Wilmington Hammerheads in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the USL First Division in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join Scottish First Division club Queen of the South. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club Ljungskile in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the Superettan side.\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for Miami FC who later change their name to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in Soccer Bowl 2011, in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the North American Soccer League. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to Soccer Bowl 2013 despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with National Premier Soccer League club Georgia Revolution in 2014, he retired from competitive football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haydock", "response": ["*Martyn Lancaster footballer"]}, {"page": "Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)", "response": ["*  Martyn Lancaster (2011)"]}, {"page": "Terry Smith (football)", "response": ["In Smith's four months and 21 league matches in charge of team affairs, Chester managed wins against Brighton & Hove Albion, Shrewsbury Town and others, but lost 5\u20131 and 4\u20131 to Leyton Orient and Carlisle United respectively, and required a replay to overcome non-league minnows Whyteleafe in the FA Cup.
