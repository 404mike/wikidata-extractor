In the film, it is retroactively established by Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan (with  acknowledgements from the franchise's co-creator Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis' family as canon), that Egon fathered his daughter Callie in 1982 before the events of the first film, whom that even Peter and Ray apparently are unaware of except Janine. However, he became estranged from his family. Callie then became resentful towards her father, and blames his life as a scientist is the cause of him abandoning her. Despite the Ghostbusters successfully closing the \"Manhattan Crossrip of '84\", Egon had come to believe that Gozer would attempt to return again (revealed later because he discovered prophecies of it), but his insistence that the Ghostbusters prepare strained their relationship (a nod to the real-life estrangement between Ramis and Bill Murray after their collaboration in the film Groundhog Day). Ten years after the Manhattan Crossrip (thus five years after the \"Vigo Incident of '89\" and three years after the second incident of 1991 as seen in Ghostbusters: The Video Game if it still canonical), Egon stole equipment and the Ecto-1, and moved to Summerville, Oklahoma, where Ivo Shandor had mined the selenium used to build the Shandor Apartments building back in New York City, and had built another gateway for Gozer. Egon spent years preparing to stop Gozer's eventual return, building energy cannons with the parts of the proton packs to barricade the portal with crossed streams and setting a ghost trap-field for Gozer on his property, and in the process, earning the nickname \"Dirt Farmer\" by Summerville's residents because of his eccentricity and not growing anything on his land. At some point, he added a taser to his PKE meter for defense against spectral entities sent by Gozer. He is revealed to be a collector of strange artifacts like a death whistle from the Aztec culture and Gozerian Sentinel figurines, and still eating junk food.

Having just finished film school recently, Kenan had been having several meetings with film producers for a while, but he hadn't found any success, with a screenplay based on the Pac-Man video game series going unproduced. After Kenan received Dan Harmon's and Rob Schrab's Monster House screenplay for ImageMovers, Kenan had a meeting with the head of story Bennett Schneir, where he was able to pitch his vision for the film. Schneir worked for Robert Zemeckis as the head of development at ImageMovers, and Kenan had a meeting with Zemeckis quickly thereafter, apparently due to the filmmakers wanting to get a director for the project as fast as they could. Upon impressing Zemeckis with his pitch, Kenan then had a meeting with Steven Spielberg, meeting during which he pitched the film to Spielberg in a presentation with some sketches and drawings he had drawn before meeting Zemeckis. By 2004, the studio put the film in turnaround, to which Sony Pictures picked up the project and began production on August 23 of that year.", "Roger Ebert gave the film his highest ranking of four stars calling it \"one of the most original and exciting animated movies I've seen in a long time\" and compared it to the work of Tim Burton.

A scary, sharp, funny movie, this is the best kids\u2019 flick of the year so far.\" Jane Boursaw of Common Sense Media also gave it 4 stars out of 5, saying \"This is one of those movies where all the planets align: a top-notch crew (director Gil Kenan; executive producers Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis), memorable voices that fit the characters perfectly; and a great story, ingenious backstory, and twisty-turny ending.\" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel also gave the film four stars out of five, saying \"This Monster House is a real fun house. It's a 3-D animated kids' film built on classic gothic horror lines, a jokey, spooky Goonies for the new millennium.\" Scott Bowles of USA Today gave the film a positive review, saying that \"The movie treats children with respect.

Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote, \"It's engineered to scare your pants off, split your sides and squeeze your tear ducts into submission.\" Michael Medved called it \"ingenious\" and \"slick, clever [and] funny\" while also cautioning parents about letting small children see it due to its scary and intense nature, adding that a \"PG-13 rating would have been more appropriate than its PG rating.\"Michael Medved: Movie Minute  A.
