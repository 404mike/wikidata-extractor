A chauffeur was killed driving in a convoy of journalists, and three more were injured. At 1:05 pm local time on the following day, 1999, 10 civilians were killed when NATO bombers mounted a daylight raid on a bridge over the Great Morava river in Varvarin. The streets and bridge had more people than usual as Trinity Sunday was observed that day. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance had bombed a \"legitimate designated military target\".", "From the very beginning of Operation Allied Force, minimizing civilian casualties was a major declared NATO concern. According to NATO, consideration of civilian casualties was fully incorporated into the planning and targeting process. All targets were \"looked at in terms of their military significance in relation to the collateral damage or the unintended consequence that might be there,\" General Shelton said on April 14: \"Then every precaution is made...so that collateral damage is avoided.\" According to Lt. Gen. Michael Short, \"collateral damage drove us to an extraordinary degree...[and] committed hours of [my] day dealing with the allies on issues of collateral damage.\" \"There is always a cost to defeat an evil,\" said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, \"It never comes free, unfortunately. But the cost of failure to defeat a great evil is far higher.\" He insisted NATO planes had bombed only \"legitimate designated military targets,\" and if more civilians had died it was because NATO had been forced into military action. He then defended this notion by stating, \"NATO does not attack civilian targets, we attack exclusively military targets and take every precaution to avoid inflicting harm on civilians.\""]}, {"page": "Shea", "response": ["* Jamie Shea (born 1953), NATO official"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Waltham Forest", "response": ["* Jamie Shea"]}, {"page": "List of Lincoln College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Jamie Shea (born 1953) \u2014 NATO spokesman"]}, {"page": "Grassroot Diplomat", "response": ["Out of the ashes of the Arab Spring and London riots, Grassroot Diplomat was officially founded in 2013 to be the link between governments and civil society so that reciprocity is enhanced to better improve diplomatic actions and relations around the world.
