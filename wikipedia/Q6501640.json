The album was produced by Laurie Latham; the sessions took place in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool, following an aborted attempt at recording the tracks without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording was more difficult than the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy. Three singles were issued: \"The Game\", \"Lips Like Sugar\" and \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\".", "Under the new management of Mick Hancock, Duran Duran's tour manager, the band returned to work in May 1985 with a tour of Scandinavia.

McCulloch had been impressed by the sharp quality of Latham's production on The Stranglers' single \"Skin Deep\".Adams, p. 171 The band met with Latham in Brussels and recorded \"All in Your Mind\", \"Like a Rollercoaster\" and \"Jimmy Brown\", which was renamed \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\". \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\" appeared on the WEA compilation album Songs to Learn & Sing in November 1985, and was released as a single in the same month.
