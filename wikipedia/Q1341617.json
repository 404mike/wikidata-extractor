He became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873, LL.D (St Andrews) in 1878, president of the Geological Society of London (1894\u20131896). He was awarded the Murchison Medal in 1884 and Wollaston Medal in 1906. Woodward was president of the Geologists' Association for the years 1873 and 1874, president of the Malacological Society in 1893\u20131895, president of the Museums Association for the year 1900, and president of the Palaeontographical Society from 1895 (upon the death of incumbent president T. H. Huxley) to his own death in 1921.\nHe published a Monograph of the British Fossil Crustacea, Order Merostomata (Palaeontograph. Soc. 1866\u20131878); A Monograph of Carboniferous Trilobites (Pal. Soc. 1883\u20131884), and many articles in scientific journals. He was editor of the Geological Magazine from its commencement in 1864 and sole editor from July 1865 until the end of 1918. Woodward's collection of shells, manuscripts and casts of fossil vertebrates can be found in the archives of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1906 Henry Woodward"]}, {"page": "Eurypterid", "response": ["In 1865, Henry Woodward described the genus Stylonurus (named and figured, but not thoroughly described, by David Page in 1856) and raised the rank of the Eurypteridae to that of order, effectively creating the Eurypterida as the taxonomic unit it is seen as today. In the work Anatomy and Relations of the Eurypterida (1893), Malcolm Laurie added considerably to the knowledge and discussion of eurypterid anatomy and relations. He focused on how the eurypterids related to each other and to trilobites, crustaceans, scorpions, other arachnids and horseshoe crabs. The description of Eurypterus fischeri by Gerhard Holm in 1896 was so elaborate that the species became one of the most completely known of all extinct animals, so much so that the knowledge of E. fischeri was comparable with the knowledge of its modern relatives (such as the Atlantic horseshoe crab). The description also helped solidify the close relationship between the eurypterids and other chelicerates by showcasing numerous homologies between the two groups.", "Due to these similarities, the xiphosurans and eurypterids have often been united under a single class or subclass called Merostomata (erected to house both groups by Henry Woodward in 1866). Though xiphosurans (like the eurypterids) were historically seen as crustaceans due to their respiratory system and their aquatic lifestyle, this hypothesis was discredited after numerous similarities were discovered between the horseshoe crabs and the arachnids. Some authors, such as John Sterling Kingsley in 1894, classified the Merostomata as a sister group to the Arachnida under the class \"Acerata\" within a subphylum \"Branchiata\". Others, such as Ray Lankester in 1909, went further and classified the Merostomata as a subclass within the Arachnida, raised to the rank of class."]}, {"page": "Pterygotus", "response": ["The largest known species was P. grandidentatus, with the largest known isolated chelicerae fragments suggesting a length of .

Henry Woodward described the fossil in 1886 and named it as the species Edestus davisii, commemorating the man who discovered it. Upon naming H. bessonowi in 1899, Alexander Karpinsky reassigned E. davisii to Helicoprion. In 1902, Charles R. Eastman referred H. davisii to his new genus Campyloprion, but this proposal was never widely accepted. Karpinsky's identification of Edestus davisii as a species of Helicoprion would eventually be upheld by Curt Teichert, who described several more complete tooth whorls from the Wandagee Formation of Western Australia in the late 1930s.left|thumb|IMNH 37899 (\"Idaho 4\"), a Helicoprion davisii (=H. ferrieri) tooth-whorl from the Phosphoria Formation, and the only specimen in the genus with preserved soft tissue|218x218px", "Debates over the identity of Helicoprion's tooth whorl were abundant in the years following Karpinsky's monograph. In 1900, the publication was reviewed by Charles Eastman, who appreciated the paper as a whole but derided the sketch of the supposed life position of the whorl. Though Eastman admitted that the teeth of the whorl were very similar to those of other chondrichthyans, he still supported the idea that the whorl may have been a defensive structure embedded into the body of the animal, rather than the mouth. Shortly after his original monograph, Karpinsky published the argument that the whorl represented a curled, scute-covered tail akin to that of Hippocampus (seahorses). This proposal was immediately criticized by various researchers. E. Van den Broeck noted the fragility of the structure and argued that it was most well-protected as a paired feeding apparatus in the cheek of the animal. A.S. Woodward (unrelated to Henry Woodward) followed this suggestion with the hypothesis that each whorl represented a tooth battery from a gigantic shark. G. Simoens illustrated Karpinsky's various proposals and used histological data to adamantly argue that the whorls were toothed structures placed within the mouth. In 1911, Karpinsky illustrated the whorls as components of the dorsal fins. Reconstructions similar to those of Karpinsky (1899) were common in Russian publications as late as 2001."]}, {"page": "Hibbertopterus", "response": ["Though only represented by two small, jointed and vaguely cylindrical fossil fragments (both discovered in the Portage sandstones of Italy, New York), the species today recognised as H. wrightianus has had a complicated taxonomic history. Originally described in 1881 as a species of plant, the fragmentary fossil referred to as \"Equisetides wrightiana\" was noted to represent the fossil remains of a eurypterid by American paleontologist James Hall in 1884, three years later. Though Hall assigned the species to Stylonurus, that same year British paleontologists Henry Woodward and Thomas Rupert Jones assigned the fossil to the genus Echinocaris, believing the fossils represented a phyllocarid crustacean. The assignment to Echinocaris was probably based on the slightly spinose surface of the fossils, but in 1888 Hall and American paleontologist John Mason Clarke pointed out that no described Echinocaris actually had spines similar to what Woodward and Jones suggested and as such, reassigned the species back to Stylonurus, interpreting the fossils as fragments of the long walking legs. An assignment to Stylonurus was affirmed by Clarke and American paleontologist Rudolf Ruedemann in their influential The Eurypterida of New York in 1912, though no distinguishing features of the fossils were given due to their fragmentary nature."]}, {"page": "Cetiosauriscus", "response": ["The sauropod fossil today known as Cetiosauriscus stewarti was discovered in May 1898 by clay workers in the area around Fletton to the south of Peterborough and east of the Great Northern Railway line. Pits in this region expose the fossil-rich sedimentary rocks of the marine Oxford Clay, which is of middle Callovian age and today regarded as one of the classic geological formations of British palaeontology. The sauropod fossil possibly stems from NPBCL pit No.1, which was the northernmost pit operated by the New Peterborough Brick Company Limited, and which produced the most vertebrate fossils. The discovery was brought to the attention of Leeds, who, after excavation, took the sauropod specimen to Eyebury, the Leeds' family home. In mid-August, after some cleaning and repairing of the specimen, geologist Henry Woodward visited Eyebury and produced a life-sized drawing of the remains for presentation at the British Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting. Following this presentation, on 17 August 1898, Henry Woodward returned with American palaeontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who considered the sauropod to be closely related to the North American taxon Diplodocus. Alfred Leeds offered the sauropod to the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH, now abbreviated as NHMUK) for \u00a3250, which would equate to about \u00a330,529 in 2017. The NHMUK had earlier in 1890 and 1892 bought the First and Second Collections of Alfred Leeds, respectively. Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the NHMUK, had \"great pleasure\" to recommend to the Trustees of the NHMUK the fossil be purchased. The purchase was sanctioned on 25 February 1899, along with the purchase of assorted other remains for just over \u00a3357 (~\u00a343,596 now), where the Leeds sauropod gained the accession number BMNH R3078 (now NHMUK R3078)."]}, {"page": "Lexovisaurus", "response": ["In the early 1880s collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds acquired a skeleton of a dinosaur excavated at a small brick pit at the hamlet of Tanholt, close to Eye, Cambridgeshire.
