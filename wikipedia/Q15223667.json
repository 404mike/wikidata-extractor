He fought in the Anglo-Zulu war and during the Battle of Isandlwana was one of only a few British officers to survive; in fact he was the only British front line survivor. Afterwards he wrote a dramatic report on the battle and several letters home that described it further. After the Zulu war he saw service in Afghanistan, Aldershot and Egypt. The letters he wrote during the Zulu war were posthumously published in the book The Curling letters of the Zulu War: \"there was an awful slaughter\" (2001) co-authored by Adrian Greaves and Brian Best.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Isandlwana", "response": ["Of the 1,800-plus force of British troops and African auxiliaries, over 1,300 were killed, most of them Europeans, including field commanders Pulleine and Durnford. Only five Imperial officers survived (including Lieutenant Henry Curling and Lieutenant Horace Smith-Dorrien), and the 52 officers lost was the most lost by any British battalion up to that time. Amongst those killed was Surgeon Major Peter Shepherd, a first-aid pioneer.Aged 37, from Leochel Cushnie, Aberdeenshire, who together with Colonel Francis Duncan had established the concept of teaching first-aid skills to civilians and had written the book \"Aids for cases of Injuries or Sudden Illness\"., BMJ 1994; 309 : 1718 (Published 24 December 1994) The earliest days of first aid. The Natal Native Contingent lost some 400 men, and there were 240 lost from the group of 249 amaChunu African auxiliaries.Thompson, Paul Singer.

Perhaps the last to die was Gabangaye, the portly chief of the amaChunu Natal Native Contingent, who was given over to be killed by the udibi (porter or carrier) boys. The captured Natal Native Contingent soldiers were regarded as traitors by the Zulu and executed.Lock, pp. 223\u201324."]}, {"page": "Royal Field Artillery", "response": ["*Henry Curling, sole British front line officer to survive the Battle of Isandlwana"]}, {"page": "List of people from Thanet", "response": ["*Henry Curling (1847\u20131910), Royal Artillery officer, one of only five British officers to survive the Battle of Isandlwana (1879) "]}, {"page": "Curling (surname)", "response": ["* Henry Curling (1847\u20131910), British Army officer"]}]}}
