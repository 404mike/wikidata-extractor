He was principal harpist of the London Symphony Orchestra, a founding member of the Melos Ensemble, and a harp teacher at the Royal Academy of Music. Many composers wrote music for him. From 1959 onwards, Ellis had a close professional partnership with Benjamin Britten that lasted to the latter's death. He often first performed and recorded Britten's works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Britten", "response": ["Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Osian Ellis and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.", "Britten's close friendship with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964\u201371). String quartets featured throughout Britten's composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The Second Quartet, from 1945, was written in homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten's most important instrumental work to that date. Referring to this work, Keller writes of the ease with which Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves \"the modern sonata problem \u2013 the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject\". Keller likens the innovatory skill of the Quartet to that of Walton's Viola Concerto.Keller, Hans. \"Benjamin Britten's Second Quartet\", Tempo, March 1947, pp. 6\u20139  The third Quartet was Britten's last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, \"one of Britten's greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bart\u00f3k and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling.Anderson, Colin, \"Britten \u2013 'Phantasy Quartet'; String Quartet No. 3; Bliss \u2013 Oboe Quintet\", Fanfare, March 2007, pp. 87\u201388. The Gemini Variations (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year. For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in The Times described as \"a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy\".Chissell, Joan. \"Little Masterpieces\", The Times, 26 June 1976, p. 11 Nocturnal after John Dowland (1963) for solo guitar was written for Julian Bream and has been praised by Benjamin Dwyer for its \"semantic complexity, prolonged musical argument, and philosophical depth\"."]}, {"page": "Aldeburgh Festival", "response": ["Peter Pears, in addition to his role as joint Artistic Director, was a regular performer, often accompanied by Britten, and often appearing in up to ten concerts during the Festival.Concert Programmes.
