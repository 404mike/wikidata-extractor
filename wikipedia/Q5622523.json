His great-grandfather Thomas Paget, of Lubenham, was a banker and represented Leicestershire in Parliament while his great-uncle, also named Thomas Paget, represented Leicestershire South and Harborough. Paget sat as Member of Parliament for Bosworth from 1922 to 1923.\nDuring the 1922 general election campaign, Paget stood on an anti-German platform. Historians such as M.S.R. Kinnear have suggested that this position resonated with the Bosworth electorate. He gained 40.9% of the vote.Paget also wrote historical biographies of Medieval women, The Rose of Raby (about Cecily Neville), The Rose of London (about Jane Shore) and The Rose of Rouen (about Elizabeth Woodville).Paget died in March 1952, aged 65. His son Reginald was also a politician, for the Labour Party.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Guy Paget"]}, {"page": "The Daughter of Time", "response": ["The novel also explores and pastiches different types of historical writing.
