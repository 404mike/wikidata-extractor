The Registrar is also the \"principal adviser on strategic policy\" to the university's Vice-Chancellor and Council (its main decision-making body). Other duties include oversight of \"the University's external relations\", responsibility for \"communications which express the general policy of the University\", and control of the university's records and publications. Before 1997, when amendments were made to set out the modern duties of the post, the statutes relating to the Registrar were predominantly an outdated list of record-keeping duties; a requirement for the Registrar to live in an official residence provided by the university was deleted at this time.
