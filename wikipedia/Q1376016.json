The British historian Antony Beevor noted the \"sinister\" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: \"The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower\" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed SMERSH). On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to Verdun, and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice. Richard Overy addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is \"easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,\" to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to \"distort our view of the Soviet war effort.\"Overy, Richard. Russia's War (New York: 1997), 201.

We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all \u2013 it's true \u2013 felt better. Yes, we felt better.\""]}, {"page": "Blitzkrieg", "response": ["Other historians wrote that blitzkrieg was an operational doctrine of the German armed forces and a strategic concept on which the leadership of the Third Reich based its strategic and economic planning. Military planners and bureaucrats in the war economy appear rarely, if ever, to have employed the term blitzkrieg in official documents. That the German army had a \"blitzkrieg doctrine\" was rejected in the late 1970s by Matthew Cooper. The concept of a blitzkrieg Luftwaffe was challenged by Richard Overy in the late 1970s and by Williamson Murray in the mid-1980s. That the Third Reich went to war on the basis of \"blitzkrieg economics\" was criticised by Richard Overy in the 1980s and George Raudzens described the contradictory senses in which historians have used the word. The notion of a German blitzkrieg concept or doctrine survives in popular history and many historians still support the thesis.", "After the war, Albert Speer claimed that the German economy achieved greater armaments output, not because of diversions of capacity from civilian to military industry but through streamlining of the economy. Richard Overy pointed out some 23 percent of German output was military by 1939. Between 1937 and 1939, 70 percent of investment capital went into the rubber, synthetic fuel, aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Hermann G\u00f6ring had consistently stated that the task of the Four Year Plan was to rearm Germany for total war. Hitler's correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 1943\u20131945, when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the Third Reich."]}, {"page": "Joachim von Ribbentrop", "response": ["On the morning of 3 September 1939, Chamberlain followed through with his threat of a British declaration of war if Germany attacked Poland, a visibly-shocked Hitler asked Ribbentrop \"Now what?\", a question to which Ribbentrop had no answer except to state that there would be a \"similar message\" forthcoming from French Ambassador Robert Coulondre, who arrived later that afternoon to present the French declaration of war.Bloch, p. 260. Weizs\u00e4cker later recalled, \"On 3 Sept., when the British and French declared war, Hitler was surprised, after all, and was to begin with, at a loss\". The British historian Richard Overy wrote that what Hitler thought he was starting in September 1939 was only a local war between Germany and Poland and that his decision to do so was largely based on a vast underestimate of the risks of a general war.Overy, pp. 125\u2013126, in The Third Reich. Ribbentrop's influence caused it to have been often observed that Hitler went to war in 1939 with the country he wanted as his ally, the United Kingdom, as his enemy and the country he wanted as his enemy, the Soviet Union, as his ally.Rees, p. 87."]}, {"page": "Martin Bormann", "response": ["Richard Overy describes Bormann as an atheist."]}, {"page": "Nazi Germany", "response": ["Estimates of the total German war dead range from 5.5 to 6.9\u00a0million persons.

Richard Overy estimated in 2014 that about 353,000 civilians were killed in Allied air raids. Other civilian deaths include 300,000 Germans (including Jews) who were victims of Nazi political, racial, and religious persecution and 200,000 who were murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program.

Nonetheless, despite Nazi Germany's official racism, the extermination of the native populations of the countries of Eastern Europe was not always necessary, because the Racial policy of Nazi Germany regarded some Eastern European peoples as being of Aryan-Nordic stock, especially the local leaders.Hitler's plans for Eastern Europe On March 4, 1941, Himmler introduced the German People's List (), the purpose of it being to segregate the inhabitants of German-occupied territories into categories of desirability according to criteria.Richard Overy, The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia, p. 543\u20134  In the same memorandum, Himmler advocated the kidnapping of children who appeared to be Nordic because it would \"remove the danger that this subhuman people () of the East through such children might acquire a leader class from such people of good blood, which would be dangerous for us because they would be our equals.\"Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius.

In Mason's view in the period between 1936 and 1941, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's \"will\" or \"intentions\" that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship London : Arnold 2000 page 88. Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution. According to Mason, by 1939, the \u201coverheating\u201d of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166 Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless \u201csmash and grab\u201d foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000  page 166 Mason's theory of a \"Flight into war\" being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian Richard Overy over this matter.  Overy maintained the decision to attack Poland was not caused by structural economic problems, but rather was the result of Hitler wanting a localized war at that particular time in history. For Overy, a major problem with the Mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records, that information was passed on to Hitler about the Reich economic problems.Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \u201cDebate: Germany, `domestic crisis\u2019 and the war in 1939\u201d from The Origins of The Second World War edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997 page 102 Overy argued that there was a major difference between economic pressures inducted by the problems of the Four Year Plan, and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserve of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.Overy, Richard \u201cGermany, \u2018Domestic Crisis\u2019 and War in 1939\u201d from The Third Reich edited by Christian Leitz,  Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pages 117-118 Moreover, Overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by Mason."]}, {"page": "World War II casualties", "response": ["|| 3,760,000 to 4,456,000|| 353,000(1942 borders)Richard Overy,  The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940\u20131945 (2013) pp. 304\u20137 (Overy noted that \"No doubt this does not include all those who were killed or died of wounds, but it does include uniformed personnel, POWs, and foreign workers, and it applies to the Greater German area\".
