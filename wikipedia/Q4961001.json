O'Rawe states in his book Blanketmen that Adams prolonged the strike as it was of great political benefit to Sinn F\u00e9in and allowed Owen Carron to win Sands' seat. This was denied by several hunger strikers and Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike. McFarlane states O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states \"We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken. If it was confirmed in writing, we'd have grabbed it . . . There was never a deal, there was never a \"take it or leave it\" option at all\".The Hunger Strikes, pp. 185\u2013186."]}, {"page": "Shankill Road", "response": ["The Greater Shankill and its residents were also subjected to a number of bombings and shootings by Irish republican paramilitary forces. During 1971 two pub bombings took place on the Shankill, one in May at the Mountainview Tavern, at which several people were injured, and a second at the Four Step Inn in September, which resulted in two deaths. A further bomb exploded at the Balmoral Furnishing Company on 11 December that same year, resulting in four deaths, including two infants. Another pub attack followed on 13 August 1975 when the IRA opened fire on patrons outside the Bayardo Bar and then left a bomb inside the crowded bar area, killing four civilians and one UVF member. Brendan McFarlane was given a life sentence for his part in the attack."]}]}}
