Here backed by a small force of Sikh troops, but largely on the strength of his own personality, he completely reformed the administration. He settled local feuds and demolished local fortresses, built roads and canals and encouraged agriculture. The town established by him was named after his death in his honour Edwardesabad, a name which gave way after independence to Bannu, unlike the surviving name of Abbottabad, which commemorates Edwardes's contemporary, General Sir James Abbott.In fact, after Abbott was posted away in April 1853 from Hazara region, Edwardes became the second/next Deputy Commissioner of this district and was responsible for formally naming the region's newly founded town after his predecessor.

He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.Charles Allen, Kipling Sahib, London, Little Brown, 2007 Robert Bulwer-Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the Ridge), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.", "During the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many departments of the government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,Kipling Sahib, London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134 \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip, and intrigue\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Allen", "response": ["Charles Allen may refer to:", "*Charles Allen (Massachusetts politician) (1797\u20131869), American politician and congressman in Massachusetts ", "*Charles Allen (Australian politician) (1833\u20131913), Australian politician and member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly", "*Charles Allen (Stroud MP) (1861\u20131930), English Liberal politician who represented Stroud, 1900\u20131914", "*Charles Allen (D.C. politician) (born 1977), American politician and member of the Council of the District of Columbia", "*Charles Allen (cricketer) (1878\u20131958), English cricketer", "*Charles Allen (hurdler) (born 1977), Canadian hurdler", "*Charles Allen (jurist) (1827\u20131913), American judge in Massachusetts", "*Charles Allen (RAF officer) (1899\u20131974), British World War I flying ace", "*Charles Allen (writer) (1940\u20132020), British writer and historian", "*Charles Allen, Baron Allen of Kensington (born 1957), English businessman"]}, {"page": "Indian Rebellion of 1857", "response": ["The inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably Ferozepore, indecision on the part of the senior British officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi. At the most important garrison, that of Peshawar close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, General Reed, and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May. This decisive act induced many local chieftains to side with the British.Charles Allen, Soldier Sahibs, p. 276.", "The final large-scale military uprising in the Punjab took place on 9 July, when most of a brigade of sepoys at Sialkot rebelled and began to move to Delhi.
