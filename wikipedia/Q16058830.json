He was a partner of J. Heathcoat & Co, lace manufacturers, and also represented Tiverton in the House of Commons between 1868 and 1885. In 1874 he was created a baronet, of Knightshayes Court in Tiverton in the County of Devon.

They had nine children (five sons and four daughters), of whom six reached adulthood. Derick Heathcoat-Amory, 1st Viscount Amory, was their grandson while David Heathcoat-Amory is their great-grandson.

The building was complete by 1874, although not to Burges' original designs, and work had begun on the interior. Unlike Burges' partnership with John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, the relationship between architect and client was not successful, Sir John objecting to Burges' designs both on grounds of cost and style. As Crook (1981) commented, \"Heathcoat-Amory built a house he could not afford to decorate, by an architect whose speciality was interior design\".
