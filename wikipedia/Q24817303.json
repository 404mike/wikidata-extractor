Starring Harvey's wife Nina de Silva and Harvey himself as Petruchio, the production was very much in the style of Poel's own minimalist and authentically Elizabethan productions. Harvey kept Sly on stage throughout, however, in a unique move, he neither incorporated text from A Shrew nor did he have Sly lose interest and fall asleep. Instead, Sly explicitly reacts to the play - laughing at certain points, attempting to climb onto the stage during the wedding before being restrained by his 'wife', and finally succeeding in getting onto the stage later in the play, at which point he shook Petruchio's hand and then introduced himself to Katherina (albeit without dialogue). In an \"extremely conventional production\" at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1919, starring Ethel Warwick and Edmund Willard, William Bridges-Adams stuck rigidly to the First Folio text, but completely removed the Induction and all references to Sly."]}, {"page": "Bachelor's Baby", "response": ["* Ethel Warwick as Mrs. Prowse  "]}, {"page": "Warwick (surname)", "response": ["*Ethel Warwick (1882\u20131951), British stage actress"]}, {"page": "Poison Pen (play)", "response": ["It premiered at Richmond Theatre before transferring to the West End where it ran for 176 performances between 9 April and 19 September 1938, initially at the Shaftesbury Theatre before moving to the Playhouse Theatre and then the Garrick Theatre.
