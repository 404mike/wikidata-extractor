Known as Home Children, the Philanthropic Farm school alone sent more than 1000 boys to the colonies between 1850 and 1871, many of them taken from workhouses. In 1869 Maria Rye and Annie Macpherson, \"two spinster ladies of strong resolve\", began taking groups of orphans and children from workhouses to Canada, most of whom were taken in by farming families in Ontario. The Canadian government paid a small fee to the ladies for each child delivered, but most of the cost was met by charities or the Poor Law Unions."]}, {"page": "Home Children", "response": ["The main pioneers of child migration in the nineteenth century were the Scottish Evangelical Christian Annie MacPherson, her sister Louisa Birt, and Londoner Maria Rye. Whilst working with poor children in London in the late 1860s, MacPherson was appalled by the child slavery of the matchbox industry and resolved to devote her life to these children. In 1870 she bought a large workshop and turned it into the \"Home of Industry\", where poor children could work and be fed and educated. She later became convinced that the real solution for these children lay in emigration to a country of opportunity and started an emigration fund. In the first year of the fund's operation, 500 children, trained in the London homes, were shipped to Canada. MacPherson opened distribution homes in Canada in the towns of Belleville and Galt in Ontario and persuaded her sister, Louisa, to open a third home in the village of Knowlton, seventy miles from Montreal. This was the beginning of a massive operation which sought to find homes and careers for 14,000 of Britain's needy children.", "Maria Rye also worked amongst the poor in London and had arrived in Ontario with 68 children (50 of whom were from Liverpool) some months earlier than MacPherson, with the blessing of the Archbishop of Canterbury and The Times newspaper. Rye, who had been placing women emigrants in Canada since 1867, opened her home at Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1869, and by the turn of the century had settled some 5,000 children, mostly girls, in Ontario.", "The emigration schemes were not without their critics, and there were many rumours of ill-treatment of the children by their employers and of profiteering by the organisers of the schemes, particularly Maria Rye. In 1874 The London Board of Governors decided to send a representative, named Andrew Doyle, to Canada to visit the homes and the children to see how they were faring. Doyle's report praised the women and their staff, especially MacPherson, saying that they were inspired by the highest motives, but condemned almost everything else about the enterprise. He said that the attitude of the women in grouping together children from the workhouses, who he said were mostly of good reputation, with street children, whom he considered mostly thieves, was naive and had caused nothing but trouble in Canada. He was also critical of the checks made on the children after they were placed with settlers, which in Rye's case were mostly non-existent, and said that:"]}, {"page": "Rye, Maria", "response": ["#Redirect Maria Rye"]}, {"page": "Maria Susan Rye", "response": ["#Redirect Maria Rye"]}, {"page": "1829 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 31 March (in England): Maria Rye, social reformer.Dictionary of Canadian Biography"]}, {"page": "Mary M\u00fcller", "response": ["In 1864, she met British women's rights advocate Maria Rye, who was visiting New Zealand.

The Home had been established by the visiting Maria Rye  and the Female Middle Class Emigration Society, which aimed to recruit women in England to go to the colonies as governesses, arrange their passages and find them positions on arrival. However there was concern for the ongoing well-being of these women as they had no family in the colonies. Therefore the Female Home played a key role in providing a safe home for them during periods of unemployment or convalescence, and also served as an employment bureau for local families seeking to hire a governess."]}, {"page": "History of women in Canada", "response": ["In the early 19th century cities, most women were housewives. However, some were employed, chiefly as domestic laborers, unskilled workers, prostitutes, nuns (in Catholic areas), and teachers; a few were governesses, washerwomen, midwives, dressmakers, or innkeepers. The great majority of Canadian women lived in rural areas, where they worked at home, or as domestic servants, until they married and became housewives. British women, such as Maria Rye, set up organizations to help girls and women emigrate to Canada."]}, {"page": "Walter Rye", "response": ["Walter Rye was born on 31 October 1843 in Chelsea, London.
