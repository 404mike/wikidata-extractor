A few days later, Elphick was awarded a two\u2013year contract extension at the club. The day after signing a contract with the club, Elphick made his first league appearance of the season, in a 2\u20131 win over Northampton Town. Elphick's impact in the first team and form earned him praise by Manager Dean Wilkins and formed a partnership throughout the season with Guy Butters and Joel Lynch. From 29 September 2007 to 13 October 2007, Elphick helped the club keep four successive clean sheet in four league matches. In a match against Hartlepool United on 27 October 2007, Elphick was involved in a clash with opposition striker Richie Barker and Barker accused Elphick of \"besmirching the memory of\" Michael Maidens, who died in a car crash weeks ago and following a conclusion to the investigation, he was cleared. However, Elphick suffered a hernia that required a surgery and was sidelined for three weeks, which was soon delayed for another week. Elphick made his return to the first team since returning from injury, in a 3\u20132 win over AFC Bournemouth, in which he stated the game left him bruised and battered. Two weeks later on 19 January 2008, Elphick scored his first professional goal (and his first for the club), in a 1\u20131 draw against Huddersfield Town. Elphick then scored his second goal of the season on 4 March 2008, in a 4\u20132 win over Gillingham. In a match against Nottingham Forest on 24 March 2008, Elphick was given a captaincy armband after their captain Nicky Forster was substituted, which resulted a 0\u20130 draw, in which he said it was honour to wear the captain armband. Then on 11 April 2008, Elphick signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2010. Elphick went on to finish the 2007\u201308 season, making 41 appearances and scoring twice in all competition and was considered to be one of Brighton's best players, winning the 2007\u201308 player of the season award."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 York City F.C. season", "response": ["|Michael Maidens", "!scope=row|Michael Maidens * "]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2007", "response": ["*Michael Maidens, 20, British footballer for Hartlepool United, car accident."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Michael Maidens' Goal of the Season || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Luke James vs Rochdale"]}, {"page": "Michael Douglas Maidens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Maidens"]}, {"page": "Maidens, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Maidens"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 19 January 2007 || MF || Michael Maidens ||York City || 19 February 2007 ||"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["|Michael Maidens"]}]}}
