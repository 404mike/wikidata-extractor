His grandfather, another John Gregg, had sat in the House of Lords as Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, and his uncle, Robert Samuel Gregg served briefly as Archbishop of Armagh in the 1890s after a long episcopate as Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. J A F Gregg went on to be a notable church historian.  He served as assistant curate of Ballymena under Charles d'Arcy 1896\u20131899, then as Curate at Cork Cathedral (1899\u20131906), and as Rector of Blackrock, Co.

In 1915 he became Bishop of Ossory, Ferns and Leighlin, in 1920 Archbishop of Dublin.  He was accompanied by the  Bishop of Cashel Robert Miller and by Protestant businessman Sir William Goulding \"to see Michael Collins in May 1922, following the murders of thirteen Protestants in the Bandon valley, to ask whether the Protestant minority should stay on.
