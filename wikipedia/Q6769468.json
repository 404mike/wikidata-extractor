The loss meant that the Scarlets' run of being the only team not to beat Edinburgh at Murrayfield continued. It took 26 minutes before the first try came for Edinburgh, and it was not long before they added a second. They could have had a third just before half time, but Mark Robertson knocked on in the in-goal area attempting to gather a bouncing ball. The third eventually did come, however, as did a fourth before the midpoint of the second half. A Morgan Stoddart try was sandwiched between Edinburgh's two second half scores, and Martin Roberts crossed with a minute left to play, but it was too little, too late for the Scarlets. They then suffered a second defeat to a Scottish team in as many weeks with a 34\u201320 loss to Glasgow Warriors on 26 September. Despite taking a 12\u20130 lead in the first quarter of the match, the Scarlets found themselves 13\u201312 down at half-time and conceded another two tries before the 60 minute mark. Mark Jones scored a consolation try with eight minutes to go, but it was nullified by a last minute Glasgow try."]}, {"page": "Scottish Olympic medallists", "response": ["|  || Mark Robertson || Rugby sevens || Men's tournament"]}, {"page": "Mark Robertson (Rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Robertson (rugby union) "]}, {"page": "Mark Robertson", "response": ["Mark Robertson may refer to:", "* Mark Robertson (soccer) (born 1977), Australian soccer player", "* Mark Robertson (bassist), American musician and record producer", "* Mark Robertson (rugby union) (born 1984), Scottish rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Robertson (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Robertson (soccer) (born 1977), Australian soccer player", "* Mark Robertson (bassist), American musician and record producer", "* Mark Robertson (rugby union) (born 1984), Scottish rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Mark Robertson (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Robertson (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "Mark Robertson (rugby union born 1984)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Robertson (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["| (GBR)Mark BennettDan BibbyPhil BurgessSam CrossJames DaviesOllie Lindsay-HagueRuaridh McConnochieTom MitchellDan NortonMark RobertsonJames RodwellMarcus Watson"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Glasgow Warriors season", "response": [" Mark Robertson", "*  Mark Robertson from  Scotland 7s", "*  Mark Robertson to  Scotland 7s", "Replacements: Mark Robertson, Nick Grigg**, Robbie Fergusson **, Nyle Godsmark, Ali Price**, Will Bordill, Simone Favaro, Scott Cummings**, Andrew Davidson**, Zander Fagerson, Pat MacArthur, Fergus Scott, George Hunter", "Replacements (all used): George Hunter, Kevin Bryce, Mike Cusack, D'arcy Rae, Scott Cummings**, James Eddie, Will Bordill, Jason Hill, Grayson Hart, Scott Wight, Mark Robertson, Robbie Fergusson**, Junior Bulumakau."]}, {"page": "Scotland Club XV", "response": ["Backs: 15 Mike Adamson (Glasgow Hawks); 14 Mark Robertson (Melrose); 13 Jamie Murray (Melrose); 12 Stewart Smith (Glasgow Hawks); 11 Rory Couper (Boroughmuir); 10 Murray Strang (Glasgow Hawks); 9 Calum Cusiter (Boroughmuir)"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*Keith Robertson and Mark Robertson; Keith is Mark's father"]}]}}
