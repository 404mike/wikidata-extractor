Though The Family Shakespeare was seen as a negative example of censorship by the literary establishment and its commitment to \"authentic\" Shakespeare, the Bowdler editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. According to the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, \"More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler.

Instead, Coleridge's next publication was the monumentally influential Lyrical Ballads co-published with Wordsworth. Lamb, on the other hand, published a book entitled Blank Verse with Charles Lloyd, the mentally unstable son of the founder of Lloyds Bank. Lamb's most famous poem was written at this time and entitled The Old Familiar Faces. Like most of Lamb's poems, it is unabashedly sentimental, and perhaps for this reason it is still remembered and widely read today, being often included in anthologies of British and Romantic period poetry.

Nevertheless, he returned to visit the Wordsworths in Grasmere from time to time.  The Wordsworths were also visited at Dove Cottage by Walter Scott, Humphry Davy, and Charles and Mary Lamb.  In later years, Thomas De Quincey became a long-term guest."]}, {"page": "Edward Armitage", "response": ["Unlike some of his fellow artists, Armitage was not discouraged by his experience of working on the Parliament frescos.  During the summer of 1858 he spent several weeks' research at Assisi, prior to executing frescos (since painted over) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. John the Evangelist, Islington, when his friend the artist George Frederic Watts modelled for the head of an apostle.  Armitage also did frescos at St. Marylebone Parish Church and St. Mark's Church, London, and a monochrome fresco at University Hall, Gordon Square, London, now Dr Williams's Library. This commemorated lawyer and diarist Henry Crabb Robinson surrounded by his most distinguished literary and artistic friends, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Lamb and her brother Charles Lamb, William Blake and John Flaxman. Papered over in the mid-1950s, it originally contained 48 life-size portraits."]}]}}
