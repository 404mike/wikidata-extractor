He remained there three years, and then went in 1580 to Neustadt, from which the professors of Heidelberg had been driven by the elector-palatine because they were not Lutherans.

He is said to have predicted, in one of his sermons (1588), the scattering of the Spanish Armada. He found friends among the citizens, especially in the family of the Cottons, with whom he lived, and whom he taught Hebrew. In 1588 appeared his first work, A Concent of Scripture, dedicated to the queen. John Speed, the historian, saw the book through the press. The Concent was attacked in public prelections by John Rainolds at Oxford, and Edward Lively at Cambridge. Broughton appealed to the queen (to whom he presented a special copy of the book on 17 November 1589), to John Whitgift, and to John Aylmer, Bishop of London, asking to have the points in dispute between Rainolds and himself determined by the authority of the archbishops and the two universities. He began weekly lectures in his own defence to an audience of between 80 and 100 scholars, using the Concent as a text-book. The privy council allowed him to deliver his lectures (as Chevallier had done before) at the east end of St Paul's Cathedral, until some of the bishops complained of his audiences as conventicles. He then moved his lecture to a room in Cheapside, and then to Mark Lane, and elsewhere. Insecurity based on fear of the high commission made him anxious to leave the country."]}, {"page": "John Overall (bishop)", "response": ["John Rainolds pleaded at the Hampton Court Conference for an enlargement of the church catechism of 1549.

This speech, \"related by himself\" to Burghley, was published in 1608, together with a letter to Knollys from his friend, the puritan John Rainolds, in which Bishop Bancroft's sermon at St Paul's Cross (9 February 1588\u20139) was keenly criticised. The volume was entitled \"Informations, or a Protestation and a Treatise from Scotland \u2026 all suggesting the Usurpation of Papal Bishops\". Knollys' contribution reappeared as \"Speeches used in the parliament by Sir Francis Knoles\", in William Stoughton's \"Assertion for True and Christian Church Policie\" (London, 1642). Throughout 1589 and 1590 he was seeking, in correspondence with Burghley, to convince the latter of the impolicy of adopting Whitgift's theory of the divine right of bishops. On 9 January 1591 he told his correspondent that he marvelled \"how her Majestie can be persuaded that she is in as much danger of such as are called Purytanes as she is of the Papysts\". Finally, on 14 May 1591, he declared that he would prefer to retire from politics and political office rather than cease to express his hostility to the bishops' claims with full freedom."]}, {"page": "List of Puritans", "response": ["*John Rainolds"]}, {"page": "William Cole (Dean of Lincoln)", "response": ["He was persuaded to resign the presidency in 1598 in favour of John Rainolds, with whom he swapped jobs, going to be Dean of Lincoln until his death in 1600."]}, {"page": "Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum", "response": ["In the late 16th and early 17th century England, Puritans led a long campaign against theatres, which they considered a source of depravity, culminating with their interdiction in 1642.
