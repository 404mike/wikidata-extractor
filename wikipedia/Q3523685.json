The site contained three sets of structures which contained multiple buildings. Known since the 16th century, Great Zimbabwe had been previously excavated by James Theodore Bent and David Randall-MacIver and controversy raged as to whether the site was the work of Africans (MacIver's view) or of some other civilisation. Caton Thompson assembled an all female expedition for the Zimbabwe excavations, which was the first of its kind. Caton Thompson used ceramics, which were similar to what modern villagers were using, and structures like terrace walls to determine who built the structures from the site. Working with Kathleen Kenyon, Caton Thompson's excavations led her to the unequivocal view that Zimbabwe was the product of a \"native civilisation\". The assertion attracted considerable negative press attention and was received negatively by many within the archaeological community. Caton Thompson claimed to keep hostile letters from local experts in a file marked \"insane\". Modern archaeologists now agree that the city was the product of a Shona-speaking African civilisation."]}, {"page": "Bent (surname)", "response": ["* James Theodore Bent (1852\u20131897), English explorer and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Khor Rori", "response": ["The discovery of Khor Rori / Sumhuram is credited to the English explorer James Theodore Bent, with his wife Mabel, who identified the site during their travels in the region in January 1895.
