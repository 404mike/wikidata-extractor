By October 1987, with no prospect of further appearances (which would have triggered an additional payment to Hamilton) he had walked out on the club and returned to Scotland. Despite being at Chelsea for little over a year, his spell coincided with those of a large number of other Scottish players at the club: Joe McLaughlin, Les Fridge, Billy Dodds, Kevin McAllister, John Millar, Eddie Cunnington, Gordon Durie, David Speedie, Steve Clarke, Doug Rougvie and Pat Nevin."]}]}}
