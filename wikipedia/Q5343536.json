From 1990 he lived in Catalonia, Spain. He spoke French, Catalan, Spanish and English.He was born Edward Hugh Bengree-Jones in Liverpool, and studied at the London School of Economics, but was drawn more to philosophy, science, sociology and literature. His eclectic intellectual pursuits kept him not only from getting a doctorate, but also prevented him from gaining a full-time professorship.By inclination a macroeconomist, his obsession with trying to understand the economic impact of demographic changes often took him far from economics and towards fields like demography, anthropology, biology, sociology and systems theory. In particular his work was centred on the study of demographic changes, migration patterns, and the impact of these on economic growth.In 2014 he published his first book entitled \"\u00bfAdi\u00f3s a la Crisis?\", which discusses the economic situation in Spain. He worked on a book with the provisional working title \"Population, the Ultimate Non-renewable Resource\". Apart from his participation in A Fistful of Euros and his own personal blog, Hugh also wrote regularly for the demography blog Demography Matters. He contributed to the Catalan newspaper Ara and Business Insider.Edward Hugh died on 29 December 2015 of gallbladder and liver cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*29 December \u2013 Edward Hugh, 67, economist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2015", "response": ["*Edward Hugh, 67, British economist, gallbladder and liver cancer."]}]}}
