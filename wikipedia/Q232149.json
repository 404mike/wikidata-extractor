He was a founding contributor, with Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), to the science of thermodynamics, particularly focusing on the first of the three thermodynamic laws. He developed the Rankine scale, an equivalent to the Kelvin scale of temperature, but in degrees Fahrenheit rather than Celsius.\nRankine developed a complete theory of the steam engine and indeed of all heat engines. His manuals of engineering science and practice were used for many decades after their publication in the 1850s and 1860s. He published several hundred papers and notes on science and engineering topics, from 1840 onwards, and his interests were extremely varied, including, in his youth, botany, music theory and number theory, and, in his mature years, most major branches of science, mathematics and engineering.\nHe was an enthusiastic amateur singer, pianist and cellist who composed his own humorous songs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Potential energy", "response": ["The term potential energy was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine,William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) \"On the general law of the transformation of energy,\" Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276\u2013280; reprinted in: (1) Philosophical Magazine, series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, pp. 106\u2013117 (February 1853); and (2) W.

Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, that are called conservative forces, can be represented at every point in space by vectors expressed as gradients of a certain scalar function called potential."]}, {"page": "Conservation of energy", "response": ["In 1850, William Rankine first used the phrase the law of the conservation of energy for the principle.William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) \"On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy,\" Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: (1) Philosophical Magazine, series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, pages 106-117 (February 1853); and (2) W.
