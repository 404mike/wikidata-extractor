Of the more than 400 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named R\u00e9e as one of the half-dozen best male agents.Harry R\u00e9e was born in England, the son of Dr. Alfred R\u00e9e, a chemist who was from a Danish Jewish family, and Lavinia Elisabeth Dimmick, the American-born great granddaughter of chemist and industrialist Eleuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, St John's College, Cambridge, and the Institute of Education, University of London. In 1937 he became a language master at Bradford Grammar School, and later at Beckenham and Penge County School for Boys. In 1940 he married Hetty, daughter of Eardley Vine, of Beaconsfield. They had three children, Janet, Brian and the philosopher Jonathan.\nIn the Second World War R\u00e9e was registered in 1940 as a conscientious objector conditional upon working in the National Fire Service, but in 1941 re-registered for military service and was called up into the army. He later volunteered for the Special Operations Executive, receiving a captaincy in the Intelligence Corps and the codename \"C\u00e9sar\". In April 1943 he was parachuted into France and joined the Acrobat Network around Montb\u00e9liard. Later he became active in the Stockbroker Network around Belfort.\nR\u00e9e spoke against RAF bombing in France, arguing that it was turning French public opinion against the Allies. He suggested that SOE agents could organise effective sabotage of factories on the ground. He organised the destruction of the Peugeot factory at Sochaux by convincing the local director, who was already resisting, to co-operate with SOE. The local director's sabotage was more efficient, and he managed to share tactical information on the Wehrmacht projects they had had to become involved in (especially the [V-1]). On 5 November 1943 R\u00e9e organised a decoy attack on compressors and transformers at Sochaux to transfer the blame. Therefore, the RAF did not bomb the factory.\nThe Germans tried to capture R\u00e9e, who escaped a Feldgendarmerie group after being shot four times and, according to his own account, had to swim across a river and crawl through a forest. He managed to reach Switzerland and still keep some contact with his organisation. In May 1944 he was replaced by an American officer, E.F. Floege, and returned to Britain. He starred in the film Now it Can be Told (aka School for Danger), produced by the RAF Film Unit, which told the story of SOE's activities in France.\nThe Imperial War Museum has an on-line recording of R\u00e9e praising the role of the passive supporters who also risked their lives - In 1951, R\u00e9e became headmaster of Watford Grammar School for Boys. He appeared occasionally on the BBC Television \"Brains Trust\" programme. In 1962 he became the first professor of education at the University of York.R\u00e9e wrote a biography of the educator and inventor of Village Colleges, Henry Morris : Educator Extraordinary: The Life and Achievements of Henry Morris (Longman, 1973) and produced a compilation of Morris' talks and articles, The Henry Morris Collection (Cambridge University Press, 1984). He also wrote The Three Peaks of Yorkshire a walking guide. He died in 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "French Resistance", "response": ["In the summer of 1943, leadership of the FTP-MOI was assumed by an Armenian immigrant Missak Manouchian, who become so famous for organizing assassinations that the FTP-MOI came to be known to the French people as the Groupe Manouchian. In July 1943, the Royal Air Force attempted to bomb the Peugeot works at Sochaux, which manufactured tank turrets and engine parts for the Wehrmacht. The RAF instead hit the neighborhood next to the factory, killing hundreds of French civilians. To avoid a repeat, the SOE agent Harry R\u00e9e contacted industrialist Rudolphe Peugeot to see if he was willing to sabotage his own factory. To prove that he was working for London, R\u00e9e informed Peugeot that the BBC's French language \"personal messages\" service would broadcast a message containing lines from a poem that R\u00e9e had quoted that night; after hearing the poem in the broadcast, Peugeot agreed to co-operate. Peugeot gave R\u00e9e the plans for the factory and suggested the best places to sabotage his factory without injuring anyone by selectively placing plastic explosives. The Peugeot works were largely knocked out in a bombing organised by R\u00e9e on 5 November 1943 and output never recovered. The Michelin family were approached with the same offer and declined.
