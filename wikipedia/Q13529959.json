He was the  Member of Parliament (MP) for Preston in Lancashire from 1903 to 1906.\nKerr, who lived in East Lothian, was the principal owner of Dick, Kerr, and Company Ltd, which carried out large contracts for the construction of tram and cable lines in London, Edinburgh and other cities.He unsuccessfully contested the 1900 general election in his home area of Haddingtonshire. In April 1903 Robert William Hanbury, the Conservative MP for Preston, died aged 58. In the preceding years, Kerr's company had opened extensive tram and electrical equipment factories in Preston, employing nearly 2,000 people, and he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election in May 1903. The Times newspaper reported that he described himself as a firm supporter of the government and as \"a thorough Imperialist, believing the  maintenance of the Empire as a whole to be essential to the prosperity, if not continued existence, of Britain as an independent Power\".  The Liberal Party backed the Labour candidate, trade unionist John Hodge, who had the support of the local temperance movement and reported the defection of many local working-class Conservatives to the Labour cause. However, Kerr won the seat with a majority of 14% of the votes over Hodge, his sole opponent.Kerr held the Preston seat until his defeat at the 1906 general election, after which he did not stand for Parliament again.\nHis daughter, Margot, married the British Army officer and first-class cricketer Henry Baird in 1905.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Kerr", "response": ["John Kerr may refer to:", "* John Kerr (Ohio politician) (1778\u20131823), mayor of Columbus, Ohio", "* John Kerr (Virginia politician) (1782\u20131842), Virginia politician", "* John Kerr Jr. (congress) (1811\u20131879), North Carolina politician and jurist", "* John Kerr, 7th Marquess of Lothian (1794\u20131841), Scottish politician and peer", "* John Kerr (British politician) (1852\u20131925), UK MP for Preston, 1903\u20131906", "* John Kerr, Baron Kerr of Kinlochard (born 1942), British diplomat", "* John Kerr (governor-general) (1914\u20131991), Australian Governor-General", "* John Kerr (Nelson politician) (1830\u20131898), New Zealand politician", "* John Kerr (Auckland politician), New Zealand politician", "* John Kerr (physicist) (1824\u20131907), Scots physicist", "* John Kerr (pathologist) (born 1934), Australian pathologist", "* John Kerr (author) (1950\u20132016), American editor, psychologist", "* John Kerr (Royal Navy officer) (1937\u20132019), British admiral", "* John Kerr (Scottish cricketer) (1885\u20131972), Scottish cricketer from Greenock", "* John Kerr (baseball) (1898\u20131993), American baseball player", "* John Kerr (Australian footballer) (1934\u20132005), Australian rules footballer", "* John Kerr Sr. (1943\u20132011), Scottish-born Canadian soccer player", "* John Kerr (sailor) (born 1951), Canadian sailor", "* John Kerr (footballer, born 1959) (1959\u20132006), English footballer for Tranmere Rovers, Bristol City", "* John Kerr Jr. (soccer) (born 1965), American", "* John Kerr (figure skater) (born 1980), Scottish ice dancer", "* John Kerr (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer", "* John Kerr (singer) (c.1925-2006), Irish ballad singer", "* John Kerr (actor) (1931\u20132013), American actor and lawyer", "* John Kerr (broadcaster) (born 1942), Australian radio broadcaster", "* John Kerr (minister) (1852\u20131920), Scottish minister, sportsman and sporting author"]}, {"page": "Preston (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Kerr"]}, {"page": "Dick, Kerr & Co.", "response": ["W.B.
