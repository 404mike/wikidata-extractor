She became close friends with Lady Elizabeth, who had become destitute after separating from her husband and two sons. Given the bond that developed between the two women (and the difficult position her new friend was in), with the Duke's acquiescence, the Duchess agreed to have Lady Elizabeth live with them. When the Duke began a sexual relationship with Lady Elizabeth, a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois was established, and it was arranged that Lady Elizabeth live with them permanently. While it was common for male members of the upper class to have mistresses, it was not common or generally acceptable for a mistress to live so openly with a married couple. Furthermore, the Duchess had become emotionally dependent on Lady Elizabeth, whom she believed to be her best friend. Having no alternative, she became complicit in the matter. The arrangement among the three is more commonly referred to as a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, but, while the relationship between the Duke and Lady Elizabeth was obviously sexual, there is no concrete evidence of anything beyond emotional dependence, and a particular and open affection, on the part of the Duchess, towards Lady Elizabeth. In one of her letters, the Duchess of Devonshire wrote to Lady Elizabeth, \"My dear Bess, Do you hear the voice of my heart crying to you? Do you feel what it is for me to be separated from you?\" Nevertheless, Lady Elizabeth Foster herself was said actually to envy her and wished for her position. (That Lady Elizabeth shared a love for her was proven at her death years later when a locket, containing a strand of the Duchess's hair, was found around her neck, as well as a bracelet also containing hair of the Duchess on a table beside her deathbed). Lady Elizabeth was reported to have insinuated her way into the marriage by taking advantage of the Duchess's friendship and love and having \"engineered her way\" into a sexual relationship with the Duke. Lady Elizabeth engaged in well documented sexual relations with other men while she was in the \"love triangle\" with the Duke and Duchess.  Among their contemporaries, the relationship between the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Elizabeth Foster was the subject of speculation which has continued beyond their time. The love triangle itself was a notorious topic; it was an irregular arrangement in a high-profile marriage. Lady Elizabeth's affair with the Duke resulted in two illegitimate children: a daughter, Caroline Rosalie St Jules, and a son, Augustus Clifford."]}, {"page": "Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston", "response": ["He was educated at Harrow School (1795\u20131800). Admiral Sir Augustus Clifford, 1st Bt., was a fag to Palmerston, Viscount Althorp and Viscount Duncannon and later remembered Palmerston as by far the most merciful of the three.Ridley, p. 10. Temple was often engaged in school fights and fellow Old Harrovians remembered Temple as someone who stood up to bullies twice his size.

She travelled with her mother and other family to Italy, where she made an agonizing recovery from an illness caused by worms that nearly ended her life.

Work on this building started in 1855, but it was left incomplete for several years and only opened in 1861.  At this time he was engaged in rebuilding work at St. Mary's Church in Thatcham, Berkshire, and designing buildings at Laverstoke Mill in Hampshire. The 1860s saw Hellyer design two Nonconformist chapels on the mainland: one for Wesleyans in Deal, Kent (built in 1864, but no longer extant) and a Congregational chapel in Ringwood, Hampshire (1866). In the same year he designed his second church in Southsea, dedicated to St. Simon.  Both of these are Grade II-listed, as are St. Peter's at Havenstreet and St. Peter's at Seaview. Both are small Gothic Revival-style stone chapels with narrow lancet windows (a characteristic feature of Hellyer's churches); Seaview has been enlarged several times and has lost its spire, but much of Hellyer's work survives, and Havenstreet (where he also designed a parsonage) has a distinctively steep roof topped with a bell-cot. In Ryde during this decade, he altered Westfield Park House, a large villa of 1811, on behalf of its new owner Augustus Clifford\u2014his work included the combined porch and tower at the front, \"evoking Osborne House\"\u2014 and he designed a National school on Green Street (1856\u201357).  This Gothic Revival building has mullioned windows and symmetrical gabled bays; it is no longer in educational use."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Augustus Clifford"]}]}}
