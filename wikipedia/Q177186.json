A mathematics graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was first hired (in 1890) to be an assistant to Edward Walter Maunder, discoverer of the Maunder Minimum, the head of the solar department at Greenwich Observatory. They worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography. They married in 1895. Annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyse the years of sunspot data that Maunder had been collecting at Greenwich. She also designed a small, portable wide-angle camera with a  lens. In 1898, the Maunders traveled to India, where Annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse. By analysing the Cambridge records for both sunspots and geomagnetic storm, they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space, as William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin had declared."]}, {"page": "Edward W.

The presence of oceans was no longer accepted, so the paradigm changed to an image of Mars as a \"dying\" planet with only a meager amount of water. The dark areas, which could be seen to change seasonally, were then thought to be tracts of vegetation. The man most responsible for popularizing this view of Mars was Percival Lowell (1855\u20131916), who imagined a race of Martians constructing a network of canals to bring water from the poles to the inhabitants at the equator. Although generating tremendous public enthusiasm, Lowell's ideas were rejected by most astronomers. The majority view of the scientific establishment at the time is probably best summarized by English astronomer Edward Walter Maunder (1851\u20131928) who compared the climate of Mars to conditions atop a twenty-thousand-foot peak on an arctic islandhartmann, 2003, p. 20. where only lichen might be expected to survive."]}, {"page": "November 1882 geomagnetic storm", "response": ["The event is particularly remembered in connection with an unusual phenomenon, an \"auroral beam\", which was observed from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich by astronomer Edward Walter Maunder and by John Rand Capron from Guildown, Surrey."]}, {"page": "Journal of the British Astronomical Association", "response": ["*Edward Walter Maunder 1890-1894", "*Edward Walter Maunder 1896-1900"]}, {"page": "List of craters on Mars: H\u2013N", "response": ["| Maunder ||  || 107.5 || 1973 || Edward Walter Maunder || "]}, {"page": "Walter maunder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Walter Maunder"]}, {"page": "Maunder (surname)", "response": ["*Edward Walter Maunder (1851\u20131928), English astronomer"]}, {"page": "Solar observation", "response": ["In the second half of the nineteenth century Richard Carrington and Sp\u00f6rer independently noted the migration of sunspot activity towards the solar equator as the cycle progresses.
