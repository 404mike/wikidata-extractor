From there, they paid a visit to the West Indies. On their return to England, Llewelyn Powys suffered a relapse from an old illness, and in the winter of 1936, they went to Switzerland, where she wrote a book of essays, Wheels on Gravel (1938). In 1956, Alyse presented the author Rosemary Manning with a copy of Wheels on Gravel inscribed with a quotation from George Santayana: 'To understand oneself is the classic form of consolation, to elude oneself is the romantic'.Rosemary Manning, 'A Corridor of Mirrors' (London, The Women's Press Ltd., 1987), p.217", "In 1957, Alyse Gregory moved into Velthams Cottage, Morebath, Devon, as the tenant of Mrs Rosamund Mary Rose (n\u00e9e Rosamund Mary Trafford), at a rent of \"one peppercorn a year (if demanded)\". After the sudden death of her landlady on May 12, 1958, Velthams was bought at auction in 1960 by the writer Oliver Stonor, who had known Alyse previously; they were both present at local celebrations in East Chaldon on 7 or 8 May 1945, for the end of the Second World War in Europe, which took the form of a large bonfire near the Five Marys, a local group of prehistoric barrows. In her last years, many friends visited her, in spite of the rural isolation of Morebath, which had a railway station until 1966. Alyse had long been an advocate of voluntary euthanasia, and planned her own. She took a lethal overdose on 27 August 1967, and was cremated in Taunton, Somerset. Her last visitor on the day of her death was the author Rosemary Manning who described the visit in her autobiography A Corridor of Mirrors.Rosemary Manning, 'A Corridor of Mirrors' (London, The Women's Press Ltd., 1987), p.221"]}, {"page": "The God Beneath the Sea", "response": ["It was considered a controversial book at the time of its publication, with critical opinion divided on its merits.
