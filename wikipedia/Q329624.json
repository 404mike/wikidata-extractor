Political scientist Michael Barkun characterized it as \"among the most complex superconspiracy theories\", and also among the most influential due to its popularity in militia circles as well as mainstream bookstores.

In Scared Sacred, Velcrow Ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion. In \"The Planet\", Paul Gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what Judith Butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.", "In Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Kwame Anthony Appiah notes how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, \"at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion\" for valuing others? If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that \"methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment.\" This estrangement entails a \"process of exposure to otherness\" in order to foster \"the irreducible value of diversity within sameness.\" Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness."]}]}}
