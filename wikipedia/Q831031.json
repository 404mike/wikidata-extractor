During the ensuing Ruhrkampf (\"Ruhr struggle\") between the Germans and the French that lasted until September 1923, Britain condemned the French occupation of the Ruhr, and a period of sustained Francophobia broke out in Britain, with Poincar\u00e9 being vilified in Britain as a cruel bully punishing Germany with unreasonable reparations demands. The British\u2014who openly championed the German position on reparations\u2014applied intense economic pressure on France to change its policies towards Germany. At a conference in London in 1924 to settle the Franco-German crisis caused by the Ruhrkampf, the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald successfully pressed the French Premier \u00c9douard Herriot to make concessions to Germany. The British diplomat Sir Eric Phipps who attended the conference commented afterwards that: The London Conference was for the French 'man in the street' one long Calvary as he saw M. Herriot abandoning one by one the cherished possessions of French preponderance on the Reparations Commission, the right of sanctions in the event of German default, the economic occupation of the Ruhr, the French-Belgian railway R\u00e9gie, and finally, the military occupation of the Ruhr within a year. The great conclusion that was drawn in Paris after the Ruhrkampf and the 1924 London Conference was that France could not make unilateral military moves to uphold Versailles as the resulting British hostility to such moves was too dangerous to the republic. Beyond that, the French were well aware of the contribution of Britain and its dominions to the victory of 1918, and French decision-makers believed that they needed Britain's help to win another war; the French could only go so far with alienating the British. From 1871 forward, French elites had concluded that France had no hope of defeating Germany on its own, and France would need an alliance with another great power to defeat the Reich."]}, {"page": "George V", "response": ["In the wake of a world financial crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin,Rose, pp. 373\u2013379Vernon Bogdanor argues that George V played a crucial and active role in the political crisis of August\u2013October 1931, and was a determining influence on Prime Minister MacDonald, in .

Daladier was in favor of continuing arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans as long as the Italian forces were in Spain, but Bonnet argued for ending arms supplies as a way of improving relations with Italy and even told the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, that his country should \"lay great stress with Daladier on the importance to the Pyrenees frontier remaining closed\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936\u20131939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 188 It was Bonnet's hope that ending arms supplies for the Spanish Republic would be reciprocated by a total Italian withdraw from all Spanish territory, especially the Balearics.

In the fall of 1938, Corbin reported to Paris that several right-wing newspapers, most notably the newspaper chain  owned by the Canadian media magnate Lord Beaverbrook, whose flagship paper was The Daily Express, were calling for a peacetime conscription, which he took as a sign that the British public was turning against appeasement. Corbin was following his own agenda in his dispatches as he wanted to convince Daladier and other decision-makers in Paris that the British public and the government were starting to favor \"firmness\" towards the Reich as a way to undercut Bonnet's foreign policy of giving Germany a \"free hand in the East\" in exchange for leaving France alone. Corbin reported that there was a growing demand in Britain for \"if not conscription pure and simple, at least a form of 'national service'\". In November 1938, Corbin reported that one public opinion poll showed that the majority of the British people favored a \"national registry\" of young men. At the same time, Corbin told the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, that there was growing defeatism in France and that Bonnet had his own agenda of reaching an understanding with the Reich that might very well be at Britain's expense. To counter Bonnet, Corbin urged Halifax that Britain should make an effort to stand by France such as making the \"continental commitment\", saying that as long the French believed the British \"would fight to the last Frenchman\", the appeal of Bonnet would continue to grow. On 1 November 1938, Lord Halifax in a dispatch to Sir Eric Phipps, the British ambassador in Paris, stated his fear that France: \"turn so defeatist as to give up the struggle of maintaining adequate forces even for the safety of metropolitan France\". Corbin also urged Paris to confront Chamberlain on the conscription issue, writing: \"Must we wait six months as in 1914 for the 'first hundred thousand' to make their appearance on our soil?\" Corbin was assisted in a way that were not entirely proper by General Sir Henry Pownall, the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence in the British Army, who leaked information to him to assist him with pressuring Chamberlain to make the \"continental commitment\". Corbin's friendship with several anti-appeasement Conservative MPs such as Churchill, Eden, Duff Cooper and Amerey encouraged his tendency to argue for a foreign policy more in tune with the anti-appeasers than with the appeasers.", "In the summer of 1939, Corbin poured so much scorn on a proposal to have Pope Pius XII mediate an end to the Danzig crisis, pointing out the impracticalities posed by having the well-known Germanophile Pontiff serving as a supposedly neutral mediator that Bonnet was forced to give up the idea. During the debates within the French cabinet between Daladier and Bonnet in August 1939 about whatever to go to war with Poland, Corbin strengthened Daladier's hand by reporting that Britain approved of his foreign policy, much to the intense fury of Bonnet who wanted Corbin to report the opposite. On 27 August 1939, Corbin at present at a meeting between Sir Alexander Cadogan, the permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, and the Swedish businessman Birger Dahlerus, who been trying to play amateur diplomat by negotiating an end to the Danzig crisis. Corbin had been worried that Britain was using Daherus to negotiate behind France's back, which was why Cadogan invited him to hear him lecture Dahlerus that Germany's \"gangster policy would have to cease\". On the night of 30 August, the German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop gave Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador in Berlin, the German \"final offer\" demanding that a Polish envoy arrive in Berlin that night to discuss the resolution of the Danzig crisis. Chamberlain called Corbin that night to say he thought Hitler was bluffing and the peace could still be saved. As Italy was not ready for war in 1939 which the offensive alliance known as the Pact of Steel had it committed to, the Italian foreign minister Count Galeazzo Ciano proposed an international conference for 5 September 1939 to be chaired by Mussolini to discuss the Danzig crisis. Lord Halifax asked Corbin for French reaction to the Italian peace plan. Bonnet was in favor of the Italian plan for a conference, but needed the approval of the French cabinet and complained that Daladier refused to call a cabinet meeting to discuss Mussolini's conference. Daladier told Sir Eric Phipps, the British ambassador in Paris that would rather resign than attend the proposed conference, saying it would be a \"second Munich\"."]}, {"page": "European foreign policy of the Chamberlain ministry", "response": ["Chamberlain's initial emphasis on trying to win over potential enemies was partly because of a pessimistic assessment of potential allies.
