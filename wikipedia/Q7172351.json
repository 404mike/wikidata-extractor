In August 1986, the long-awaited new Frankie Goes to Hollywood single, \"Rage Hard\", was released, reaching number 4 in the UK. Initially showcased promotionally with songs like \"Warriors of the Wasteland\", the group's sound had developed a significantly harder edge with a less flamboyant, more nitty-gritty lyrical side. The album, Liverpool, was released in October 1986 and reached UK No.\u00a05. It was generally panned by the music press and chart returns declined rapidly with the follow-up singles \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" (No.\u00a019) and \"Watching the Wildlife\" (No.\u00a028). The group meanwhile threatened to implode of its own accord, in the course of a tour promoting the new album. Johnson kept himself markedly separate from the rest of the band when offstage during this period, tensions becoming exacerbated during a backstage altercation between Johnson and O'Toole at Wembley Arena in January 1987, reflecting the generally collapsing relationship between lead singer and the rest of the band.
