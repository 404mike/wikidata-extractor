Symptoms vary among patients, but other characteristics include a soft, high-pitched voice, partial webbing of the fingers and toes, palate deformations, genital abnormalities, language difficulties, and an aversion to crowds. The pathogenesis of the disease is yet to be identified, and no medical tests can definitively diagnose the disease.  The primary method of diagnosis is to identify facial phenotypes. Since it was first described in 1965 by English physician Victor Dubowitz, over 140 cases have been reported worldwide.

She met the South African-born neurologist Victor Dubowitz on Easter 1960; they were engaged two weeks later and married within three months. Soon afterwards, husband and wife moved to Sheffield, where Lilly took up a temporary registrar post in paediatrics and discovered a strong interest in neonatology, the study of newborns. She began working on newborn research at night while caring for her own four young children during the day. She and Victor collaborated on the development of a tool to estimate the gestational age of a newborn by examining its neurological signs as well as anatomical features. The test, titled the Dubowitz Score, was published in 1970 and was rapidly adopted around the world for distinguishing mature but malnourished babies from premature babies who were appropriately small for their age. In the United States, to perform the test was known as \"Dubowitzing the baby\".", "Lilly and Victor Dubowitz returned to London's Hammersmith Hospital in 1972, where Lilly pioneered the use of cranial ultrasound and, later, magnetic resonance imaging to assess the brains of newborns. In 1980, husband and wife collaborated again to develop a systematic method for the neurological examination of the newborn. Their assessment paid special attention to premature infants, who at the time were widely felt to be impossible to assess.
