Though the Winchester head remained in place, another one appeared at Jumi\u00e8ges; he \"must have clandestinely removed the head, or at least the greater part of it, and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty capsa\".Kelly Chaucer p. 54 Two of the four most important surviving late Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscripts went the same way, thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries.Dodwell Anglo-Saxon Art pp. 224\u2013225 One is the so-called , actually a sacramentary with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures, which bears an inscription apparently in Robert's own hand recording its donation to Jumi\u00e8ges when he was Bishop of London, and the other the so-called , actually a pontifical with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration (respectively Rouen, Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale, Manuscripts Y.6 and Y.7).
