Born in Toulouse he studied law but later turned to the study of art at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He moved to London early in the 20th century and in 1905 received his first commission to illustrate the novels of the Bront\u00eb Sisters. During World War I, Dulac produced relief books and when after the war the deluxe children's book market shrank he turned to magazine illustrations among other ventures. He designed banknotes during World War II and postage stamps, most notably those that heralded the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 22", "response": ["*1882 \u2013 Edmund Dulac, French-English illustrator (d. 1953)"]}, {"page": "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam", "response": ["Hodder and Stoughton (1909), illustrations by Edmund Dulac;", "* The artist/illustrator Edmund Dulac produced some much-beloved illustrations for the Rubaiyat, 1909."]}, {"page": "Brothers Grimm", "response": ["In Germany,  was also released in a \"popular poster-sized  (broadsides)\" format and in single story formats for the more popular tales, such as \"Hansel and Gretel\".

A popular edition that sold well was released in the mid-19th century and included elaborate etchings by George Cruikshank.
