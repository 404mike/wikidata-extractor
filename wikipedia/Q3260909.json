Robinson was a member of the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, which fielded the winning team.  The International Olympic Committee credits him with a gold medal in water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics, but this is incorrect as sources contemporary to the Games indicate that he was in England too soon after the tournament to have been in Paris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "response": ["German sources do not list Hans Aniol, Max Hainle, or Herbert von Petersdorff as members of the Berliner Swimming Club, mentioning Gustav Erpf, Asmus Simonsen, and Max Sch\u00f6ne instead, but Mallon notes that there is proof contemporary to the tournament for the participation of only the former trio. Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romas, Guillaume S\u00e9ron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he \"was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.\""]}, {"page": "Eric Robinson", "response": ["Eric Robinson may refer to:", "* Eric Robinson (conductor) (1908\u20131974), British conductor", "* Eric Robinson (Canadian politician) (born 1953), Canadian politician in Manitoba", "* Eric Robinson (Australian politician) (1929\u20131981), Australian federal politician", "* Eric Robinson (water polo), British water polo player", "* Eric Robinson (veterinarian), South African veterinarian", "* Eric Robinson (ice hockey) (born 1995), American ice hockey player"]}]}}
