Presents line books were more sexually explicit than the previous line, Romance, under which Winspear had been published. She was chosen to be a launch author because she, along with Anne Mather and Anne Hampson were the most popular and prolific British authors of Mills and Boon.In 1970, Winspear commented that she wrote her leading males as if they were 'capable of rape'. This comment caused uproar and led to her receiving hate mail.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mills & Boon", "response": ["The attributes of the heroes of Mills & Boon novels have not significantly changed over time, however, almost always being a dominant alpha male. Joanna Bowring, co-curator of the Mills & Boon centenary exhibition at Manchester Central Library in 2008, notes that \"there's always been a subtle undercurrent of force throughout the books and that's never changed from the earliest ones. Even later, when other aspects are influenced by feminism and the shifting attitudes outside the novel, the men are masterful and stern.\" In 1966, the Mills & Boon author Hilary Wilde said \"The odd thing is that if I met one of my heroes, I would probably bash him over the head with an empty whisky bottle. It is a type I loathe and detest. I imagine in all women, deep down inside us, is a primitive desire to be arrogantly bullied.\" Many critics particularly point to the comments by another of Mills & Boon's writers, Violet Winspear, in 1970, that all her heroes \"must frighten and fascinate. They must be the sort of men who are capable of rape\". Bindel argues that, as heroines have acquired greater agency, the heroes have become even more domineering and misogynistic. Other critics contend that these characters are outdated and inappropriate for modern works. However, supporters of the publisher counter that Mills & Boon are careful to follow their readers' tastes and interests; if the hero follows this trend it is because that is what the readers want."]}, {"page": "Harlequin Enterprises", "response": ["At the time that Harlequin purchased Mills & Boon, the company published only one line of category romances.  Six novels were released each month in this line, known as Harlequin Romance.  At John Boon's urging, in 1973 Harlequin introduced a second line, Harlequin Presents.  Designed partially to highlight three popular and prolific authors, Anne Hampson, Anne Mather, and Violet Winspear, these novels were slightly more sensual than their Harlequin Romance counterparts.  Although Mary Bonnycastle disapproved of the more sensual nature of these novels, they had sold well in Great Britain, and the company chose to distribute them in North America as well.  Within two years the Harlequin Presents novels were outselling Harlequin Romance."]}, {"page": "Anne Mather", "response": ["In 1973, she became a launch author for the new Harlequin Presents line of category romance novels.
