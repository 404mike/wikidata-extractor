Hartson and Kitson gave the team an exciting frontline, whilst in the midfield Redknapp added Eyal Berkovic from Southampton and Trevor Sinclair and Andy Impey from Queens Park Rangers. The team had to contend with the season-long loss of captain Julian Dicks, who had played on the previous year despite needing urgent knee surgery, the sale of Marc Rieper to Celtic and the sale of Slaven Bili\u0107 to Everton. The profit from the sale went to acquire former England under-21s David Unsworth and Ian Pearce from Everton and Blackburn respectively.", "This season marked a change in Redknapp's tactical approach, who adopted a 5\u20133\u20132 formation for most of the season. This allowed Redknapp to blood the young talent of Rio Ferdinand in his preferred role as a sweeper whilst pairing him with two competent defenders. The pacey Stan Lazaridis and Andy Impey took over wingback roles, whilst the centre of midfield was contested by Lampard, Lomas and Berkovic, with Moncur preferred over Ian Bishop in reserve and Michael Hughes out in the cold. In goal, Miklo\u0161ko started the year, but injury curtailed his season (and by the next summer had moved on to QPR), resulting in Craig Forrest stepping in. However, Redknapp also managed to secure Bernard Lama on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, which helped maintain West Ham's late-season push.", "West Ham started the year slowly and by Christmas were facing a crisis. First, the club sold Andy Impey under the nose of the manager, literally removing him from a game in which he was tabled to start,\"Redknapps flare up to Impey's withdrawal (line 23).\" and then made it clear to Redknapp that he would be given no further transfer funds due to the absenteeism of Javier Margas, which was taken to represent Redknapp's continued failure with recruiting foreign talent.\"Redknapps flare up to Impey's withdrawal (line 31).\" John Hartson was found to be involved in a training ground incident involving Eyal Berkovic, and the owners were forced to act\u2014Hartson was sold to Wimbledon FC for \u00a37.5\u00a0million as a result after having an already disappointing start to the year where he did not score until ten games in, and was notably overweight and out of shape.\"Hartson overweight and unfit\"", "At this point Redknapp's relationship with the board, already strained since the Andy Impey incident, fell apart. Redknapp requested a warchest of \u00a312\u00a0million to get the club back into the top six, with a sizeable portion of this to go towards bringing in Paris Saint-Germain left-winger Laurent Robert and a client of football agent and close associate of Redknapp, Willie McKay."]}, {"page": "History of Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["The club relied heavily on decent runs in the cup competitions during these bleak financial seasons, and in 1999\u201300 they progressed to the FA Cup Third Round again. Having disposed of Burgess Hill, York City and Hartlepool United, they drew then Premiership side Leicester City at Edgar Street, which was again a feature match on Match of the Day. Leicester fielded their first team which featured the likes of Tim Flowers, Emile Heskey and Robbie Savage against a Hereford side that featured part-time goalkeeper Mark Jones (a farmer), midfielder John Snape (an electrician) and striker Rob Elmes (a teacher). Hereford forced a replay after a 0\u20130 draw although they came close to winning after Paul Parry, who had come through the youth system at Hereford, shot against the post with Flowers beaten. In the replay at Filbert Street Hereford took a shock lead in the first half through Paul Fewings. Leicester recovered to equalise through Matt Elliott and the match went into extra time. Leicester then went a man down after an injury to Andy Impey but Hereford had tired and could not capitalise on their advantage.
