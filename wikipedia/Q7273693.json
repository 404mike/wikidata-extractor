Scholar R. I. Page says that, while there is no shortage of etymologies for the word, it is tempting to link the word with Old Norse vinr ('friend') and Latin Venus ('goddess of physical love'). Vanir is sometimes anglicized to Wanes (singular Wane).This occurs, for example, in the Henry Adams Bellows translation of the Poetic Edda, cf. Bellows 1923: 10."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Saxon runes", "response": ["The runes above were not included in Codex Vindobonensis 795. Calc appears in manuscripts, and epigraphically on the Ruthwell Cross, the Bramham Moor Ring, the Kingmoor Ring, and elsewhere. Gar appears in manuscripts, and epigraphically on the Ruthwell Cross and probably on the Bewcastle Cross.. The unnamed \u16e4 rune only appears on the Ruthwell Cross, where it seems to take calc's place as /k/ where that consonant is followed by a secondary fronted vowel. Cweor\u00f0 and stan only appear in manuscripts. The unnamed \u0119 rune only appears on the Baconsthorpe Grip. The unnamed \u012f rune only appears on the Sedgeford Handle. While the rune poem and some manuscripts present \u16e1 as \"ior\", and \u16c4 as \"ger\", epigraphically both are variants of ger. R. I. Page designated ior a pseudo-rune..", "There is little doubt that calc and gar are modified forms of cen and gyfu, and that they were invented to address the ambiguity which arose from /k/ and /g/ spawning palatalized offshoots.. R. I. Page designated cweor\u00f0 and stan pseudo-runes, noting their apparent pointlessness, and speculating that cweor\u00f0 was invented merely to give futhorc an equivalent to Q.. The \u0119 rune is likely a local innovation, possibly representing an unstressed vowel, and may derive its shape from \u16e0.. The unnamed \u012f rune is found in a personal name (b\u012frnfer\u00fe), where it stands for a vowel or diphthong. Anglo-Saxon expert Gaby Waxenberger speculates that \u012f may not be a true rune, but rather a bindrune of \u16c1 and \u16a9, or the result of a mistake.."]}, {"page": "Parker Library, Corpus Christi College", "response": ["* R.
