In all competitions Weare made over 600 appearances for Newport County, his only club. Weare was selected for Wales international squads but never attained a full cap.\nWeare died on 21 September 2012. He was 78 years old. A minute's applause was held in his honour at Newport County's match versus Southport on 22 September 2012.\nHe was entered into the Newport County Hall of Fame as part of the Centenary Celebrations at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort. He died weeks before the event but knew about the plans. His family received the award on his behalf.\nHis brother, Jack, was also a footballer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2012 in association football", "response": ["* September 21 - Len Weare, Welsh footballer (born 1934)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Len Weare"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:right;\"|1||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Len Weare||1955\u20131970 || 526 || 0"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["| Len Weare||27 Oct 2012||1955\u20131970||525||0||Posthumous", "*  Len Weare 525"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Len Weare, 78, footballer (Newport County)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2012", "response": ["*Len Weare, 78, Welsh footballer (Newport County)."]}, {"page": "Weare (surname)", "response": ["* Len Weare, Welsh professional footballer"]}]}}
