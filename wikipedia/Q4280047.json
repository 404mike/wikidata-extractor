Brian Capron, who played notorious serial killer Richard Hillman from 2001 to 2003, warned Ford and Ward that the murder plot could harm their careers due to the storyline being so high-profile. Ford promised that it's a fitting end for the Street's resident love rat. \"Charlie has had this smug attitude that he can do whatever he wants and it has just driven Tracy insane,\" she said. \"He lives by the sword and dies by the sword. I don\u2019t think there's a man Tracy\u2019s met who's going to get the better of her.

Tracy, meanwhile, is successfully granted bail following an intense grilling by detectives. She ignores her bail conditions and sneaks to the hospital where she leans over an unconscious Charlie urging him to hurry up and die. \"When Tracy finds out that Charlie hasn\u2019t died straight away she's terrified that he might actually wake up and tell the cops the truth,\" Ford revealed. \"She planned to kill him so knowing he's still alive puts her into a panic. She orders Deirdre to take her to the hospital where she wishes her cheating boyfriend would hurry up and die. It\u2019s a really worrying time for Tracy as she's desperate to cover her tracks and not be charged with murder. Ford added: \"As far as Tracy\u2019s concerned Charlie was trying to kill her and that\u2019s what she has told everybody.
