It was a good experience but results did not go our way and it was hard, when you are at the bottom everything seems to go against you\". He also remarked that the training was less intense than he was used to at Brentford.

Dallas found his minutes on the pitch limited during the early months of 2014, but he broke into the starting lineup in April, starting in six of the Bees' final seven games of the season.
