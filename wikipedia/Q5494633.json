His career with the company began in 1879 and continued with brief interruptions until his death in 1917.\nBillington seldom played in the West End but was a favourite with provincial audiences, chiefly in the roles created by Rutland Barrington. He created two roles in Savoy operas: the first was the Sergeant of Police in the one-off performance of The Pirates of Penzance given in December 1879 in Paignton (the day prior to the New York premiere) to establish Gilbert's and Sullivan's British copyright, and the second was King Mopolio in His Majesty at the Savoy Theatre in 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Sergeant||Fred Billington||Fred Clifton||Rutland Barrington||Rutland Barrington||Walter Passmore", "|Sergeant||Rutland Barrington||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Richard Walker"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Pooh-Bah||Rutland Barrington||Fred Billington||Rutland Barrington||Rutland Barrington||Rutland Barrington", "|Pooh-Bah||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Richard Walker||Richard Watson"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|Sir Despard||Rutland Barrington||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield||Sydney Granville||Sydney Granville"]}, {"page": "1927 in music", "response": ["*November 2 \u2013 Fred Billington, Baritone opera singer and actor with the d'Oyly Carte (b. 1854)"]}, {"page": "Princess Ida", "response": ["|King Hildebrand||Rutland Barrington||Sgr Brocolini||Sgr Brocolini||Fred Billington||Leo Sheffield"]}, {"page": "The Gondoliers", "response": ["!Role!!Savoy Theatre1889Rollins and Witts, p. 12!!New Park Theatre1890G\u00e4nzl, p. 384; the cast at Palmer's theatre was as follows: Duke: Frank David; Luiz: Helier Le Maistre; Don Alhambra: Fred Billington; Marco: Richard Clarke; Giuseppe: Richard Temple; Antonio: O.

In 1920, the critic Neville Cardus wrote of him, \"As fine a Savoyard as any in the company, Mr. Sydney Granville acted and sang capitally.
