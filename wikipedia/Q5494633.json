His career with the company began in 1879 and continued with brief interruptions until his death in 1917.\nBillington seldom played in the West End but was a favourite with provincial audiences, chiefly in the roles created by Rutland Barrington. He created two roles in Savoy operas: the first was the Sergeant of Police in the one-off performance of The Pirates of Penzance given in December 1879 in Paignton (the day prior to the New York premiere) to establish Gilbert's and Sullivan's British copyright, and the second was King Mopolio in His Majesty at the Savoy Theatre in 1897.", "link_mentions": {}}}
