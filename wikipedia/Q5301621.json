The rebel clubs broke away and competed in the London League during the 1941\u201342 season, which led to their expulsion from the Football League. Brentford began the season with a heavily depleted squad, with no goalkeeper available for the entirety of the season and just five of the club's 12 available outfield players made over 30 appearances during the 40-match campaign. Despite 16 goals in 19 appearances and 14 in 24 from returning guest forwards Eddie Perry and Douglas Hunt respectively, Brentford finished 9th of 16 teams in the London League.

Aided by goals from all across the forward line, Brentford finished the group stage as unbeaten leaders. The Bees faced Arsenal in the semi-final at Stamford Bridge and drew 0\u20130. The two teams met again for the replay White Hart Lane a fortnight later, with goals from George Wilkins, Douglas Hunt and a late penalty save from John Jackson ensuring Brentford's passage through to the final versus Portsmouth. The two clubs faced off at Wembley Stadium on 30 May and a brace from Les Smith saw the Bees run out 2\u20130 winners, in what was the Bees' only victory at the old Wembley Stadium. The 69,792 crowd is still the largest attendance at any Brentford match.
