This was significant in that most NASL teams used U.S. players as goalkeepers or bench warmers.  Miller took Bob Rigby with the first pick in the 1973 NASL college draft.  Rigby went on to become one of the best goalkeepers in the NASL.  In the second round, Miller selected Bobby Smith who was selected as a second team All Star his rookie year.  Miller then took his team to England to train.  While there noticed several players who he thought could help his team.  He negotiated an on loan arrangement for Andy Provan, Jim Fryatt and Chris Dunleavy."]}]}}
