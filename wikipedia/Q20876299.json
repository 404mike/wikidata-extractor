As a result, the Southern League Management Committee paid a \u00a3100 subsidy to each of the five English clubs in the league. Of the previous season's professional players, only goalkeeper Ted Price, full backs Tommy Fells and Walter Spratt, centre half Frank Bentley and outside left Patsy Hendren were retained. Bill Smith, Frederick Chapple and Bob McTavish were sold for small fees, while left half Phil Richards elected to retire. In came half backs Tom McGovern, Bobby Jackson and forwards Charlie Elliott, Henry Simons, Joe Johnson and Tommy Clark. England international amateur right half Alec Barclay remained with the club and amateur forwards Henry White and Jack Chapman were added to the ranks.", "As the season got underway, Brentford feasted on poor Welsh opposition, winning 13 of the first 15 matches of the season, scoring 49 goals and conceding just three. Treharris and Ton Pentre were each beaten 7\u20130 at Griffin Park and the Bees also posted 5\u20130, 4\u20130 and 3\u20130 scorelines, each on two occasions. The rot slowly set in after a 1\u20130 home defeat to 2nd-place Croydon Common on Christmas Day 1913 and injuries and the absence of some of the club's amateurs lead to defeats to fellow challengers Luton Town in February 1914, Stoke later that month and a galling 1\u20130 reverse to Ton Pentre on 21 March. Defeat to Newport County at home on 4 April ended Brentford's mathematical chances of a runners-up finish and later that month, with the club unable to pay its players in full, leading scorer Henry Simons and future England international Jack Cock were sold to raise funds. Brentford finished the campaign in 4th-place and lost \u00a3127 for the season (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).", "|Henry Simons", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Henry Simons", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Henry Simons", "|Top scorer (league) ||19, Henry Simons", "|Top scorer (all competitions) ||19, Henry Simons", "| Henry Simons", "| Henry Simons"]}, {"page": "Tommy Simons (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Simons (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Henry Thomas Simons", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Simons (footballer)"]}]}}
