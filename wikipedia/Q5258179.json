With the emergence of Dennis Baldry, Danny Livingstone and Mike Barnard's move from The Football League to playing for Hampshire on a full-time basis, Flood's career did not survive much longer, with one appearance in 1960 against Oxford University. After a serious knee injury, he was released by Hampshire prior to the 1961 season.
