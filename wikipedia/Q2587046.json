While there, he met James Backhouse, the Quaker, who heard him speak about the treatment of the Aboriginals in Western Australia.  Backhouse was very impressed with Lyon, who elaborated his ideas in two papers on the subject that Backhouse received from him.  These were rediscovered over a century later and eventually published in London in 1941 by the Aboriginal Protection Board."]}, {"page": "Drosera peltata", "response": ["Drosera\u00a0peltata was first described by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1797. Due to its large range and varied habit, D.\u00a0peltata has accumulated a number of synonyms and infraspecific taxa, including varieties and subspecies. Most subspecies have been reduced to synonymy, but the two taxa that are still considered valid are D.\u00a0peltata\u00a0subsp.\u00a0peltata, which is an autonym, and D.\u00a0peltata\u00a0subsp.\u00a0auriculata, which was originally named by James Backhouse and formally described by Jules \u00c9mile Planchon in 1848 as D.\u00a0auriculata and later reduced to a subspecies of D.\u00a0peltata by Barry John Conn in 1981.Schlauer, J. 2009. World Carnivorous Plant List - Nomenclatural Synopsis of Carnivorous Phanerogamous Plants. Accessed online: 29 August 2009. Subspecies auriculata is still considered a valid and separate species by some authorities. The major difference between the subspecies involve seed shape and sepal pubescence. D.\u00a0peltata\u00a0subsp.\u00a0peltata has ovate (egg-shaped) seeds and the sepals are hairy or pubescent, whereas D.\u00a0peltata\u00a0subsp.\u00a0auriculata has linear seeds and glabrous sepals.Rice, Barry. 2009.

The origin of the name apparently arose from eagles being observed around the farm. By 1834, women prisoners were working as field labour at Eagle Farm. By 1836, forty female prisoners were housed there, washing and mending clothes, growing vegetables. The site remained a prison for twice convicted female felons until transportation ended in 1839.

This assertion also affected Threlkeld's conflict with the colonial magistrate, Rev. Samuel Marsden, and Presbyterian minister, Rev. John Dunmore Lang.C. Wilkes, p. 252; J. Harris, pp. 55 ff.; K. Clouten, p. 26; P. van Toorn, pp. 40\u201341. The LMS consequently appointed Marsden as a financial overseer and thus manager of the Bahtahbah mission.K. Clouten, p. 26. In 1828 the LMS, dissatisfied with Threkeld's evangelical work, directed him to abandon the Bahtahbah mission, and offered to pay for his return to London.C. Wilkes, p. 251; J. Harris, p. 56; K. Clouten, pp. 26\u201329; J. Turner and G. Blyton, p. 32. Declining the LMS invitation, Threlkeld was subsequently appointed by Governor Darling, on behalf of the colonial government, to continue his \"Christianisation and civilisation\" work with a salary of \u00a3150 a year and four convict servants, with rations.A. Keary, p. 126; J. Harris, p. 56; C. Wilkes, p. 251; K. Clouten, p. 28. This mission was allocated between 1000 and 1280 acres (405\u2013518 ha) on the northern side of Lake Macquarie, and were named as Derabambah, Punte and Puneir by Aboriginal populations and Ebenezer (mission) by the European population. Initially, a mission house with 12 rooms was built of weatherboard and plaster.K. Clouten, pp. 28\u201329; Lake Macquarie and District Historical Society, Toronto Lake Macquarie, N.S.W: The Pictorial Story, Westlake Printers, Boolaroo, 1979, p. 7.

However, with less financial support and goods to distribute Threlkeld's ability to persuade Awabakal people to remain on site dramatically decreased.A. Keary, p. 126. The official closure of the Ebenezer Mission occurred on 31 December 1841, with the precarious financial position of Threlkeld leading to the establishment of grazing stock and mining of coal seams on the property.N. Gunson, Threlkeld, Lancelot Edward (1788\u20131859) Retrieved 8 September 2017. In 1842 the British Secretary of State for the Colonies qualified the evangelical missions, such as Threlkeld's, as failures.J. Harris, p. 23.
