The following year, he organised the Easter Conference, held that year in Birmingham. By then, Mosley, although successful in cultivating Labour support in Birmingham and district, had used his own resources to finance the winning of six of the twelve available seats for Labour at the 1929 general election and was becoming increasingly pessimistic about the probability of achieving his goals of economic and social reform, even with a non-cabinet ministerial post, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Therefore, he set about drawing up his own proposals, which were referred to as the Mosley Memorandum. After being ignored for over two months, it was finally rejected in May 1930, which convinced Mosley that resignation and criticism of the government from the backbenches was the way forward. By the autumn of that year, there was a \"Mosley Group\" in Parliament, including Risdon's erstwhile colleague, Aneurin Bevan. Mosley reconstituted the memorandum into a Manifesto, which was published on 13 December 1930. His thinking that the state should play a strong role in the affairs of the country and that it \"should constitute a public utility organisation to turn out houses and building materials as we turned out munitions during the war\" was made clear in his \"immediate plan to meet an emergency situation\".Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 However, by then, Mosley had already started making plans for a new political party, including an office at One Great George Street, Westminster, in January 1931, and the same month, the proposals contained in the Memorandum and the Manifesto were published as a 61-page pamphlet, A National Policy, with the authors given as Aneurin Bevan, W. J. Brown, John Strachey and Allan Young.", "The New Party was founded on 1 March 1931.

Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 Risdon was undoubtedly one the New Party's founder members. His first major responsibility for the fledgling party was as election agent for Allan Young at the April 1931 by-election at Ashton-under-Lyne, a Labour seat, near Manchester. Young barely saved his deposit by earning third place with 16% of the votes cast. The Labour supporters were angry at their candidate being beaten into second place and formed a raucous mob outside the polling station, but Mosley faced them down and commented to Risdon, \"We saw worse than this in the war, Bill\".Cross, Colin. The Fascists in Britain. London: Barrie & Rockliff 1961 Not long afterward, Risdon was sent to Newcastle to develop a regional organisation in the North-East of England, and by the beginning of October, he had created branches in Hull, Newcastle and Gateshead.Worley, Matthew. Oswald Mosley and the New Party, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010,  Mosley meanwhile initiated a plan for an \"active force\" of stewards (forerunners of the later controversial \"Blackshirts\"), who were supplied in part by a nationwide network of athletic clubs that was aimed at British youth.Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 That was deemed necessary to prevent the violence and the intimidation that was a feature of most of the New Party's meetings, but that behaviour was not experienced only by the upstart party."]}]}}
