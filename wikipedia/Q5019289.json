At a time when the relation between science and religion was controversial, the encyclopaedia supported evolution, but it did not admit any contradiction between religious teachings and Darwin's views.Cf.

C. Forrester. The suit was in response to two articles by Saleeby in May 1912, prompted by a graphic vivisection display ADAVS had run in its Piccadilly shop, which Helen Rappaport writes attracted crowds of horrified onlookers. Saleeby accused Lind af Hageby in the Gazette of \"a systematic campaign of falsehood.\" Lind Af Hageby represented herself; this was at a time when women could not be admitted as lawyers in the UK, because they were not regarded as \"persons\" within the terms of the 1843 Solicitors Act."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Caleb Saleeby (1878\u20131940), public health advocate"]}, {"page": "Caleb Williams Saleeby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Caleb Saleeby"]}, {"page": "Caleb (given name)", "response": ["*Caleb Saleeby (1878-1940), English physician, writer, and journalist"]}, {"page": "Men's Dress Reform Party", "response": ["Unlike other organizations of the time, the MDRP had no formal journal. Instead, the group published articles about their reform ideas in Sunlight, a quarterly journal produced by The Sunlight League. MDRP member Dr. Caleb Saleeby chaired the Sunlight League, and thus incurred the league's support of the Men's Dress Reform Party. A Design Committee was organized to construct designs of \"acceptable\" clothing, and received national attention for their recommendations. Members claimed that branches were forming in all corners of the world, including India, China, Australia, South Africa, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, and Europe in addition to the approximately 200 branches in the UK. These groups held social events, rallies, and debates, but the prevalence of such events decreased with the onset of World War II. In 1937, the Men's Dress Reform Party lost the support of the New Health Society due to financial trouble and eventual bankruptcy. Then, in 1940, the Sunlight League also dissipated after a bomb destroyed their offices and the death of its founder, Dr. Saleeby. After this period, the Men's Dress Reform Party largely ceased to exist."]}, {"page": "Eugenic feminism", "response": ["Eugenic feminism was a component of the women's suffrage movement which overlapped with eugenics. Originally coined by the eugenicist Caleb Saleeby, the term has since been applied to summarize views held by some prominent feminists of the United States. Some early suffragettes in Canada, particularly a group known as The Famous Five, also pushed for eugenic policies, chiefly in Alberta and British Columbia.", "When Francis Galton originally formulated eugenics, he saw women functioning as a mere conduit to pass desirable traits from father to son. Later eugenicists saw women in a more active role, placing an increasing emphasis on women as \u201cmothers of the race\u201d.  In particular new research in the science of heredity and the studies of procreation, child rearing and human reproduction led to changes in eugenic thought, which began to recognize the importance of women in those parts of the human life cycle. This change in emphasis led eventually to eugenicist Caleb Saleeby coining the term eugenic feminism in his book Woman and Womanhood: A Search for Principles (1911).. Saleeby wrote,", "British eugenicists such as Caleb Saleeby, Karl Pearson, and Havelock Ellis, held that women were essentially reproductive agents.[...] Proponents of mainstream eugenics and some early advocates of women\u2019s rights found common ground. Not all early feminists supported eugenic practices, but the notion of social advancement as intricately tied to reproduction was central to both eugenicists and early feminists.[...] Some suffragists advocated for staunch immigration policies and eugenic practices such as mental hygiene and the social segregation and sexual sterilization of the \u201cfeeble-minded.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Saleeby", "response": ["*Caleb Saleeby (1878\u20131940), English physician, writer, and journalist"]}]}}
