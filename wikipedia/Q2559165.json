While the programme drew from the talent of British comedians, it also expanded to recruiting those from the United States; comedians such as Greg Proops and Mike McShane added considerably to performances, with some episodes in the third and fourth series filmed entirely within New York and thus drawing talent purely from American performers. By the fifth series, several regular performers discontinued their involvement, yet the show was greatly enhanced by the involvement of fresh talent by this time - British comedian Tony Slattery, American comedian Ryan Stiles, and Canadian comedian Colin Mochrie, improved the reputation of the programme and provided more diverse comedy and favorable viewing figures, effectively becoming prominent regulars in episodes.", "On 6 March 2011, over twelve years after the series finale, a special edition of the show was recorded for \"24 Hour Panel People\", a marathon of UK panel shows, in aid of Comic Relief.
