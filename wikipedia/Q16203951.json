Betts, the leading instrument dealer of his time in London, was one of the first to import Italian instruments. He is buried at Cripplegate Church.Betts apprenticed under Richard Duke starting in 1765, and eventually bought Duke's business from Duke's daughter. He started working independently by 1781, when he hired his first apprentice. Notable British craftsmen who worked for him include Bernard Simon Fendt, John Furber, Henry Lockey Hill, Joseph Hill II, Vincenzo Panormo, and Richard Tobin. Betts taught his craft to his younger brother Arthur, who inherited the business upon Betts' death in 1823. Under Arthur, the direction of the shop moved more towards the  reproduction of historic instruments. After Arthur's sons Arthur II and John II inherited the family business the shop eventually closed in 1867.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fionnuala Sherry", "response": ["Her instrument of choice, for both live and studio work, is an English John Edward Betts violin from 1790, with a Hill bow."]}, {"page": "John Betts", "response": ["* John Edward Betts (1755\u20131832), English luthier"]}]}}
