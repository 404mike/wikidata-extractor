Over the first two weeks of the regular season the Wizards would lose the services of seven total players from their normal 18 including the two previously mentioned and; Davy Arnaud, Josh Wolff, Kevin Souter, Eric Kronberg, and Herculez Gomez. These injuries would provide many opportunities for backups. Lance Watson took advantage and found himself playing right back in week 2 @ Colorado and impressed head coach Curt Anolfo enough to secure the spot. Rookie Graham Zusi filled the void out wide in right of midfield and was exposed in the opening loss to Toronto to then rebound in the second match before being sidelined with his own injury, a hamstring strain that would keep him out for all of April. After the disappointing opener the Wizards traveled to Colorado two days behind a blizzard that brought 14\u00a0inches of snow to Denver. The two clubs played in cold temperatures in front of a small crowd (at the same time as the USMNT) before the final whistle signaled a 2-1 victory to the Rapids. The Wizards fielded 4 starters in Colorado who had not even seen the field the week before. The lone goal by the Wizards came from seldom used back-up striker Michael Kraus, his first goal in MLS play.", "May began with disappointment as the club once again fell behind an opponent in the first half to only share the points with a second half equalizer. This first occurrence was when resurgent D.C. United visited for a rare Wednesday night match, despite creating many early chances the Wizards faltered and found themselves behind only to see Josh Wolff rescue a point on a play in which he appeared to be offside. The following Saturday the Wizards would aid Columbus in winning their first match and celebrating the Party like it's 1999 promotion that highlighted the tenth season of Columbus Crew Stadium. Wolff would score his fourth goal of the season but it proved too little too late despite the excellent service from Jack Jewsbury. Goalkeeper Kevin El Gato Hartman tallied 7 more saves as the Wizards surprised host Salt Lake handing them their first ever regular season loss in Rio Tinto Stadium. Inspired striker Josh Wolff remained on fire as he netted his fifth and sixth goals of the season pushing the club to their first win in May and second road shutout victory of the season. (Reserves News) The Swope Park Rangers welcomed back Doug DeMartin beating the Kansas City Brass 7-0, this marked a resurgence as goals came from the likes of struggling first teamers Herculez Gomez (2), Michael Kraus (2), and Graham Zusi returning from injury. There had been some hope that Adam Cristman could see the field but instead Kevin Souter and Abe Thompson appeared up top. The club's final home match of May brought in the league leaders Chivas USA on what also happened to be Dog's Night Out at the stadium. The Wizards, to form, didn't get it going until the second half and took the lead on Claudio L\u00f3pez's Goal of the Week free kick that beat Zach Thornton. Despite great shot stopping from Kevin Hartman the Wizards gave up the equalizer just minutes later and were forced to defend when Wolff was ejected for an attempted head-butt in the 68th minute, Santiago Hirsig also found himself hitting the showers early as the team played with 9 men for the final 7 minutes. The draw marked the first time in six appearances that Chivas has gotten a single point from their travels to Kansas City. Gregg Berhalter received a sending off after denying Claudio L\u00f3pez an obvious goal scoring opportunity in the 59th minute when he held Lopez's jersey for dear life, despite the man advantage it took a rather adventitious miss struck header that was redirected by Arnaud to put the club ahead. Arnaud's 84th-minute goal was the club's 7th scored following the 75th minute of matches and the 13th scored in the second half. Both were league records until Jack Jewsbury gave possession away and Edson Buddle brought The Galaxy even three minutes later for the shared points.", "|align=\"left\"|26||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kevin Souter"]}, {"page": "All-time Sporting Kansas City roster", "response": ["*  Kevin Souter"]}, {"page": "2009 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Matt Marquess||Kevin Souter||"]}, {"page": "Graceland Yellowjackets", "response": ["* Kevin Souter \u2013 Kansas City Wizards in Major League Soccer"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Canadian Soccer League players", "response": ["* Kevin Souter \u2013 Serbian White Eagles \u2013 2011"]}]}}
