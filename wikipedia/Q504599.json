It follows, and includes, Apache Indian's 1990\u201391 singles \u2013 \"Move Over India\", \"Chok There\" and \"Don Raja\" \u2013 which saw him pioneer a fusion of Jamaican ragga and Indian bhangra later known as bhangramuffin.", "The album showcases Apache Indian's fusion of ragga and dancehall beats and basslines with bhangra and other forms of Indian music, such as filmi, with songs delivered in a fusion of English, Punjabi and Jamaican patois that the musician called \"Indian patois\". He sought to write about topics that were traditionally undiscussed in Asian communities, such as alcoholism, AIDS, the caste system and arranged marriages, and the controversial nature of the lyrics drew criticism and protest from castes. The singer named the record with reference to Indian reservations and is depicted on the artwork before a mixture of Jamaican and Indian iconography, reflecting his mix of musical styles.", "On release, No Reservations drew acclaim from music critics, who saw its fusion of ragga and bhangra modes as innovative, and it reached number 36 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Arranged Marriage\", issued as the album's official lead single, was the musician's breakthrough success in his home country, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. Apache Indian was particularly successful in India, where the album sold over 500,000 copies and is certified triple platinum. No Reservations has been credited for helping popularise ragga music and British-Asian pop, and was nominated for the 1993 Mercury Prize, while Apache Indian received four nominations at the 1994 Brit Awards.", "Born Steven Kapur to an Indian migrant family, Apache Indian was raised in Handsworth, a multiracial neighbourhood in Birmingham home to reggae bands Steel Pulse and UB40. He grew up enjoying roots reggae artists like Bob Marley and Burning Spear, and interest in reggae grew larger when introduced to sound system culture by a British-Caribbean man, Sheldon, who ran the local Siffa sound system. Kapur began chatting with numerous systems, and grew out dreadlocks in his teens. He later said he was the only Indian he knew who enjoyed reggae, saying \"There was just something about the music. Regardless of what anybody said, it was for me.\" However, as Kapur would later explain, it was common for Asians in Birmingham to \"[pick up] things from the black kids 'cus they're living together. So you hear reggae in schools and in the streets, but you also hear traditional Indian music as well.\" Kapur took part of his stage name from Super Cat or the \"Wild Apache\", a Jamaican reggae musician who is also of Indian descent, and who was Kapur's musical idol.", "\"Move Over India\" and Apache Indian's subsequent singles saw him fuse Indian bhangra and Jamaican reggae, earning him the media title The Originator of Bhangra-Muffin, a combination of the words bhangra and raggamuffin, although the singer did not care for the term. Bhangra had become popular in the UK in the mid-1980s and was, according to Timothy D. Taylor, the first music to \"develop a strong Anglo-Asian identity\", particularly, argued Brooke Wentz of Vibe, when young practitioners began introducing influences of hip hop to make bhangra more dancebale than the original, folk-based form, with Apache Indian proving innovative for introducing reggae to the genre. Apache Indian explained he initially received criticism from the Indian community, who saw him, as he described it, as a \"traitor to the community\" for working in reggae, a genre that saw as \"violent and drug-related\", but that attitudes change when he expressed his Indian pride. Similarly, he said \"the black community felt I was using reggae to make a lot of money\" but changed their minds upon discovering his genuine love of the genre.", "The translation themes of \"Move Over India\" carried over into its proposed follow-up, \"Come Follow Me\", which featured Birmingham MC Mickey G, but the single was cancelled after the song had been heavily bootlegged. Instead, Apache Indian's next two singles, both for Sure Delight, were \"Chok There\" and \"Don Raja\". Aided mostly by pirate radio airplay, both singles continued Kapur's success in topping the UK's bhangra and reggae charts. In 1991, The British Reggae Industry Awards awarded Kapur with the award for Best Male Newcomer. Although none of his singles had reached the national pop charts, they attracted the attention of Island Records, who signed him in early 1992. Marc Marot of Island said they judged Apache Indian \"just from those singles [...] We felt that he had commercial possibilities regardless of where he came from and what background he had.\" After signing to Island, he made a national television appearance in the UK on Blue Peter.", "According to Apache Indian's manager, Mambo Sharma, \"so much thought\" went into recording No Reservations because, as the singer's debut album, it had to introduce listeners to his work effectively. Apache Indian travelled to Bob Marley's Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, to record part of No Reservations. He collaborated with numerous reggae stalwarts, including Sly Dunbar, Robert Livingstone and Bobby Digital, who all provided riddims for the album, as well as vocalists Frankie Paul and Maxi Priest. Most of the album, however, was produced by Simon & Diamond, with production credits for Phill Chill on \"Fix Up\", Bobby Digital on \"Guru\" and Dunbar on \"Magic Carpet\", with Livingstone providing mixing and additional production on \"Fix Up\". Apache Indian and Trevor Wyatt acted as executive producers, while Phill Chill mixed \"Arranged Marriage\".", "According to writer Les Back, Apache Indian's decision to record in Jamaica with local reggae luminaries was partly an attempt to legitimise his fusion of reggae with bhangra, while journalist Dave Cavanagh said the \"slew of the island's big names\" helped endorse the album's ragga elements. Although Kapur enjoyed working with reggae musicians, he made a conscious decision to \"separate from the Jamaican music scene,\" according to Wentz, with Kapur explaining that he made an effort \"to lean more towards my people.\" Part of the album was also recorded in New York City. No Reservations incorporates electronic production and digital sampling, which combined with Kapur's toasting and affinity for sound systems, situates the music in what writer Carla J Maier calls \"the clubs and the recording studios in which he works, while at the same time being part of a globalized and digitalized music culture.\" Kapur's earlier singles, including \"Move Over India\" and \"Chok There\", reappear on the album.", "On No Reservations, Apache Indian uses beats and basslines familiar to reggae and dancehall, incorporates styles and samples of bhangra, Hindi filmi music and Indian classical music to represent his Indian identity, and sings in a ragga style, resulting in what writer John Connell describes as \"a contemporary Anglo-Indian fusion\". Although described as primarily a bhangra album, critic Ken Hunt argues that the album is not bhangra itself but rather a \"bhangra-related dance music.\" J. Poet of Trouser Press similarly felt the record to primarily showcase Kapur as a raggamuffin deejay, while Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian observed that Kapur uses Indian instruments and subject matter to flavour a \"macho\" ragga style derived from Super Cat. Apache Indian considered his style to be \"first, and foremost, street music\", explaining: \"My stuff is all about the fusion of cultures and styles. I grew up with black and white people, my music is part of the people around me\". The sounds of sitar and \"hard-edged\" tabla permeate the record. David Vlado Moskowitz considers No Reservations to be more mainstream than Kapur's earlier releases, while Eamon Carr of the Evening Herald, who considers the album to fuse \"club styles, cultures and funky beats\", emphasises the \"ear for a commercial hook\".  ", "The album's lyrics, written by Apache Indian, feature social commentary and themes of social realism. Colin Larkin wrote that the record moved Kapur \"away from the frothier elements of his distinctive ragga-reggae and towards the role of social commentator and Anglo-Asian representative.\" The songs are \"relevant to Indian youth identity in Britain,\" according to Connell, while writer Steve Tilley says they deal with concerns typical to Asian youth,<Ref name=\"Tilley\" /> and they discuss racism, AIDS, arranged marriages, divorce, alcoholism, drugs, the caste system and bridging black-Asian hostilities, often taking a cautionary stance. References to the Taj Mahal, Amritsar, Gandhi and Ravi Shankar also feature.", "Kapur sings on the album in a mix of English, Jamaican and Punjabi patois, with songs generally being \"dancehall Jamaican English in style,\" cramming words and slangs from other communities. He uses words from the three patios interchangeably, often in reference to the \"sonic geography of his influences\", as on \"Chok There\", in which he references Karachi, New York, Kingston and London. According to Raoul Granqvist, Apache Indian's style takes everyday words from Punjabi and dancehall cultures and uses them \"interchangeably and in elaborate combinations,\" resulting in what Kapur calls \"Indian patios\", described by Granqvist as an \"urban lingua franca which provides a suture between communities while acknowledging specificities of their African and south Asian roots.\"", "Described by author Rainer Emig as a punning statement on \"segregation and integration\", the title No Reservation references Indian reservations. This allusion to Native American culture is consistent with Kapur's stage name and the lyrics of songs \"Fe Real\" and \"Badd Indian\", as well as later album titles Make Way for the Indian (1995) and Wild East (1997). Natalie Sarrazin interprets the names Apache Indian and No Reservation as \"signifying not only political resistance, but making light of the idea that all people of colour are lumped together in one category\". George Lipsitz observed that due to Kapur's stage name and the album title, several listeners speculated that the singer was a Native American himself. Apache Indian recalled that his confluence of British, American and Native American cultures became \"a problem\" when No Reservations was released, as Native Americans \"were fighting for no reservations at the time. But it was good in a kind of way because it helped the album. They idefntified with it in a way.\"", "Immi Dread Cally designed the album artwork using photography of Kapur by Kate Garner. The album cover reflects Apache Indian's mix of musical styles, depicting him depressed in clothes that combine elements from Rastafarian and American hip-hop fashions with British-Asian street style. The singer's haircut, credited to Jon the Man of Curtis, represents, as Maier describes it, \"a trend in the early 1990s among South Asians to wear artfully shaved hairstyles.\" Behind the singer is a paper-cut backdrop showing the Indian and Rastafarian flags, although the latter is distorted and only truly represented by its usage of red, gold and green. The back cover features a collage depicting Indian rupees and Jamaican dollars, and maps of Jamaica and Punjab, India.", "After Apache Indian's signing to Island, the label planned a promotional push for the singer. In 1992, \"Fe Real\" appeared on Maxi Priest's album of the same name, and was released by Virgin Records as a double A-side with his song \"Just Wanna Know\". It was Apache Indian's first hit single, reaching number 33 on the UK Singles Chart in November 1992. To promote the song together, Kapur and Priest undertook a short tour singing live vocals over backing tracks; the first performance was in Peterborough, known for its small Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities.", "His first single for Island, \"Arranged Marriage\" was released in January 1993. Thousands of bootleg cassette copies of the single were seized by Island in their struggle to persuade the British Asian community, who favoured cassettes, to change formats; the label nonetheless released a official cassette edition containing extended remixes. The song was playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and numerous regional radio stations, and the radio support proved crucial to Apache Indian's breakthrough in the UK. It entered the UK charts at number 27, between Little Angels and Paul McCartney, and Steven Wells of NME noted that \"In such company, Apache's ecstatic mix of bhangra, ragga and North African music burns itself into the average pop fan's brain like acid.\" The song ultimately peaked at number 16, where it stayed for two weeks, and the singer performed it on Top of the Pops with tabla player Pandit Dinesh. According to Sullivan, Kapur became \"the first Asian on Top of the Pops in years\". The song's impact on the Indian community in the UK was compared to the impact of Khaled's rai song \"Didi\" (1992) on France's North African community.", "Although it was speculated that Island would re-establish Bob Marley's Tuff Gong label, with Kapur as its first signing, No Reservations instead saw release on Mango Records, an Island subsidiary that was known for its worldbeat releases. However, the album proved to be one of several releases, alongside Chaka Demus & Pliers' Tease Me (1993) and singles by Angelique Kidjo, that saw the label build a reputation \"as an essential source for left-of-centre dance music,\" according to Larry Flick. The album was released in January 1993, and reached number 36 on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the chart for two weeks and becoming Kapur's only charting album. \"Chok There\" was re-released as the record's second official single, having already become a UK club hit. It reached number 30 in the UK in March, and was Kapur's biggest hit in Jamaica, where his music was popular on sound systems. Apache Indian's success coincided with the rise of ragga in the British mainstream, and he is credited alongside artists like Shinehead, Shaggy, Snow, Shabba Ranks, Bitty McLean, Inner Circle and Chaka Demus & Pliers for launching this development.", "Apache Indian was particularly successful in India, and he capitalised on the release of No Reservations there, where it was issued by PolyGram India, with a major tour that ensured heavy media exposure and airplay, in the process became the label's first British-Asian success. He first played in the country in June 1993, at the Andheri Sports Complex in Bombay to a crowd of 17,000. Kapur reflected that upon his first visit to the country, he was \"treated like a superstar\", adding: \"I was asked to meet the Prime Minister, which I did. I met Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow... nobody meets her. By the time I left India, they were calling me the 'Gandhi of Pop'.\" Within three months, the album had been certified double platinum in India, and by November, it had had sold over 200,000 there. Apache Indian's celebrity was huge by this point; MTV Asia played his videos in rotation, his face adorned at least 23 billboards in Bombay, while his cultural reach spread to advertisements for butter with a slogan riffing on Kapur's stage name. As of November 1998, the album had sold over 500,000 copies in India, and it is certified triple platinum.", "No Reservations received acclaim from music critics. A reviewer for Music & Media called the album a \"veritable feast of talent\", praising its ragga beats and considering the heavy usage of sitar to make Apache Indian's roots \"ever-present, making for a delightful deviation from the usual reggae formula\". Penny Kiley of Liverpool Echo said that by \"rooting ragga in Asian lifestyle and sounds\", No Reservations pioneered an effective new style of music. David Belcher of The Herald similarly said the album's melding of \"Afro-Caribbean ragga groovery\" with \"lilting Anglo-Asian electro bhangra and rap pungency\", as well as Kapur's hybrid patois and use of irony, resulted in a \"brilliant new dancefloor mode\".", "With the success of No Reservation and its singles, Apache Indian was described as the first pop star to hail from the UK's Asian-Indian community, with Carr crediting him for \"pushing the boundaries further back\" following the crossover success of UK-based Indian pop band Monsoon a decade earlier. Wells argued that, as Monsoon \"were one hit-wonders\" and Betty Boo and Bomb the Bass \"escape the average Brit's definition of 'Asian',\" Apache Indian was truly \"Britain's first Asian pop star\", whereas Tilley described Apache Indian as \"quite possibly the first true international Asian pop star\". Jonathan Kramer observed that Apache Indian's appeal varied worldwide, saying that his strong sales in Toronto were due to young Indian Canadians viewing the use of bhangra as \"a respect for Indian traditions,\" whereas the singer had a rebel image in India, whilst in England, his music \"became an important icon of unity between Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Asians\".", "No Reservations was nominated for the 1993 Mercury Prize for best UK album of the year. According to Sharma, the nomination \"came totally out of the blue\". The album drew 2-1 with Stereo MCs' Connected as second favourite to win, behind eventual winners Suede. Apache Indian received four nominations at the 1994 Brit Awards: Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, Best British Dance Act and Best British Single for \"Boom Shack-A-Lak\", the latter found on his Nuff Vibes EP, the follow-up to No Reservations which reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. According to author Rehan Hyder, the album's commercial success and Mercury Prize nomination largely increased media interest in Asian musicians.", "Thom Duffy of Billboard credits No Reservations for helping bring ragga music into \"the international pop mainstream\". Maier said the album was innovative for making \"some unprecedented musical connections\", although felt its fusion of ragga and bhangra could not be expanded on. Moskowitz wrote that the record secured Apache Indian's standing and \"artfully illustrated his ability to make a mark in reggae music\", while Williams felt that other British-Asian youth discovered \"some pride of their own\" through Kapur's promotion of cultural pride on the album. As No Reservations was PolyGram India's first British-Asian success, it ensured \"great potential\" in India for future such crossovers; Nyay Bhushan of Billboard wrote that Kapur's success \"reinforced the importance of an artist's personal effort to promote a product\", a challenge the label would later face with Talvin Singh's OK (1998).
