Like a painter with his oil canvasses. I wanted to make a music that had expansive synthesizer textures and sequencer patterns, layered together with expressive melodic electric guitars. Working with depth, time and space. In those years in the early eighties the studio technology was new and revolutionary, and I wanted to explore all the new possibilities. To be able to control the infinite variations of electronic sound, using an endless palette for creative expression. Musically this technology opened up a new possible world for me, and I have continued to further develop and refine these musical ideas on later recordings. Also for the last decades, I have been able to bring this my musical concept to the stage, performing live. I have been doing several tours, as well as releasing a double CD set live album \"Silent Currents\" (Projekt, CD-2011). As well as two download live albums \"Silent Currents 3\" (2013), and \"Star\u2019s End 2015\" (Silent Currents 4). I have also done several live concerts with Ian Boddy and Steve Roach.
