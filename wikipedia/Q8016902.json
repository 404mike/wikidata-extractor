In 'A History of Dorset' () A. Lindsay Clegg, former Town Clerk of Bournemouth, claims that Pike lived at Moordown, now within modern Bournemouth, then part of the Liberty of Westover. Pike, or Pyk was a common name in Westover since the 14th century, according to the Christchurch Cartulary (). Pike is also said to have lived at West Moors in West Parley, where he worked as a carpenter. He was executed by being hung, drawn and quartered on 22 December 1591 for denying the Royal Supremacy.  He is thought to have been converted to Catholicism by Thomas Pilchard. Rachel Lloyd suggests that the Pikes were a Bristol family, and that William (who lived in the Village of Moors on the Hampshire border) was the brother of Martha Pike. Martha's husband Henry Falkner had converted priest John Chapman to Catholicism, in 1579. Henry mentioned his brother-in-law William Pike in his will.Dorset Elizabethans At Home and Abroad, by Rachel Lloyd, 1967, pub John Murray, Albemarle Street, London, p.114."]}, {"page": "Hew Pike", "response": ["The son of army officer Lieutenant General Sir William Pike, Pike was educated at Winchester College and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and commissioned into The Parachute Regiment as a second lieutenant on 21 December 1962.

During his period there, the unit underwent a major reorganisation becoming 6th Field Force, Pike was largely responsible for the writing of the initial concept study detailing the proposed new structure, and also for its implementation, something which required cooperation from other army units, and the Royal Air Force, as well as liaison with NATO headquarters. As a result, he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1978 New Year Honours, the recommendation for the award concluded: \"his careful planning [has] undoubtedly saved much time and money. He has surpassed all that would normally be expected for an officer of his rank and age.\" From 1978 he was a company commander in 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (3PARA)."]}, {"page": "William Gregory Huddleston Pike", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pike (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Bedford School", "response": ["*Lieutenant General Sir William Pike KCB CBE DSO (1905\u20131993), Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff, 1960\u20131963"]}, {"page": "Vice Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir William Pike 1960\u20131963 "]}, {"page": "General Pike", "response": ["*William Pike (British Army officer) (1905\u20131993), British Army lieutenant general"]}]}}
