On the one hand, the fictional Baron Munchausen can be easily distinguished from the historical figure Hieronymus von M\u00fcnchhausen; the character is so separate from his namesake that at least one critic, the writer W. L. George, concluded that the namesake's identity was irrelevant to the general reader, and Richard Asher named Munchausen syndrome using the anglicized spelling so that the disorder would reference the character rather than the real person. On the other hand, M\u00fcnchhausen remains strongly connected to the character he inspired, and is still nicknamed the L\u00fcgenbaron (\"Baron of Lies\") in German. As the Munchausen researcher Bernhard Wiebel has said, \"These two barons are the same and they are not the same.\"", "In 1951, the British physician Richard Asher published an article in The Lancet describing patients whose factitious disorders led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder \"Munchausen's syndrome\", commenting: \"Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him\". The disease is now usually referred to as Munchausen syndrome. The name has spawned two other coinages: Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and Munchausen by Internet, in which illness is feigned online."]}, {"page": "Hugh Dennis", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 || Urban Myths || Richard Asher || 1 episode"]}, {"page": "1951 in science", "response": ["* Richard Asher describes M\u00fcnchausen syndrome."]}, {"page": "Myxedema psychosis", "response": ["Myxedema psychosis is a relatively uncommon consequence of hypothyroidism, such as in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or in patients who have had the thyroid surgically removed and are not taking thyroxine.
