He was President of the London Mathematical Society in the years 1951-1953.\n\nTemple took his first degree as an evening student at Birkbeck College, London, between 1918 and 1922, and also worked there as a research assistant. In 1924 he moved to Imperial College as a demonstrator, where he worked under the direction of Sydney Chapman. After a period spent with Eddington at Cambridge, he returned to Imperial as reader in mathematics. He was appointed professor of mathematics at King's College London in 1932, where he returned after war service with the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. In 1953 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Oxford, a chair which he held until 1968, and in which he succeeded Chapman. He was also an honorary Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford.\nAfter the death of his wife in 1980, Temple, a devout Christian, took monastic vows in the Benedictine order and entered Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight, where he remained until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E. T. Whittaker", "response": ["Whittaker died at his home, 48 George Square, Edinburgh, on 24 March 1956. He was buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Edinburgh, with \"mathematical precision at a depth of 6 ft. 6 inches\", according to the cemetery register. His entry in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society was written by George Frederick James Temple in November 1956. He received published obituaries from Alexander Aitken, Herbert Dingle, Gerald James Whitrow, and William Hunter McCrea, among others. His house was owned by Edinburgh University and was demolished in the 1960s to expand the campus and now holds the William Robertson Building.", "George Frederick James Temple noted that Whittaker's home in Edinburgh was \"a great centre of social and intellectual activity where liberal hospitality was dispensed to students of all ages\", and went on to note that Whittaker had a happy home life and was well loved by his family. Whittaker kept a piano in his home which he did not know how to play, but enjoyed listening to friends play when they would come over. Whittaker was also known to take a personal interest in his students and would invite them to social gatherings at his house. He also continued to keep track of his Honours students over the years. His home was also the location of many unofficial interviews that would have a large impact on a student's future career. After his death, William Hunter McCrea described Whittaker as having a \"quick wit\" with an \"ever-present sense of humour\" and being \"the most unselfish of men with a delicate sense of what would give help or pleasure to others\". He notes that Whittaker had a \"vast number of friends\" and that he \"never missed an opportunity to do or say something on behalf of any one of them\".", "Whittaker was the original author of the classic textbook A Course of Modern Analysis, first published in 1902. There were three more editions of the book all in collaboration with George Neville Watson, resulting in the famous colloquial name Whittaker & Watson. The work is subtitled an introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions and is a classic textbook in mathematical analysis, remaining in print continuously since its release over a hundred years ago. It covered topics previously unavailable in English, such as complex analysis, mathematical analysis, and the Special functions used in mathematical physics. George Frederick James Temple noted that it was unmatched in these aspects \"for many years\". The book was an edited set of lecture notes from the Cambridge Tripos courses Whittaker taught and contained results from mathematicians such as Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass which were relatively unknown to English speaking countries. A. C. Aitken noted the books have been widely influential in the study of special functions and their associated differential equations as well as in the study of functions of complex variables."]}, {"page": "Mathematical Association", "response": ["*1956 George Frederick James Temple"]}, {"page": "George frederick james temple", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Frederick James Temple "]}, {"page": "George Temple", "response": ["#redirect George Frederick James Temple"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|George Frederick James Temple||18/03/1943||2 September 1901 \u2013 30 January 1992"]}, {"page": "Temple (name)", "response": ["*George Frederick James Temple (1901-1992), English mathematician"]}, {"page": "1955 New Year Honours", "response": ["*George Frederick James Temple, Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy, University of Oxford."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1943", "response": ["#George Frederick James Temple"]}, {"page": "List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers", "response": ["*George Frederick James Temple"]}]}}
