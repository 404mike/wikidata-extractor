She is the youngest daughter of the festival's founder and organiser Michael Eavis and his second wife Jean. She grew up on Worthy Farm, Somerset, the site of Glastonbury Festival. In 1985, at age five, she performed Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star on the Festival's Pyramid Stage immediately before The Style Council headlined. After graduating from Wells Cathedral School in 1997, she began a teaching degree at Goldsmiths University, London. When her mother became ill with cancer, Eavis deferred her course and returned home to care for her.\nFollowing her mother's death in 1999, Eavis began assisting her father in running the festival and soon became co-organiser of the event. She is now responsible for overseeing the line-up of the festival. In 2007, Eavis created The Park area with her partner, music manager Nick Dewey. Eavis married Dewey in August 2009; the couple have three children, sons born in 2011 and 2013 and a daughter born in 2016. The couple is responsible for booking all of Glastonbury's main stages, with Dewey now the festival's Head of Music Programming. Together, they booked the festival's first hip hop headliner in 2008, Jay-Z. Other headliners Eavis and Dewey have booked include The Rolling Stones, Adele, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9, Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton, Kanye West, Neil Young, Lionel Richie, Blur, Paul Simon, Arctic Monkeys, Electric Light Orchestra, Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran. Eavis has also booked African and Middle Eastern artists on the Pyramid Stage. including Amadou & Mariam, Rokia Traore, Bassekou Kouyate, Songhoy Blues, Baaba Maal and Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music.Eavis has organised several fundraising concerts for Oxfam, including a Make Trade Fair concert at London's Astoria in October 2002 with Coldplay, Noel Gallagher and Ms Dynamite and a show at the Hammersmith Apollo in September 2004 headlined by REM. Eavis also organised a concert opposing the Iraq war at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in 2003, featuring Coldplay, Paul Weller, Faithless and Ronan Keating. Eavis has advocated female equality in music and equal representation across stages at Glastonbury. She also supports the White Ribbon Alliance. In 2019, Eavis was behind Glastonbury's decision to ban the sale of single-use plastic bottles at that year's festival in a bid to cut waste.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Friends of the Earth", "response": ["Among those present at the launch of Friends of the Earth (EWNI)'s climate change campaign The Big Ask were Jude Law,Radiohead's Thom Yorke to guest-edit Observer Magazine published March 20, 2008.

For 2005, the enclosed area of the festival was over , had over 385 live performances, and was attended by around 150,000 people. The Sunday headliner was originally scheduled to be Kylie Minogue, who instead pulled out in May to receive treatment for breast cancer. Basement Jaxx were announced as a replacement on 6 June. Both Coldplay and Basement Jaxx performed a cover of Kylie's \"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\" during their concert. 2005 saw a big increase in the number of dance music attractions, with the multiple tents of the Dance Village replacing the solitary dance tent of previous years. This new area contained the East and West dance tents, the Dance Lounge, Roots Stage, and Pussy Parlour, as well as a relocated G Stage, formerly situated in the Glade. The introduction of the innovative silent disco by Emily Eavis allowed revellers to party into the early hours without disturbing the locals\u00a0\u2014 a requirement of the festival's licensing. Following the death of DJ John Peel in the autumn of 2004, the New Tent was renamed the John Peel Tent, in homage to his encouragement and love of new bands at Glastonbury. The opening day of the 2005 festival was delayed by heavy rain and thunderstorms: Several stages, including the Acoustic Tent (and one of the bars), were struck by lightning, and the valley was hit with flash floods that left some areas of the site under more than four feet of water. The severity of the weather flooded several campsites, the worst affected being the base of Pennard Hill, and seriously disrupted site services. However Mendip District Council's review of the festival called it one of the \"safest ever\" and gives the festival a glowing report in how it dealt with the floods.", "Glastonbury 2007 (20\u201324 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey was also featured. In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the capacity expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. This was the first year that \"The Park\" area opened. Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Spinal Tap, Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new \"Introducing\" stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since the construction of the security fence, and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at \u00a3145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes. As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new \u00a3750,000 flood defences. However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points, such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads on the periphery of the site led to delays for people leaving the site.", "The festival was not held in 2012, giving the site and organisers a \"fallow year\" which originally would have been in 2011, in keeping with the tradition of taking a break every fifth year. Michael Eavis cited the shortage and likely cost of portable toilets and policing, due to the needs of the 2012 Summer Olympics, as being amongst the reasons. The decision to move the fallow year to 2012 also proved to be a fortunate one, as Somerset experienced spells of persistent heavy rain in the period up to and including the week that the festival would normally have been held. Indeed, Emily Eavis suggested that the festival itself might have been called off, such was the severity of the weather. Registration for tickets to the 2013 festival began in June 2011 and ticket booking opened at 9am on Sunday 7 October 2012, with 135,000 selling out in a record time of one hour and forty minutes. To mark the 2012 Glastonbury weekend, Eavis was invited to guest edit the local paper, the Western Daily Press, on Saturday 23 June.", "In February 2018, festival organiser Emily Eavis confirmed in a BBC interview that a plastic bottle ban could be enforced at the 2019 event for environmental reasons. Water kiosks, where festival-goers could get any type of bottle refilled, had been introduced in 2014. In February 2019, organisers confirmed the bottle ban would begin at that year's festival, encompassing all bars, traders and backstage areas.", "Since 1981, the festival has been organised by local farmer and site owner Michael Eavis (through his company Glastonbury Festivals Ltd). Eavis ran the festival with his wife Jean until her death in 1999, and now co-organises the event with his daughter Emily Eavis. In 2002, Festival Republic (a company consisting of both Live Nation and MCD) took on the job of managing the logistics and security of the festival through a 40% stake in the festival management company. This relationship ended in 2012 and Glastonbury festival is now independent. Glastonbury Festivals Ltd donates most of their profits to charities, including donations to local charity and community groups and paying for the purchase and restoration of the Tithe Barn in Pilton."]}, {"page": "Beth Orton", "response": ["Orton played at the One Big No concert in March 2003 at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, organised by Emily Eavis, and has participated in concerts hosted by producer Hal Willner, including the 2006 concert film Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, and performing a duet with Nick Cave as part of Willner's Allen Ginsberg Tribute at the Ace Theater in Los Angeles, in spring of 2015."]}, {"page": "Noel Gallagher", "response": ["Gallagher reportedly criticised the organisers of the 2008 Glastonbury Festival for scheduling U.S. hip-hop artist Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally rock-focused festival: \"If it ain't broke don't fix it. If you start to break it then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curveball in on a Sunday night you go, 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong.\" Emily Eavis, the organiser of the festival, said she was honoured Jay-Z was headlining the event: \"He's absolutely the right act for our festival. There's no reason why we should not have the greatest living hip-hop artist on at Glastonbury.\" Eavis also reminded Gallagher that The Roots, Cypress Hill, and De La Soul had all previously performed at Glastonbury. Jay-Z said, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip-hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression.
