Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was issued in 1921. According to her biographer, Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the \"saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men\".Hodge (1984), p. 17. The following year one of her contemporary short stories, \"A Proposal to Cicely\", was published in Happy Magazine.Fahnestock-Thomas (2001), p. 3.", "Heyer specialised in two types of romantic male lead, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) \"rude, overbearing, and often a bounder\".Quoted in Jane Aiken Hodge, The Private World of Georgette Heyer (London 1984) p. 109 Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated and often a style-icon.Jane Aiken Hodge, The Private World of Georgette Heyer (London 1984) p. 59 Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle)G.

Georgette Heyer's The Talisman Ring (1936), set in 1793 England, is a Regency romance with elements of mystery that Jane Aiken Hodge called \"very nearly a detective story in period costume\".

Aiken Hodge also felt that while it contained \"some happy moments of unmistakable Heyer humour,\" it failed to contain enough to \"hold a young reader for long.\""]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2009", "response": ["*Jane Aiken Hodge, 91, American-born British writer, suicide by drug overdose."]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Jane Aiken Hodge (1917\u20132009), American-born writer, daughter of Conrad Aiken"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Jane Aiken Hodge (1917-2009), American-born writer"]}]}}
