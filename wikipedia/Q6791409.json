Scunthorpe started strongly. They took the lead on 28 minutes, doubling their advantage shortly before half time. Watford improved after the break, but were unable to prevent a 2\u20130 defeat. Watford's final match of October was a trip to Pride Park, to face Derby County. In front of 27,119 spectators, the home side took a two-goal lead in the first half. Matthew Whichelow's first senior goal reduced Watford's deficit, but goals from Tomasz Cywka and Shefki Kuqi consigned Watford to a 4\u20131 defeat, which took them out of the playoff places."]}, {"page": "Matty Whichelow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "Matt Whichelow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Watford F.C. season", "response": ["||  Matthew Whichelow", "||  Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Matthew Whichelow", "| Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["| Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Watford F.C. season", "response": ["|4 February 2013 || Matthew Whichelow || Free Agent  || Mutual Termination", "||  Matthew Whichelow"]}, {"page": "Whichelow, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Whichelow"]}]}}
