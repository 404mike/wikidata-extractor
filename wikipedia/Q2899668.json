He was briefly on the books of Manchester City before signing for Arsenal in May 1914. He quickly made his debut for the Gunners, in a Second Division against Huddersfield Town on 21 November 1914, a game that Arsenal lost 3\u20130. Blyth made 12 appearances in 1914\u201315 but by then the First World War had broken out, and Blyth duly joined the Royal Army Service Corps, serving in France.Upon the end of hostilities and the resumption of football in 1919, Blyth returned to Arsenal and immediately became a regular in the newly promoted side. An energetic \"midfield dynamo\", Blyth usually figured on the left of midfield, as a left half or inside left. He became a mainstay in the side, with over 300 league games in 10 seasons, and became club captain in 1925. He also played in the 1927 FA Cup Final, Arsenal's first cup final, which they lost 1\u20130 to Cardiff City. In total, he played 343 matches for Arsenal, scoring 51 goals.\nHe moved to Birmingham in May 1929, playing his last first-team game in September 1930 before retiring at the end of the 1930\u201331 season. Blyth also starred in one of the first football-related films, the 1930 production The Great Game. After retiring, Blyth moved back to Scotland, and ran a pub in Port Seton. He died in Worthing, West Sussex, England, in 1968 at the age of 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bob John", "response": ["John was displaced from the Arsenal side in 1923\u201324 thanks to competition from Billy Blyth and Andrew Young, but after being switched to left back to cover for Andy Kennedy, he was a near ever-present in 1924\u201325. Eventually however, John was switched back to left half, and this time he remained a first-team regular. A prodigious ball-winner and noted passer of the ball, John reached (but lost) the FA Cup Final with Arsenal in 1926\u201327, after a mistake by his compatriot and close friend Dan Lewis; it was John who consoled Lewis after the final whistle, assuring him he would get another chance to a win a medal (although Lewis never did).  He played in Arsenal's 2\u20131 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930."]}, {"page": "William Blythe", "response": ["* Billy Blyth (1895\u20131968), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the quarter final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Arsenal initially went down by a goal but an equaliser came from Billy Blyth after a further 15 minutes. Both teams had good attacks on goal throughout the rest of the game, but the only further goal came from a header by Hulme for Arsenal after a run and a cross from Jack Butler. The draw for the semi-final saw Arsenal play Southampton at Stamford Bridge. The muddy state of the pitch hampered the pace of the play shown by Arsenal, but both Buchan and Hulme scored for The Gunners to Southampton's single response by Bill Rawlings.
