As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman who bowled occasional slow left-arm orthodox spin, and a fearless fielder at short leg.Eagar was educated at Cheltenham College and played for Gloucestershire from 1935 to 1939, and for Oxford University in 1938 and 1939. During the Second World War no first-class cricket was played in England. It was therefore seven years before Eagar resumed his county career with Hampshire, for whom he played between 1946 and 1957, captaining the side for those twelve seasons.\nEagar retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 1958 season after playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club. He died in 1977 in Kingsbridge, Devon, at the age of 59. In August 1958 he did some cricket commentary for BBC Radio in the South and West of England only and in 1960 he commentated for Southern Television.The cricket photographer Patrick Eagar is his son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie", "response": ["Ingleby-Mackenzie played his first match for Hampshire in 1951, having been spotted at Eton by Desmond Eagar, although he was bowled for a duck by Alan Oakman in his debut innings.", "After sharing the county captaincy with Desmond Eagar in 1957, he became sole captain in 1958, in which year he was also named as the Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1958\u201359", "response": ["The tour manager was Freddie Brown, the rugged ex-Northamptonshire and England captain.

Brown had a more robust and combative style than May and wanted to complain officially about what the English party perceived as the throwing actions of the Australian bowlers, which might have resulted in a Bodyline type crisis. May refused, and Brown's unofficial complaints were rebuffed by Sir Donald Bradman. Fred Trueman thought \"he was a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot\"p219, Trueman Brown did not like Trueman either and threatened to send the Yorkshire fast bowler home, but May smoothed things over. The assistant-manager was Desmond Eagar, the captain of Hampshire in 1946\u201357, who built up the attacking team that would win the County Championship in 1961 and was a noted cricket historian. Like Brown, George Duckworth had toured with Jardine, and was now the scorer, baggage-master and general factotum. The physiotherapist or masseur was Desmond Montague, an experienced professional who would have a lot of work to do on the tour.p5, Bedser"]}, {"page": "Duke of Norfolk's XI", "response": ["The Duke of Norfolk's XI have made two first-class tours overseas.

Hampshire safely negotiated the last few overs on Thursday evening to close on 18 for 0 before totalling 224 for 7 declared on Friday, Jim Bailey again the top scorer with 63. This was a sporting declaration by the Hampshire captain Desmond Eagar as there was time to bowl only 47 overs before the close. Cyril Washbrook led the chase with 105 while Jim Bailey, having twice starred with the bat, took six for 82. When the last over began, Lancashire had reached 220 for 8 with Jack Ikin and wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow batting, but this was the last wicket as William Roberts had been taken to hospital with a broken finger and could not bat. Ikin and Barlow came together at 204 for 8 and so had added 16 for the final wicket to level the scores. Barlow was on strike and facing off spinner Gerry Hill.

The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper Neil McCorkell who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. Neville Rogers and Johnny Arnold played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and Gerry Hill both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder Jim Bailey, who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs.

The record attendance for a county match was made in 1948, when 10,000 watched Hampshire played Sussex. Hampshire continued to play four matches per season there going into the 1950s.  It was during this time that under the leadership of Desmond Eagar and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that the Hampshire team was beginning to become a powerful force in the county game.  Coupled with the batting of Roy Marshall (who in five matches there in 1957 scored 549, an unbeaten record for the ground), Jimmy Gray and Henry Horton, and backed up with the bowling of Derek Shackleton, Victor Cannings and Malcolm Heath, Hampshire had a fairly successful period, finishing runners-up in 1958, before winning the County Championship for the first time in 1961, with Hampshire winning four of their five matches there in that season.  They might have been successful in 1958, had it not been for two draws later in the season at the ground. A new format, List A cricket, was introduced in 1963, two years after its introduction, the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Kent in the 1965 Gillette Cup. Six first-class matches had been held there in 1962, before the schedule at the ground was reduced back to five, with the expansion of List A cricket with the Player's County League and John Player League, on average two or three List A matches were held there over the coming seasons. Hampshire were pressing for the Player's County League title in 1969, with a crowd of 8,000 watching their defeat to Essex. Hampshire finished that season's competition one point behind winners Lancashire.  A first-class match in 1971 between Hampshire and the touring Pakistanis saw protests by Bangladeshis protesting Pakistani actions in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time in 1973, though the 1970s saw a gradual reduction in the number of first-class matches held there, by the end of that decade three first-class matches and two List A matches were granted to the ground each season. This decade also saw logistical problems for the ground, when at the Railway End trees were destroyed, whose removal interrupted the batsman line of sight.  As such, no matches were held there in 1975, though the purchase of screens allowed county cricket to return in 1976.  1976 was also not without its problems, when a County Championship match against Yorkshire was interrupted by vandals who had attacked the pitch during the night.  Despite this setback, the match continued on an adjoining strip of pitch."]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  Desmond Eagar 1946-1957"]}, {"page": "Thomas Maxwell (cricketer)", "response": ["Having played infrequently in the Minor Counties Championship for the Surrey Second XI since 1927, Maxwell was selected to play for the combined Minor Counties cricket team in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders in 1937 at the Rose Brothers Ground, Gainsborough.

In response, the New Zealanders made 337 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by making just 76 all out, with Maxwell being dismissed for a duck by Norman Gallichan. Set 49 for victory, the New Zealanders reached their target with 7 wickets in hand, despite Maxwell taking the wicket of Gallichan.
