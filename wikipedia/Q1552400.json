They met a second time, during which Guerrero handed over four crudely copied photographs.Hounam, pp. 13-14 On 7 September 1986, two men who identified themselves as officers from Shin Bet approached Vanunu's older brother Albert in his carpentry shop in Beersheba and questioned him about his brother. They told him that he was in Australia, that he was talking to a British newspaper about his work at the nuclear research center, urged him to dissuade his brother, and then made him sign a non-disclosure agreement barring him from talking about the meeting.Hounam, p. 53 On 10 September, Vanunu and Hounam flew to London from Australia.
