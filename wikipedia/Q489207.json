On 9 January 1909, Shackleton and three companions\u2014Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams\u2014reached a new Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b0\u00a023'\u00a0S, a point only  from the Pole. En route the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier\u2014named after Shackleton's patron\u2014and became the first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: \"All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me\". They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.", "Study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, medical officer to the 190709 expedition, suggests that Shackleton suffered from an atrial septal defect (\"hole in the heart\"), a congenital heart defect, which may have been a cause of his health problems."]}, {"page": "Mount Erebus", "response": ["Mount Erebus' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of Sir Ernest Shackleton's party; Professor Edgeworth David, Sir Douglas Mawson, Dr Alister Mackay, Jameson Adams, Dr Eric Marshall and Phillip Brocklehurst (who did not reach the summit),  in 1908. Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer Roger Mear on 7 June 1985, a member of the \"In the Footsteps of Scott\" expedition.Mear, Roger and Robert Swan, In the Footsteps of Scott, pp. 95\u2013104.  On 19\u201320 January 1991, Charles J. Blackmer, an iron-worker for many years at McMurdo Station and the South Pole, accomplished a solo ascent in about 17 hours completely unsupported, by snow mobile and on foot."]}]}}
