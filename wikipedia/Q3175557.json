His stage name (always spelled with a capital \"M\" and a capital \"K\") is a homage to 1960s British pop producer Joe Meek.\nA multi-instrumentalist, MeeK plays all the instruments on his recordings through a multitracked/multi-layered method of recording and provides all vocals including multi-layered backing harmonies.\nSince his first album in 2002 and an ever strong presence on the Internet right from its very early days as a mass media, MeeK is part of the European pop/rock Indie music scene. Over the years and through word-of-mouth some have come to consider him a \"cult-artist\" because of his ever dedicated worldwide fanbase, his rather non-typical and enigmatic persona and the fact that he is one of the first few artists in Europe who have pioneered in utilizing the Internet as a marketing tool and a medium to publicize and/or expose their music to the general public in the late-1990s, long before the advent of social networks like MySpace, Facebook or YouTube.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Six Feet Under", "response": ["* \"Six Feet Under\", a song by Franco-British singer MeeK from his 2007 album \"Sortie de Secours\""]}, {"page": "MeeK (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT MeeK"]}]}}
