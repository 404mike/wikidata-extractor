Under these rulings, the borough bailiffs (mayors after 1638) had power to appoint masters, along with Ashton's old college, St John's, having an academic veto. Since then, the appointment of Johnian academics to the Governing Body, and the historic awarding of 'closed' Shrewsbury Exhibitions, has continued. The most recent Master of St. John's, the late Chris Dobson, was an ex officio Governor of Shrewsbury from 2007.

Experimenters rapidly trigger the folding of a sample of unfolded protein and observe the resulting dynamics. Fast techniques in use include neutron scattering, ultrafast mixing of solutions, photochemical methods, and laser temperature jump spectroscopy. Among the many scientists who have contributed to the development of these techniques are Jeremy Cook, Heinrich Roder, Harry Gray, Martin Gruebele, Brian Dyer, William Eaton, Sheena Radford, Chris Dobson, Alan Fersht, Bengt N\u00f6lting and Lars Konermann."]}, {"page": "Linacre College, Oxford", "response": ["* Chris Dobson, chemist and structural biologist, and Master of St John's College, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["thumb|150px|Chris Dobson", "* Sir Chris Dobson (1949\u20132019), professor and academic, FRS"]}]}}
