The eggs are subspherical to spherical in shape. Some are isolated but some were also found in association with the shells of perisphinctid ammonites. They were interpreted by the researchers as ammonite eggs sacks and are the best preserved specimens of such known to science. The parents of the egg sacks are thought to be two local ammonite genera co-occurring with the eggs, Aulacostephanus and Pectinatites."]}, {"page": "Duke's Aldridge Academy", "response": ["* Jane Clarke, scientist"]}, {"page": "The Life Scientific", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Clarke, Jane\"| Jane Clarke"]}, {"page": "Centre for Protein Engineering", "response": ["* Jane Clarke"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2015", "response": ["# Professor Jane Clarke FMedSci "]}, {"page": "Jane Clarke", "response": ["Jane Clarke may refer to:", "* Jane Clarke (scientist) (born 1950), professor of molecular biophysics at the University of Cambridge", "* Jane Clarke (media industry)", "* Jane Clarke (poet), from Co.
