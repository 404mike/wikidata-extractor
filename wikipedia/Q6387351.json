In The Hand of Fear (1976), the Kastrian Eldrad compared his transformation, from female to male, to Time Lord regeneration, possibly suggesting the process could produce a sex change. The concept of Time Lords changing gender upon regeneration was seeded throughout Moffat's tenure as showrunner. In the second part of \"The End of Time\" (2010), the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) briefly checks for an Adam's apple upon regeneration to confirm if he is still a man. In the 2011 episode \"The Doctor's Wife\", the Doctor recalls a Time Lord acquaintance known as the Corsair, who had at least two female incarnations. In the 2013 short \"Night of the Doctor\", the Sisterhood of Karn offer a dying Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) control over his inevitable regeneration, with \"man or woman\" being touted as possibilities. The first on-screen cross-gender regeneration was shown in the 2015 episode \"Hell Bent\", in which a white male Gallifreyan general (Ken Bones) regenerates into a black woman (T'Nia Miller), who states that her previous incarnation was the only time she had been a man."]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac cast members", "response": ["*Ken Bones"]}, {"page": "The Con is On (Hustle)", "response": ["*DCI Mullens \u2013 Ken Bones"]}, {"page": "Seekers (TV series)", "response": ["*Ken Bones -  Tony Laytham "]}, {"page": "Her Naked Skin", "response": ["*Doctor Klein/ Augustine Birrel - Ken Bones"]}, {"page": "Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant", "response": ["*Ken Bones \u2013 Erasmus"]}, {"page": "List of television programs in which one character was played by multiple actors", "response": ["**Character: The General.
