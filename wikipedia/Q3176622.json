He managed to get away, but lost Noodle in the process. Russel was then captured by the North Korean government and declared a Pulgasari, becoming an attraction at a North Korean amusement park. North Korea's food rations eventually caused Russel to shrink back to his normal size and he's stayed mostly normal sized ever since. Following this, he was sent back to England, where he stayed at Gorillaz collaborator Jeff Wootton's house before they were both contacted by Murdoc and told the band were getting back together. After the Humanz campaign ended, Russel hosted a podcast for Deezer in 2018 called \"Gorillaz: Things I Like\", where he interviewed various Humanz collaborators."]}, {"page": "Dead Man's Shoes (2004 film)", "response": ["On 17 November 2012, as part of Warp Films 10-year anniversary celebrations (WarpFilms10), Dead Man's Shoes was re-scored live at the Magna Science and Adventure Centre in Rotherham by musicians Gavin Clark, Joel Cadbury, Jah Wobble and more.
