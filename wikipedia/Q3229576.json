During the Second World War he headed the codes office supporting resistance agents in occupied Europe for the secret Special Operations Executive organisation. After the war, Marks became a playwright and screenwriter, writing scripts that frequently utilised his war-time cryptographic experiences. He wrote the script for Peeping Tom, the controversial film directed by Michael Powell which had a disastrous effect on Powell's career, but was later described by Martin Scorsese as a masterpiece. In 1998, towards the end of his life, Marks published a personal history of his experiences during the war, Between Silk and Cyanide, which was critical of the leadership of SOE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cryptographers", "response": ["* Leo Marks UK, SOE cryptography director, author and playwright."]}, {"page": "January 15", "response": ["*2001 \u2013 Leo Marks, English cryptographer, playwright, and screenwriter (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "One-time pad", "response": ["A separate notion was the use of a one-time pad of letters to encode plaintext directly as in the example below.

Leo Marks reports that the British Special Operations Executive used one-time pads in World War II to encode traffic between its offices. One-time pads for use with its overseas agents were introduced late in the war. A few British one-time tape cipher machines include the Rockex and Noreen. The German Stasi Sprach Machine was also capable of using one time tape that East Germany, Russia, and even Cuba used to send encrypted messages to their agents."]}, {"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["As with their first radio sets, SOE's first ciphers were inherited from SIS. Leo Marks, SOE's chief cryptographer, was responsible for the development of better codes to replace the insecure poem codes. Eventually, SOE settled on single use ciphers, printed on silk. Unlike paper, which would be given away by rustling, silk would not be detected by a casual search if it was concealed in the lining of clothing.", "Section N of SOE ran operations in the Netherlands. They committed some of SOE's worst blunders in security, which allowed the Germans to capture many agents and much sabotage material, in what the Germans called the 'Englandspiel'. SOE ignored the absence of security checks in radio transmissions, and other warnings from their chief cryptographer, Leo Marks, that the Germans were running the supposed resistance networks. A total of 50 agents were caught by the Germans and brought to Camp Haaren in the South of the Netherlands. Five captured men managed to escape from the camp. Two of them, Pieter Dourlein and Ben Ubbink, escaped on 29 August 1943 and found their way to Switzerland. There, the Netherlands Embassy sent messages over their controlled sets to England that SOE Netherlands was compromised. SOE set up new elaborate networks, which continued to operate until the Netherlands were liberated at the end of the war. In September 1944, as allied military forces were advancing into the Netherlands, the remaining captured SOE agents were taken by the Germans from Camp Haaren to Mauthausen concentration camp and executed.", "* Colin Gubbins, Leo Marks and the SOE"]}, {"page": "Violette Szabo", "response": ["In 2012 Max Hastings wrote that Szabo was \"adored by the men and women of SOE both for her courage and endless infectious Cockney laughter\", while Leo Marks remembered her as \"A dark-haired slip of mischief....She had a Cockney accent which added to her impishness\".", "Due to the ankle injury, Szabo's first deployment was delayed, but it was during her second course at Ringway that she first met Philippe Liewer (d. c. 1948).

However, the mission was postponed when F Section received a signal from Harry Peulev\u00e9's (codename Jean) Author circuit warning that several members of the Rouen-Dieppe group had been arrested, including Claude Malraux (codename Cicero; brother of novelist Andre Malraux) and radio operator Isidore Newman. This extra time meant Szabo could be sent for a refresher course in wireless operation in London, and it was then that Leo Marks, SOE's cryptographer, seeing her struggle with her original French nursery rhyme, gave Szabo his own composition, The Life That I Have as her code poem.", "The Violette Szabo GC Museum is housed in the cottage in Wormelow Tump, Herefordshire, that Violette's English cousins formerly owned, and that Violette would visit before the war to enjoy walks in the surrounding hills.

Eventually, the SOE began using original compositions (thus not in any published collection of poems from any poet) to give added protection (see The Life That I Have, an example). Frequently, the poems were humorous or overtly sexual to make them memorable (\"Is de Gaulle's prick//Twelve inches thick//Can it rise//To the size//Of a proud flag-pole//And does the sun shine//From his arse-hole?\"). Another improvement was to use a new poem for each message, where the poem was written on fabric rather than memorized.", "* Between Silk and Cyanide by Leo Marks, HarperCollins (1998) ; Marks was the Head of Codes at SOE and this book is an account of his struggle to introduce better encryption for use by field agents; it contains more than 20 previously unpublished code poems by Marks, as well as descriptions of how they were used and by whom."]}, {"page": "F.

While that event inspired the use of two teen-aged Danes as his primary characters, the story of the photographing of the German radar station and flying the film to Britain was actually that of Thomas Christian Sneum, a Flight Lieutenant in the Danish Naval Air Service, who made the flight to Britain on 21 June 1941 in a Hornet with Keld Peterson, the mechanic who helped him rebuild it.

SOE's head of codes Leo Marks also claims to have realised that, unlike all other coded messages from agents in other countries, the Dutch messages contained no errors. He reasoned that this was because they were not coded in the field by harried and harassed wireless operators, but by expert German cryptographers. The Dutch messages were too good to be genuine.  In the documentary Churchill's Secret Army Marks recounts how a wireless operator ended a telegraphic radio communication with \"HH\", which stood for Heil Hitler and was the usual closing for German communications.  The other party instantly replied \"HH\" which indicated that the transmitter was a German who was used to adding \"HH\" to messages automatically and not a British agent who would have been confused by the two letters.  Finally, Marks sent a Dutch agent in the Netherlands a deliberately garbled message.  Marks reasoned that no ordinary SOE agent could decrypt the message, but that the German cryptographers could and would. The Dutch agent responded to the garbled message, which indicated to Marks that he was transmitting under the control of the Germans. Marks reported these findings to his superior who told him to not discuss the matter with anybody else; no action was taken.
