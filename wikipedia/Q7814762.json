Congregational membership increased from 487 to 611 in his first year.", "Tom Allan was a key planner, contributor and missioner to the 1950 and 1952 \u2018Radio Missions,' which Falconer thought unique to Scotland, being Christian mission promoted by radio programmes broadcast by a national network. Local churches were invited to set up listening groups and discuss, assess and act on the content of the broadcasts - Falconer also wrote that while only a small minority did more than simply listen in, North Kelvinside provided model cooperation.", "The Tell Scotland Movement emerged directly from the experience of the Radio Missions and more broadly because, post war, churches throughout Europe shared a consensus that mission must be the priority. Supported by Scotland's Protestant denominations, the Movement adopted three principles: that mission is not occasional but continuous; that the agent of mission is the Church itself and that the place of the Layman is decisive.James Whyte, 'Foreword' in Allan, Tom The Face of My Parish Glasgow: Loudoun Publications 1984, pp.5-6; Highet, John (1960) The Scottish Churches London: Skeffington & Son. pp.86-87. Tom Allan demitted from North Kelvinside and accepted appointment as Field Organiser for Tell Scotland: he travelled widely to communicate the vision and principles of the Movement, and helped develop a three-year plan of preparation, training and practice with the aim of achieving not simply parish missions but missionary parishes.", "The Billy Graham campaign in London in 1954 caused divisions in the Tell Scotland leadership: Rev. Dr George MacLeod and the Iona Community especially objecting to such crusade evangelism. Yet as a Billy Graham visit to Scotland seemed inevitable,  Tom Allan recommended that an \u2018All Scotland Crusade\u2019 could fit into the Tell Scotland programme by inspiring many more lay people to commit themselves to undertake local church evangelism; the Movement's leadership agreed with him and invited Graham to conduct the 'All Scotland Crusade' of March to April, 1955. Tom Allan was appointed Chairman of the Executive Committee for the Crusade while remaining Tell Scotland Field Organiser.Dr William Fitch, 'The story of beginnings and preparation' in Allan, Tom (ed.) (1955) Crusade in Scotland ... Billy Graham London: Pickering & Inglis pp.28-33.", "Later analysis of the Crusade was positive and negative.'To What End? An Appraisal of Effect' in  Undoubtedly many new Christians were won and many others inspired to enter more deeply into the work of their local churches, but the Crusade had not penetrated much beyond the existing church allegiance. Many opted for the way of mass evangelism rather than the way of local witness and service, two 'ways' that Tom Allan himself considered had to go hand in hand: \"Tom was as left wing as George\", George MacLeod's biographer, Ron Ferguson, considered.", "Following the Crusade, Tom Allan resigned as Organiser for Tell Scotland and in September 1955 became minister of the city-centre of Glasgow at St George's-Tron Church.", "Of course, normal church structures could never be adapted to impinge much on the variety of deep-seated social problems. Tom Allan got in touch with the Social Responsibility Department of the Church of Scotland (now called 'Crossreach'). A partnership was formed with the vision of setting up a counselling and rehabilitation facility in the city. The Tom Allan Counselling Centre offered accessible short-term help with all types of problems; the Glasgow Lodging House Mission was a partner for help with homelessness. At the heart of all this were volunteers from the Church. Some were medical and social professionals others provided stand-alongside friendship. All were trained to be able to share their faith in a natural sensitive witness. The congregation began to reflect wider Glasgow society regardless of class or wealth.", "A very different kind of \u2018pulpit\u2019 opened up for Tom Allan when he was asked to write a weekly column for the Glasgow Evening Citizen.

He took on the challenge although he was himself a very heavy smoker from RAF days.

He had to give up everything. However, it was found that the heart damage was not serious and slowly over a year, he was able to pick up all the tasks as before, accepting invitations to USA and Canada.
