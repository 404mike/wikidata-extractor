The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and the period saw the establishment of roundarm bowling as an accepted practise.\nCounty cricket clubs began to become more formally established during this period and Sussex County Cricket Club, the oldest professional sporting organisation in the world, was formerly established in 1839. This would soon be followed by formal organisations in other counties, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1726 and 1840 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["Jones is a surname common in the English-speaking world.
