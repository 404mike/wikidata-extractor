The ship was slightly damaged on 7 January when the pre-dreadnought battleship  broke loose from her moorings and collided with Orions bow. The division was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships  and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. King-Hall was relieved by Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss on 29 October. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with Thunderer to evaluate the effectiveness of the latter's gunnery director. Thunderer decisively outshot Orion, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from Orions guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and Orion performed much better, apparently beating Thunderer.Brooks, pp. 164\u201365 The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, at Spithead on 24 June 1913 and then participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August. Wemyss was relieved in his turn by Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet on 28 October. Captain Frederic Dreyer assumed command of Orion that same day. On 4 November, Orion, Thunderer, the dreadnought  and the predreadnought  fired at and sank the target ship  to give their crews experience in firing live ammunition against a real ship.Brown, p. 29"]}, {"page": "St Giles' Cathedral", "response": ["The Elsie Inglis memorial in the north choir aisle was designed by Frank Mears and sculpted in rose-tinted French stone and slate by Pilkington Jackson (1922): it depicts the angels of Faith, Hope, and Love.Marshall 2011, p. 56.
