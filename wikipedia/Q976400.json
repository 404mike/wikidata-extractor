Laird's commercial expedition between 1832 and 1834 to navigate the Niger and initiate trade between Europeans and Africans northwards of the coast was considered a failure, majority of the passengers died and the volume of trade realized was minimal. However, his experience provided information about the design of vessels suitable on the Niger and the various settlements in the interior of the Niger Delta.\nLaird never returned to Africa but instead devoted himself to the development of trade with West Africa and especially to the opening up of the countries then forming the British protectorates of Nigeria. One of his principal reasons for so doing was his belief that this method was the best means of stopping the slave trade and raising the social condition of the Africans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Macgregor Laird (1808\u20131861), merchant and shipbuilder; pioneered British trade on the Niger River; his ship Sirius was the first to cross the Atlantic Ocean run entirely on steam power; supported the abolition of the slave trade"]}, {"page": "Liverpool", "response": ["In her poem \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress."]}, {"page": "Blue Riband", "response": ["The idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by Junius Smith, an American lawyer turned London merchant.  The idea came to him during an Atlantic crossing which took 57 days, a not unusual occurrence,. and it was published in the American Rail Road Journal. After receiving no support for several years, his plan gained credibility when Scottish shipbuilder, Macgregor Laird became an investor. Smith, who is often considered the Father of the Atlantic Liner, formed the British and American Steam Navigation Company to operate a London-New York service. About the same time, the question of Atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director's meeting of the newly formed Great Western Railway when the line's chief engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between Bristol and New York. The necessary investors were recruited by Brunel's friend, Thomas Guppy, a Bristol engineer and businessman. The next year, the Great Western Steamship Company was established, even though the rail line was still years from completion."]}, {"page": "Richard Lander", "response": ["In 1832, Lander returned to Africa for a third and final time, as leader of an expedition organised by Macgregor Laird and other Liverpudlian merchants, with the intention of founding a trading settlement at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers, using two armed paddle steamers, the Quorra and the Alburkah. However, the expedition encountered difficulties, many personnel died from fever, and it failed to reach Bussa. While journeying upstream in a canoe, Lander was attacked by natives and wounded by a musket ball in his thigh. He managed to return to the coast but, the bullet being too deep to remove, gangrene set in, and he died. He was buried in the Clarence cemetery in Fernando Po. He was survived by his wife and daughter. According to a document in the John Holt papers in the Bodleian library (mss air s 1525 Box 11 folder3 p 8) the musket ball is in the Rotunda museum of artillery at Woolwich (Object Class XXX No 172 presented by Col Nichols RM, at whose house Lander died)."]}, {"page": "Royal Niger Company", "response": ["Richard Lander first explored the area of Nigeria as the servant of Hugh Clapperton.

The expedition failed, with 40 of the 49 members dying of fever or wounds from native attacks. One of the survivors, Macgregor Laird, subsequently remained in Britain but directed and funded expeditions to the country until his death in 1861.
