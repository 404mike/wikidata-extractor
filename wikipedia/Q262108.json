Some of these areas (Tilehurst, Calcot, Earley, Winnersh and Woodley) are, at least partly, within West Berkshire or Wokingham Borough. This unusual configuration creates difficulties. The diminishing amount of land available and suitable for development within the borough's boundary can bring the council into conflict with its neighbours' development plans; this is exacerbated by the fact that the wards within the borough boundaries have tended to elect Labour councillors, while the suburban wards outside the borough have tended to vote Conservative. This particularly affects education (many schools have catchment areas that cross administrative boundaries), and transport. A perennial example is whether to construct a third road crossing of the Thames, which South Oxfordshire's politicians and residents oppose.

The Education Funding Authority (EFA) acquired a site (previously residential) in Upper Warren Avenue during 2014, but there was criticism of the choice from local residents. After representations from affected constituents, the local MP, Rob Wilson, intervened. Following discussions with the EFA, Reading Borough Council was commissioned to work with local stakeholders on alternative sites. Five possibilities were proposed \u2013 two parks, a wildlife site, a residential site and a field in adjoining Oxfordshire. The subsequent consultation showed a clear preference for occupying a small part of Mapledurham playing fields (5%).http://beta.reading.gov.uk/media/3300/The-Heights-consultation---Statistical-Result-Summary-with-navigation/pdf/Heights_consultation_-_Statistical_Result_Summary_with_navigation.pdf The consultation is not binding, and there remain some legal difficulties.

However, her disputes with her local party became much more public thereafter. In early 2002, she wrote in The Sunday Times about rampant sexism within the Parliamentary Labour Party.  Subsequently, she alleged she was experiencing bullying by local Labour Party activists in Reading. This was denied by the local Party Chair. The ensuing tensions culminated in Griffiths' deselection as the candidate for the 2005 general election, a first for any MP in ten years.  'Personality issues' were cited, whilst Griffiths contended she was the victim of a conspiracy by '1970s men': her assertion was criticized as 'wild conspiracy theories' in an open letter by seventeen female members of the party. She vowed not to stand as an independent, and the seat fell to a very narrow Labour defeat, with Griffiths being succeeded by Conservative Rob Wilson in 2005. In between her deselection and the end of her term, she fought off suggestions she would defect to the Conservatives."]}, {"page": "Lancing College", "response": ["* Rob Wilson, Minister for Civil Society (Cabinet Office) (2014\u20132017)"]}, {"page": "Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The Reading East parliamentary constituency was first contested in 1983, when it was won by a partial incumbent, Gerry Vaughan, a Conservative who was before that election sitting MP for abolished Reading South.
