A versatile player able to play as a defender or midfielder, he had a twelve-year professional career in the English Football League, playing for Port Vale and Chesterfield, as well as Leicester City. He also played for non-league Stafford Rangers and for American side Fort Lauderdale Strikers.\nHe was voted Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year in 1975\u201376, won the Anglo-Scottish Cup with Chesterfield in 1981, and helped Port Vale to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1982\u201383. Qualifying as a teacher before he began his football career, once he retired he returned to the education profession.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Lee released Freddie Goodwin, and sold Sammy Morgan to Aston Villa for \u00a322,222. He built for the 1973\u201374 campaign by drafting in tall young players David Harris and John Ridley from the youth set-up, as well as versatile Keith Chadwick from Crewe Alexandra. After a spate of injuries, he signed Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. Seemingly taking the club as far as he could, he left Burslem in January 1974 for a club with a much bigger potential. Vale finished the campaign one place and seven points above the relegation zone under the management of Roy Sproson."]}, {"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Promotion was eventually achieved with a third-place finish in 1982\u201383. This was despite McGrath selling Mark Chamberlain and Mark Harrison to Stoke for \u00a3100,000. He made five free signings: John Ridley (a former Valiant), Wayne Cegielski (Wrexham), Les Lawrence (Torquay United), Steve Waddington (Walsall), and Barry Siddall (Sunderland). He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use. With 34 goals conceded, Vale had the best defensive record in the Football League."]}, {"page": "Dennis Butler", "response": ["Following his retirement as a player, he coached at Rochdale and Bury. He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000). After his team were booed he called the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. Vale recorded a \u00a352,000 loss despite a remarkable \u00a3225,000 income from the club's commercial department. Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000. After leaving Burslem, Butler then reunited with Bobby Smith at Swindon, becoming the first team coach before retiring from football in 1980."]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|\u00a355,000||Leicester City||||John Ridley||Midfielder||"]}, {"page": "David Harris (footballer, born 1953)", "response": ["He then fell out of favour, though he was once again a first team regular by March 1975. He posted 22 appearances in 1974\u201375, scoring one goal against Swindon Town. He played 37 games in 1975\u201376, finding the net against Grimsby Town and Southend United.
