Sylvan Muldoon (1936) embraced the concept of an etheric body to explain the OBE experience. The psychical researcher Ernesto Bozzano (1938) had also supported a similar view describing the phenomena of the OBE experience in terms of bilocation in which an \"etheric body\" can release itself from the physical body in rare circumstances. The subtle body theory was also supported by occult writers such as Ralph Shirley (1938), Benjamin Walker (1977), and Douglas Baker (1979). James Baker (1954) wrote that a mental body enters an \"intercosmic region\" during the OBE. Robert Crookall supported the subtle body theory of OBEs in several publications."]}, {"page": "Fertility rite", "response": ["Some authors believe that fertility rites took place around the Kaaba in pre-Islamic times. During the autumn pilgrimage to the Kaaba, rituals performed there included performing the circumambulation naked, holding vigil in front of Mount Arafat, giving offerings to the pillars at al-Mina, and offering sacrifices. According to Barnaby Rogerson, it is likely these rituals were a part of a fertility cult, ensuring continuation of the life-cycle. In the cult, a mother goddess represented by a trinity was worshiped, along with a heroic young god would die and be reborn in an unending cycle due to his father, the supreme god. This was symbolized by agriculture and movement of the celestial bodies in Arabia. Allat was the fertility goddess with al-Rabba (the sovereign), Manat and Al-Uzza being her epithets. Thuraiza or Muzdalifah was the heroic young god and Allah was the father. Benjamin Walker says the Kaaba was honored by orgies and that its name means \"virgin\". Fertility rites took place in the temples of the Great Goddess and the color green was associated with her."]}, {"page": "Khmer Empire", "response": ["* Benjamin Walker, Angkor Empire: A History of the Khmer of Cambodia, Signet Press, Calcutta, 1995."]}, {"page": "George Walker", "response": ["*Benjamin Walker (author) (George Benjamin Walker, 1913\u20132013), author on religion and philosophy, and authority on esoterica"]}, {"page": "Khmer people", "response": ["# Benjamin Walker, Angkor Empire: A History of the Khmer of Cambodia, Signet Press, Calcutta, 1995."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Jesuit educational institutions", "response": ["*Benjamin Walker - Indian-born author on religion and philosophy, and an authority on esoterica in all its forms (St. Xavier's College, Calcutta)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Calcutta people", "response": ["|Benjamin Walker"]}, {"page": "History of Hinduism", "response": ["* Benjamin Walker Hindu World: An Encyclopaedic Survey of Hinduism, (Two Volumes), Allen & Unwin, London, 1968; Praeger, New York, 1968; Munshiram Manohar Lal, New Delhi, 1983; Harper Collins, New Delhi, 1985; Rupa, New Delhi, 2005, ."]}, {"page": "Calcutta Boys' School", "response": ["*Benjamin Walker, Writer"]}, {"page": "Eroto-comatose lucidity", "response": ["As practiced by Ordo Templi Orientis the rite is much simpler as well as a solo effort.
