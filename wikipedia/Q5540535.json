After serving in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force during World War I, Scott went on to command the airship R34 on its return Atlantic crossing in 1919, which marked the first transatlantic flight by an airship and the first east\u2013west transatlantic flight by an aircraft of any kind. Subsequently, he worked at the Royal Airship Works in connection with the Imperial Airship Scheme and took part in a second return Atlantic crossing, this time by the R100, in 1930. He was killed later in the year (along with 47 other people) aboard the R100's near-sister, the R101, when it crashed in northern France during a flight to India.\nIn addition to his achievements as an aviator, Scott made significant contributions to airship engineering, notably in the evolution of the mooring mast.", "link_mentions": {}}}
