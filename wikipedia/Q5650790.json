His popularity did not survive the change in the cultural climate in Germany after World War I, however, and after his death he was soon forgotten. However, in the 1980s interest in his work revived, and a grand retrospective exhibition in 1997 in the City Museum in Freital, Germany, duly restored his reputation as one of the masters of the Dresden art scene around 1910.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bautzen", "response": ["thumb|150px|Hans Unger self-portrait", "* Hans Unger (1872\u20131936), painter"]}, {"page": "Unger", "response": ["* Hans Unger (1872-1936), German artist"]}, {"page": "Dresden Academy of Fine Arts", "response": ["*Hans Unger (1872\u20131936), German painter"]}, {"page": "Osmar Schindler", "response": ["Osmar Schindler was born on December 22, 1867, in the village of Burkhardtsdorf, but grew up in the small town of Bischofswerda (both part of the German Empire), 33\u00a0km east of Dresden. He lost his father at an early age, and so with the support of his uncle, Schindler attended the Dresden Art Academy where he was taught by Ferdinand Pauwels and Leon Pohle with attending students including Sascha Schneider, Hans Unger and Richard M\u00fcller."]}, {"page": "Loschwitz Cemetery", "response": ["Other artistically valuable graves are those of Wilhelm Lachnit and Hans Unger. The imposing monumental sculpture \"Tod mit Bombe\" (\"Death with Bomb\"), designed by Friedrich Press in 1945 for the watchmaker Paul Plei\u00dfner, shows Death carrying a bomb and a scythe. Plei\u00dfner lost his business in the air raids on Dresden, and the monument is also seen today as a memorial to the victims of the Dresden bombing."]}, {"page": "St Jude's Church, Wigan", "response": ["The interior features a mosaic of the crucifixion measuring 17 feet by 9 feet designed by Hans Unger and made by Eberhard Schulze. The Stations of the Cross are represented by a series of mosaics with gold backgrounds designed and made by Earley and Company. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the church is the dalle de verre stained glass on the walls of the nave, designed by Robin Riley, made by Verriers de St Jobain in France and fitted by glaziers J O\u2019Neill and Sons. The abstract, swirling patterns are mainly in blue, red, yellow and green."]}]}}
