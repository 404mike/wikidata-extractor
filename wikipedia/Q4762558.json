She was also the first female squash player to turn professional and was widely recognized for changing the face of women's squash by doing so.\nHer first overseas position was as squash coach at the prestigious Vertical Club in Manhattan, New York, where Vitas Gerulaitis was the tennis pro. Her contract there was said to be the most lucrative of its kind in the sport at that time. There she coached many famous personalities of the time, such as Jackie Kennedy.\nFollowing her successful period in the States and her significant input into the Women's Sport Foundation of America, Smith took up an even greater challenge in Nassau, Bahamas where she took squash from the realms of an expat sport to one embraced by locals. She was instrumental in Shell sponsoring the squash programme. Several of the juniors that Smith coached later went on to play on the world circuit themselves.\nFollowing her six years in Nassau, she was based in Barcelona, Spain at the Can Melich club where she was again a great success, helping to organise amongst other events the European Junior championships. She also coached and helped further develop the game in Hong Kong, Bermuda, Trinidad and Tobago, St Vincent and Kenya. She did all this whilst jetting to and from the UK and world circuits to compete in the necessary events to allow her to represent her country and also maintain her place in the world rankings.\nAfter Smith's immediate success as a professional, making a career from tournament play rather than just coaching, Sue Cogswell followed suit at the end of 1980 and the UK women's squash game was quickly forced to become \"open\"; the rest of the world swiftly followed suit and today's female professionals owe a debt to Smith and those brave enough to join her in those early days, namely the Australians Sue Newman, Barbara Wall and Lyle Hubinger.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Squash Championships", "response": ["|  Angela Smith Vicki Hoffman", "|  Angela Smith Lisa Opie"]}, {"page": "Angela Smith", "response": ["Angela Smith may refer to:", "*Angela Smith (squash player) (born 1953), English professional player and coach", "*Angela Smith, Baroness Smith of Basildon (born 1959), English peer; MP from 1997 to 2010", "*Angela Smith (athlete) (born 1960), English long-distance runner; married name Angela Tooby", "*Angela Smith (South Yorkshire politician) (born 1961), English MP from 2010 to 2019", "*Angela Smith, Mona's rival on the 1999 Canadian children's animated TV series Mona the Vampire"]}, {"page": "Nasrullah Khan (squash player)", "response": ["Nasrullah Khan was a Pakistani squash player.
