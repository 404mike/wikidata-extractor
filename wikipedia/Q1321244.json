There is also an agreement that Ojin's three year conception period is mythical and symbolic, rather than realistic. William George Aston has suggested that this can be interpreted as a period of less than nine months containing three \"years\" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests.Aston, William. (1998). Nihongi, Vol. 1, pp. 224\u2013253. If \u014cjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested. Dates of his actual reign have been proposed to be as early as 370 to 390 AD, to as late as the early 5th century AD. At least one Japanese historian has cast doubt on this theory though, by revising a supporting statement given in 1972. In this new narrative Louis Perez states: \"only kings and emperors after the reign of Ojin... ...are seen as historical figures\". In either case there is also no evidence to suggest that the title tenn\u014d was used during the time to which \u014cjin's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name \u014cjin-tenn\u014d was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations."]}, {"page": "Emperor Y\u016bryaku", "response": ["In 463, Y\u016bryaku Tenn\u014d invited the thunder god of the Mimuro hill to come to the Imperial Palace, and ordered Chiisakobe no muraji Sugaru to fetch the deity. He obliged, thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation, and rode carrying a halberd with a red banner, symbolising his office of royal messenger. Soon enough, the thunder stroke, and Sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage, to be brought in the Emperor's presence, as a great serpent. But, said Emperor neglected to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence. The thunder kami then showed his displeasure through thundering and threatening fiery eyeballs, and Emperor Y\u016bryaku fled into the interior of the Palace while covering his eyes. The great serpent was returned to Mimuro, and the Emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity. This story is recorded in Nihongi and mentioned by William George Aston, in \"Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan\" as well as several other books."]}, {"page": "Haiku", "response": ["Although there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the \"hokku\" in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles. Early Western scholars such as Basil Hall Chamberlain (1850\u20131935) and William George Aston were mostly dismissive of hokku's poetic value."]}, {"page": "1911", "response": ["** William George Aston, British consular official (b. 1841)"]}, {"page": "1841", "response": ["* April 9 \u2013 William George Aston, British consular official (d. 1911)"]}, {"page": "Nara period", "response": ["The Hayato people (\u96bc\u4eba) in Southern Kyushu frequently resisted rule by the Yamato dynasty during the Nara period.William George Aston says this in his note, see Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697, translated from the original Chinese and Japanese by William George Aston.

However, they were eventually subjugated by the Ritsury\u014d."]}, {"page": "Susanoo-no-Mikoto", "response": ["One of the offensive acts Susanoo committed during his rampage was 'skinning backward' (\u9006\u5265, sakahagi) the Ame-no-Fuchikoma (Japanese: \u5929\u306e\u6591\u99d2, \"Heavenly-Piebald Horse\"). Regarding this, William George Aston observed, \"Indian myth has a piebald or spotted deer or cow among celestial objects. The idea is probably suggested by the appearance of the stars.\" Nelly Naumann (1982) meanwhile interpreted the spotted horse as a lunar symbol, with Susanoo's action being equivalent to the devouring or killing of the moon. To Naumann, the act of flaying itself, because it is performed in reverse, is intended to be a magical act that caused death. Indeed, in the Kojiki when Susanoo throws the flayed horse (or its hide) to Amaterasu's weaving hall, one of the weaving maidens injures herself and dies. (In the Shoki, it is Amaterasu herself who is alarmed and injured.) Emilia Gadeleva meanwhile connects Susanoo's act of skinning and flinging the horse with ancient Korean rainmaking rituals, which involved animal sacrifice.Gadeleva (2000). p. 190-191."]}, {"page": "Sprachbund", "response": ["Some linguists, such as Matthias Castr\u00e9n, G. J. Ramstedt, Nicholas Poppe and Pentti Aalto supported the idea that the Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic families of Asia (and some small parts of Europe) are genetically related, in a controversial group they call Altaic. Koreanic and Japonic languages, which are also hypothetically related according to some scholars like William George Aston, Sh\u014dsabur\u014d Kanazawa, Samuel Martin and Sergei Starostin, are sometimes included as part of the purported Altaic family. This latter hypothesis was supported by people including Roy Andrew Miller, John C. Street and Karl Heinrich Menges."]}]}}
