An unexpected 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of Cleveland Internationals at the beginning of June notwithstanding, Outrage's impressive form continued through the middle of the summer; three back-to-back wins over Cincinnati Kings, West Michigan Edge and Fort Wayne Fever kept them well in the hunt for the playoffs. A couple of stutters in the run-in, including two home defeats to Indiana and Michigan Bucks, briefly raised the heart rate in Kalamazoo, but a playoff spot was secured following their 5\u20132 home victory against West Michigan Edge, which featured a hat trick from midfielder Mark Briggs. Outrage entered the playoffs having suffered a 2\u20131 final day defeat, again to Michigan, but impressively overcame Chicago Fire Premier 2\u20130 in the Divisional Round to take their place in the Central Conference tournament in Pontiac, Michigan. Against the run of form, Kalamazoo dispatched hot favorites Michigan Bucks 3\u20131 in their semi final, following a late equalizer from Tom Oatley and two goals in extra time. Despite being beaten 4\u20130 by eventual national champions Thunder Bay Chill in the Central Conference final, Kalamazoo's impressive debut season bodes well for the future. Mark Briggs was the team's top scorer, with 6 goals.
