A right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium pace swing bowler, Johnson made his first-class debut as a teenager in the 1992 County Championship as an opening bowler for Middlesex.  He made headlines in 1994 when he took all ten Derbyshire wickets in their second-innings, returning figures of 10/45.  He moved to Somerset in 2001, and made his Test debut two years later.  He played three Tests and ten One Day Internationals (ODIs) for England in 2003, his only year of international cricket.  He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in October 2007, aged 32. He has since worked as a bowling coach for both Middlesex and Surrey, and as interim head coach for Middlesex. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chertsey", "response": ["*The England cricketer Richard Johnson was born in Chertsey in 1974."]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Bopara could not add to his overnight total on the third day, as he was caught off Richard Johnson's bowling.
