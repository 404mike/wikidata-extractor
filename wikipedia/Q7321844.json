Born in Bridgend, he is a product of the Ospreys academy and played club rugby for Bridgend RFC and Aberavon RFC before breaking into the regional side in 2008. He played for the Ospreys for 10 years before moving to French club Toulon in 2018, but terminated his contract with them in 2020 and agreed a return to the Ospreys; however, he was unable to join the Ospreys immediately and signed for Bath for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season before returning to the Ospreys.\nWebb represented Wales at under-16, under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels, as well as in international rugby sevens, before making his debut for the senior national team in 2012. He played 31 times before the Welsh Rugby Union's selection criteria meant his move to Toulon made him ineligible for further selection; however, his decision to return to the Ospreys in 2020 meant he could again be included in the selection pool. Webb was also selected in the British & Irish Lions' squad for their 2017 tour to New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bridgend", "response": ["* Rhys Webb (rugby player)"]}, {"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["*  Rhys Webb", "* Rhys Webb: (2012\u2013)", "* Rhys Webb: 2017", "*Rhys Webb: (2007\u20132018, 2020\u2013) (177)"]}, {"page": "United Rugby Championship", "response": ["|  Rhys Webb", "| Rhys Webb"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in Wales", "response": ["In 2018 the WRU launched Project Reset to review regional arrangements.
