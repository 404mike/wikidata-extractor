Originally from England, Saint Sigfrid is credited in late medieval king-lists and hagiography with performing the baptism of the first monarch of Sweden, Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. He most likely arrived in Sweden soon after the year 1000 and conducted extensive missions in G\u00f6taland and Svealand. For some years after 1014, following his return to England, Sigfrid was based in Trondheim, Norway. However, his position there became untenable after the defeat of Olaf Haraldsson.While in Norway, Sigfrid continued to participate in the Christianization of Sweden, to which he devoted the remainder of his life. According to Swedish and Icelandic tradition, he retired to V\u00e4rend. Sigfrid later died in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 on an unknown date within the life-time of Adam of Bremen.  Sigfrid's burial-place in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 became the centre of a cult. According to a statement by Johannes Vastovius, an antiquarian writing in the 17th century, Sigfrid was canonized by Pope Hadrian IV c. 1158.  His feast day is 15 February.Sigfrid is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 15 February.", "link_mentions": {}}}
