His brother Thomas W. Fripp also became a watercolourist in Canada and his brother Robert McKay Fripp worked as an architect in Vancouver.\nFripp was an Associate of the Royal Watercolour Society. He painted mainly military subjects and worked as a special artist for The Graphic and The Daily Graphic during various wars in South Africa including the Kaffir War of 1878, the Zulu War, and the Boer War; he also covered the Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u201395 and the Philippines campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War in 1899. He exhibited The Last Stand at Isandhula (sic) and The Attack on General Sir John McNeill\u2019s Force near Suakim at the Royal Academy in 1885 and 1886 respectively. The former is now in the National Army Museum in London, England, while the latter is in the collection of the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regimental Museum at Salisbury, England, having been presented to the Royal Berkshire Regiment in January 1929.\nIn 1889, Fripp visited British Columbia on his way to Japan.

A Zulu account relates the single-handed fight by the guard of Chelmsford's tent, a big Irishman of the 24th who kept the Zulus back with his bayonet until he was speared and the general's Union flag captured. Both the colours of the 2nd 24th were lost, while the Queen's colour of the 1st 24th was carried off the field by Lieutenant Melvill on horseback but lost when he crossed the river, despite Lieutenant Coghill having come to his aid. Both Melvill and Coghill were killed after crossing the river, and received posthumous Victoria Crosses in 1907 as the legend of their gallantry grew, and, after twenty-seven years of steady campaigning by the late Mrs. Melvill (who had died in 1906), on the strength of Queen Victoria being quoted as saying that 'if they had survived they would have been awarded the Victoria Cross'.Lock, p. 222.

A widely reported incident at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, spelled the end of boys being sent on active service by the British Army. Part of the British force returned to their camp at night to find that it had been overrun by the Zulu army a few hours previously. An eyewitness reported that \"Even the little drummer boys that we had in the band, they were hung up on hooks, and opened like sheep. It was a pitiful sight\". Doubt has since been cast on this account, since the youngest drummer to be killed was 18, and the youngest boy present was 16.Ian Knight, Zulu Rising: The Epic Story of iSandlwana and Rorke's Drift, Pan Books 2011  Despite this, Charles Edwin Fripp's famous painting, The Last Stand at Isandlwana, shows a small blond-haired boy amongst the adult soldiers.Ian Knight, Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory, Osprey Publishing Limited 2002,  (p.64)"]}, {"page": "C.
