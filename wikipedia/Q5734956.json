Following an injury to Lock (sustained at Watford's Cassio Road ground), Burrows took over in March 1908 for the rest of the season, but Lock was again preferred for the start of the 1908\u201309 season.

This was the start of a run of 48 consecutive appearances in goal for Burrows, but an indifferent start to the 1910\u201311 season allowed Arthur Brown the opportunity to replace him.
