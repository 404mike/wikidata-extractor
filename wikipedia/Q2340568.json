In one case cited by the UK government, a six-year-old girl was declared Suppressive for failing to disconnect from her mother.

Wallis goes on to say that \"no rigorous discipline is normally involved\" and \"no extensive doctrinal commitment is entailed, at least not at the outset\". Likewise, he writes, \"No one is required to declare a belief in TM, in the Maharishi or even in the possible effects of the technique\". In a later chapter called \"The Precariousness of the Market\", he writes that TM meditators are \"expected to employ the movement's rhetoric and conceptual vocabulary\" and shift from an empirical product [the Transcendental Meditation technique] to a \"system of belief and practice\" [such as the TM Sidhi program] and in this way \"the movement shifts from cult towards sect\". Sociologist Alan E. Aldridge writes that Transcendental Meditation fits Roy Wallis' definition of a \"world-affirming religion\".

More complex studies include Roy Wallis's The Road to Total Freedom.", "Some practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences that they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations. In early 1951, reincarnation became a subject of intense debate within the Dianetics community. Hubbard took the reports of past life events seriously and introduced the concept of the Thetan, an immortal being analogous to the soul. This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the presenting of Scientology as an ostensible religion. Sociologists Roy Wallis and Steve Bruce suggest that Dianetics, which set each person as his or her own authority, was about to fail due to its inherent individualism, and that Hubbard started Scientology, framed as a religion, to establish himself as the overarching authority.", "Dianetics is different from Scientology in that Scientology\u2019s advocates like to frame it as a religion. The purpose of Dianetics is the improvement of the individual, the individual or \"self\" being only one of eight \"dynamics\". According to Hugh B. Urban, Hubbard's early science of Dianetics would be best comprehended as a \"bricolage that brought together his various explorations in psychology, hypnosis, and science fiction\". If Dianetics is understood as a bricolage, then Scientology is \"an even more ambitious sort of religious bricolage adapted to the new religious marketplace of 1950s America\", continues Urban. According to Roy Wallis, \"Scientology emerged as a religious commodity eminently suited to the contemporary market of postwar America.\" L. Ron Hubbard Jr. said in an interview that the spiritual bricolage of Scientology, as written by Hugh B. Urban, \"seemed to be uniquely suited to the individualism and quick-fix mentality of 1950s America: just by doing a few assignments, one can become a god\".", "Academic research into Scientology was for a long time comparatively limited compared to the media and public interest in it.

A handful of monographs and edited volumes followed, while in 2014, the first academic conference on the topic was held in Antwerp, Belgium.
