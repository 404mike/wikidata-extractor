He was born in Peckham, London.\nA right-arm fast-medium bowler and a useful right-handed batsman, he played for Surrey from 1933 to 1949. Despite losing some of what might have been his best years to World War II, he took 729 first-class wickets at 26.06, with best innings figures of 10/67 in the second innings against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1939. He scored 6158 runs at 21.38, including two centuries. His highest score of 123 was made against a powerful Yorkshire attack at Bradford in 1934. The innings included  four 6s and fourteen 4s and took under two hours, as did his only other century.\nHe was the brother-in-law of Alf Gover, with whom he often opened the Surrey bowling. After his cricket career, he ran a sports shop.

Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.Playfair, pp. 92\u201394."]}, {"page": "Angel of Death (wrestler)", "response": ["Returning to Jim Crockett Promotions as one half of the Russian Assassins with Jack Victory, he and Victory feuded with Ivan Koloff who had left Paul Jones' Army during late 1988 eventually defeating Koloff and Junkyard Dog at Starrcade '88.
