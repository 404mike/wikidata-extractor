He was born in Peckham, London.\nA right-arm fast-medium bowler and a useful right-handed batsman, he played for Surrey from 1933 to 1949. Despite losing some of what might have been his best years to World War II, he took 729 first-class wickets at 26.06, with best innings figures of 10/67 in the second innings against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1939. He scored 6158 runs at 21.38, including two centuries. His highest score of 123 was made against a powerful Yorkshire attack at Bradford in 1934. The innings included  four 6s and fourteen 4s and took under two hours, as did his only other century.\nHe was the brother-in-law of Alf Gover, with whom he often opened the Surrey bowling. After his cricket career, he ran a sports shop. He died in Cheam, Surrey at age 69.", "link_mentions": {}}}
