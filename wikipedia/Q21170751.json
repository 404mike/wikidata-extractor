Montgomery works in a \"melancholic post-Situationist\" tradition, primarily in public spaces. He is regarded as a leading figure in the conceptual art world.\nSome of his most famous public forms of poetry have been his white text on a black background pasted onto billboards around London as part of his belief that art and poetry should be taken out of the gallery and into the wider, everyday world be it on a billboard or a bus shelter. When asked by Dr James Fox in BBC Four's Who's Afraid of Conceptual Art? about what it was about the medium of words, rather than pictures that appealed to him, Montgomery replied \"I think there's a certain slowness to words. I think we probably live in an age of accelerated image and we're bombarded with hundreds of images a day and in that context words can be a moment of quiet or pause.\"He said, \"The point of art, is to touch the hearts of strangers, without the trouble of ever having to meet them. But, if you can touch their hearts from a distance and help a little bit from your quiet studio then it's very nice.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Montgomery", "response": ["Robert Montgomery or Bob Montgomery may refer to:", "* Robert Montgomery (poet) (1807\u20131855), English poet and minister", "* Robert Montgomery (actor) (1904\u20131981), American actor and director", "* Robert Montgomery (artist) (born 1972), Scottish artist", "* Robert Montgomery (colonial administrator) (1809\u20131887), Irish-born British Colonial official in India", "* Robert Montgomery Martin {c. 1801-1868), Colonial Treasurer of Hong Kong from 1844-45", "* Robert Montgomery (lawyer) (1930\u20132008), American litigator", "* Robert Montgomery (politician), Republican member of the Kansas House of Representatives", "* Robert Montgomery (sport shooter) (1891\u2013?), Canadian sport shooter at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "* Robert Montgomery (boxer) (born 1983), Canadian super heavyweight boxer who represented Canada at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "* Robert Montgomery (archbishop) (1541\u20131611), Archbishop of Glasgow, 1581\u201385", "* Robert Montgomery (Medal of Honor) (1838\u2013after 1864), American Naval Captain and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Robert Montgomery (British Army officer) (1848\u20131931), British general", "* Robert Montgomery (physician), American transplant surgeon"]}, {"page": "Jenny Holzer", "response": ["* Robert Montgomery"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh College of Art", "response": ["* Robert Montgomery, artist and poet"]}, {"page": "Barbara Polla", "response": ["Since 2017, Barbara Polla had worked on a cultural, artistic and social project aiming to install art by the UK artist Robert Montgomery in the public space of Perama, a city near Athens in Greece where she lived as a teenager.
