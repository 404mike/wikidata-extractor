By late March 1952, plans were made for his return to Trinidad in the summer.  His father put down a quarter of the passage.  However, in early April, in the vacs before the Trinity term, Naipaul took an impulsive trip to Spain, and quickly spent all he had saved.  Attempting an explanation to his family, he called it \"a nervous breakdown.\"  Thirty years later, he was to call it \"something like a mental illness.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Bayley", "response": ["Peter Bayley may refer to:", "* Peter Bayley (poet) ( 1778\u20131823), English writer and poet", "* Peter Bayley (cricketer) (1916\u20131996), West Indian cricketer from British Guiana", "* Peter Bayley (literary critic) (1921\u20132015), British academic, fellow in English at University College, Oxford", "* Peter Bayley (scholar of French literature) (1944\u20132018), British academic of French literature "]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Peter Bayley, 94, academic."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2015", "response": ["*Peter Bayley, 94, English academic.In Memoriam: Peter Bayley "]}, {"page": "Peter Bayley (literary critics)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Bayley (literary critic)"]}, {"page": "He Who Gets Slapped", "response": ["In 1951 the play was mounted using Guthrie\u2019s adaptation at the Watergate Theatre, London with Brian Cobby as Bezano.
