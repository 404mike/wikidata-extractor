He played regularly, mainly at centre half, and also captained the team as he went on to make 101 appearances in the Football League Third Division South. He moved on to Second Division club Luton Town ahead of the 1950\u201351 season, as part of the deal that took Jimmy Mulvaney and Peter Walsh to Brighton, but played little. After two seasons with Kettering Town of the Southern League, he returned to Canada where he won his first Challenge Trophy in 1953 with the Westminster Royals. In 1950, Whent was on a 16-man shortlist in a 1950 Canadian Press poll to select the best players of the previous 50 years."]}]}}
