He has also played for the Scotland national team.\nMartin began his career at Norwich City, joining the club's books at the age of 10 and making his professional d\u00e9but at 18 in the 2006\u201307 season. He fell out of favour in the 2007\u201308 season and spent the 2008\u201309 season on loan at Luton Town. On his return to Norwich, he was an important first team player as the club recorded successive promotions from League One and the Championship in the 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311 seasons.\nHowever, upon the club's return to the Premier League, he found himself out of favour and spent part of the 2011\u201312 season on loan at Crystal Palace and parts of the 2012\u201313 season on loan at Swindon Town and Derby County. At the end of the season, he agreed a deal to join Derby on a permanent basis, signing a three-year contract and moving to the club on a free transfer ahead of the 2013\u201314 season. He ended the season as the club's top goalscorer, with 25 goals in all competitions, as the club reached the 2014 Championship play-off Final. He signed a new four-year contract in August 2014 and was also the club's top goalscorer for the 2014\u201315 season, with 21 goals in all league and cup matches.\nOn 31 August 2016, Martin joined Fulham on a season-long loan, with an arrangement for a permanent deal at the end of the loan spell. This arrangement was disputed during the season, as Martin expressed a desire to return to Derby.\nMartin was eligible to play international football for either England or Scotland, where his father was born. He represented England at under-19 level in 2007. Seven years later he was first selected for the senior Scotland team, for which he made his full international d\u00e9but in May 2014. He scored his first goal for Scotland in October 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beccles", "response": ["* Chris Martin, forward for Bristol City F.C."]}, {"page": "Paolo Di Canio", "response": ["In January 2013, with Swindon under a transfer embargo and in financial difficulty, Di Canio offered to pay \u00a330,000 of his own money to keep loan players John Bostock, Chris Martin and Danny Hollands at the club."]}, {"page": "John O'Shea", "response": ["O'Shea made his Reading debut on 14 August 2018, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 in a 2\u20130 home win against Birmingham City in the EFL Cup.

They grabbed a 2\u20130 win over struggling Tranmere before drawing 2\u20132 away at improving Southampton. They followed this up with a 4\u20131 win over Brighton at home. Grant Holt, Chris Martin and Wes Hoolahan all scored and all three were beginning to rack up the goals for Norwich", "For the second month in succession, Norwich went unbeaten and by the end of December had begun to really put pressure on the top 2. First up was a 3-0 away win at Southend - a ground the Canaries hadn't won at for 57 years. Following a goalless first half, the visitors turned on the style in the second half with a double from talismanic striker Grant Holt and another from academy-product Korey Smith. This was followed up with a routine 2\u20130 home win over Oldham, before what proved to be one of City's most exciting games of the season away at Yeovil. The home side took the lead in the first half through ex-Ipswich striker Dean Bowditch, before Norwich came back in the second half with goals from Chris Martin and Gary Doherty giving the Canaries a 2\u20131 lead. However, Yeovil quickly equalised and then looked to have won it after a 90th-minute goal, before a Russell Martin shot deflected off Gary Doherty in injury-time to ensure a share of the spoils. Two home matches against fellow promotion chasers came next, with Huddersfield Town the first to be dispatched - being defeated 3\u20130 - before a 2-0 Boxing Day success over Millwall left Norwich just 2 points shy of second-placed Charlton.", "January proved to be a pivotal month for Norwich and they started it with a 1\u20130 win away at struggling Wycombe. Although the Canaries dominated the game they failed to make a breakthrough, and indeed were living dangerously at times with the home side coming close to taking the lead but for the width of the post. But Korey Smith eventually struck the winner in the 79th minute to send Norwich second in the league and into the automatic places for the first time this season. City followed this up with a 3\u20131 win at home to Exeter, which meant that they went into arguably their biggest game of the season so far - the return fixture against Colchester (with whom there had been considerable bad feeling brewing since Lambert's departure to Carrow Road) - in solid form. After the 7\u20131 drubbing on the opening day of the season and Paul Lambert's return to Colchester, it had all the makings of a classic. Ultimately though, the match merely served as a way for Norwich to exact fitting revenge, thrashing their hosts 5\u20130 on an extremely waterlogged pitch. A Chris Martin double put City 2\u20130 up at half-time before Gary Doherty, Grant Holt and Oli Johnson made it 5\u20130, with Wes Hoolahan's missed penalty proving not to be costly, whilst Colchester finished the match with 10 men thanks to Ian Henderson's sending off against his former side. On top of handing out a convincing defeat in a local derby, Norwich had now also closed the gap to league-leaders Leeds, and due to the latter's cup commitments, meant that City would usurp Leeds with a win over Brentford in their next match. That task was made more difficult after Grant Holt's sending off in the first half, but they still managed to see out a 1\u20130 win thanks to a Chris Martin goal. The Canaries now sat above Leeds on goal difference, albeit having played two games more. Another late come-from-behind win at Walsall in their next game, coupled with Leeds slipping to defeat, saw Norwich consolidate their position at the top of the table, extending their lead to three points. City ended the month with a 2\u20131 win over Hartlepool at Carrow Road, in a match that would see them record their highest attendance of the season, giving them a perfect record of 6 wins from 6 games in January.", "March was one of Norwich's most important months of the season with 3 games against promotion chasers, including a home game against second place Leeds. City began with an easy 3\u20130 win over Yeovil at Carrow Road but they now faced Huddersfield away who had yet to lose at the Galpharm Stadium that season. City had a poor first half and were 1\u20130 down going into the break. However, City produced a stirring comeback in the second half. Grant Holt, who had a hand in all of the goals, grabbed the equaliser before on-loan striker Stephen Elliot scored two to give City a 3\u20131 win. They followed this up with a 1\u20131 draw against another promotion chasing team, Swindon, and it was then time for the big game against Leeds. The game itself proved to be dull, but City scored another dramatic late winner with Chris Martin coming off the bench to head in the winner. The win meant that with eight games to go, City were 11 points clear of second and third place, with many feeling they were now champions in waiting.", "With promotion and the championship looking all but sealed, it was a case of finishing the job off. City faced struggling Tranmere away and it proved to be one of City's more bizarre games of the season. Tranmere were awarded two debatable penalties in the opening 10 minutes, scoring both, with Fraser Forster also sent off for Norwich. Tranmere added a third with a clear handball. City got a goal in the second half but the damage was already done and the game ended 3\u20131. Norwich faced bottom of the league Stockport three days later. The game ended in a 2\u20131 win but Norwich were not at their best. A few days later, City again had a home game against MK Dons in a fiery affair. The Dons went 1\u20130 up in the first half. City were denied a clear-cut penalty in the second half and the Dons were picking up yellow cards for fun. Chris Martin salvaged a point though in the last minute. Promotion was looking as if it could soon be sealed, but City lost 2\u20131 away at Leyton Orient. However, they had a chance to put this right at Charlton. If results went their way, Norwich could be promoted with a win at the ground they were relegated at last season. City went ahead through a Michael Nelson header in the first half and, after some terrific saves from Fraser Forster, City survived the Charlton onslaught to seal the win. City were finally promoted back to the championship at the first time of asking. Considering the opening day defeat and the 15 point lead Leeds had once held, it was a massive achievement. City only needed 1 point from their remaining three games to seal the title and they beat Gillingham 2\u20130 to seal the championship with two games left."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 FA Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Chris Martin"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["A key point in the season came on 27 February, in a match against Luton Town at Kenilworth Road.

The first was a low finish past City keeper Frank Fielding in the 42nd minute after a mazy run through three defenders; then he intercepted the ball inside his own half and ran through on goal before firing a shot under Fielding in the 63rd minute; his third in the 71st minute was drilled into the bottom corner after a combination with Darren Bent. The result moved Derby up to third in the table and manager Paul Clement praised Ince, saying that \"he's been a little bit inconsistent by his standards so far this season so it was a very good performance from him and will be brilliant for his confidence.\" Ince scored again in the next match, the only goal in a 1\u20130 win at home to Ipswich Town on 19 December. His man-of-the-match performance also saw him provide three good chances, for teammates Bradley Johnson, Chris Martin and Johnny Russell, as well as have a 25-yard free-kick saved by Ipswich goalie Dean Gerken. He missed two good opportunities in the next match, a 2\u20130 win over Fulham on Boxing Day, but atoned against fierce rivals Leeds United on 29 December. He came on in the 76th minute with Derby 2\u20131 down, scoring a \"brilliant\" equaliser just two minutes later, drilling a \"fine finish\" into the bottom corner.", "Ince then endured a difficult spell, not scoring in his next twelve league and cup appearances. After the first seven appearances, during which Derby lost five times, drew twice, only scored three goals and sacked manager Paul Clement, he lost his place in the starting line-up. This coincided with a return to form for the team, who won two of their next three matches, with Ince making second-half substitute appearances. He was restored to the starting eleven on 5 March for a 2\u20130 win against Huddersfield Town and ended his barren spell two matches later on 12 March, scoring a brace either side of a Chris Martin goal to give The Rams a 3\u20130 lead against Rotherham United. However, three late Rotherham goals saw the away side rescue a point. Ince rounded out the season with two more goals: the second in a 4\u20131 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers on 9 April and the 57th-minute winner in a 3\u20132 victory at Bristol City on 19 April. Derby finished the season in fifth place and played fourth-placed Hull City in the play-off semi-finals, losing 3\u20130 at home and winning 2\u20130 away to go out 3\u20132 on aggregate to the eventual play-off Final winners. Ince did not score his first goal of the 2016\u201317 season until 27 September, the first in a 2\u20130 win at Cardiff City. In November, he scored four goals in back-to-back games: braces each in a 3\u20132 win at Wolves on 5 November and in a 3\u20130 win over Rotherham on 19 November. Ince ended the 2016\u201317 season as top scorer with 15 goals as the Rams finished in 9th position."]}]}}
