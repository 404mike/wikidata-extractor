A number of candidates were shortlisted to replace Formby, including Evans, Andrew Fisher, Neena Gill and Byron Taylor, who was considered to be the other candidate most likely to be appointed to the position. Evans was appointed on 26 May 2020, after twenty of the thirty-eight National Executive Committee members voted for him. His appointment was seen as a victory for Starmer, as Evans was described by The Independent as Starmer's \"first choice\" candidate. The Jewish Chronicle described Evans as a \"staunch opponent of hard left politics\" and a \"fierce critic of anti-Zionism\"."]}]}}
