The first was against The Flying Elvises (Jorge Estrada and Sonny Siaki) at the City Auditorium on July 10 and the second defeating Mike Rapada and Big Bully Douglas a week later at the Fairgrounds Coliseum in Nashville, Tennessee. While The Dupps were only together for an eight-week period, they had a notable impact during the first year of the promotion. On the July 24 edition of TNA Impact, Happer's \"bumping\" into Ian Harrison set up an impromptu match ending in a disqualification when Stan Dupp interfered on Bo Dupp's behalf. Another storyline involving The Dupp's was the so-called \"Dupp Cup\" which Happer defended in \"hardcore\" matches, most notably against Ed Ferrara, during his last two months with TNA. On August 14, 2002, in what would be his final appearance with the company, Happer was defeated by Teo in a \"hardcore\" match at Nashville's Fairgrounds Coliseum to win the NWA Dupp Cup. Blade Braxton of Wrestlecrap.com briefly touched on their career during the first year of the company. In 2007, R. D. Reynolds ranked Happer's ring name \"Bo Dupp\" 7 of the top 8 \"Stupidest Ring Names In Wrestling History\" in The Wrestlecrap Book of Lists!.R. D. Reynolds and Blade Braxton.
