He played for hometown club Great Marlow before signing for Small Heath. He made 93 appearances in the FA Cup, Football Alliance and the Football League for the club in its early days. His career was ended prematurely when he broke his leg in a match against Darwen in 1892, the season when Small Heath won the inaugural Second Division championship. Although he played a couple of league games a year later, he retired from the game in 1894. After a sudden breakdown, he died in an asylum in 1909, when he was remembered as \"one of the strongest backs who ever represented the allied counties of Berks and Bucks.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
