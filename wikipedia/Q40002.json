Harry Lloyd and Anjali Jay also departed at the end of the second series.", "The majority of the main characters in Robin Hood are based on the English folk tale of the same name. The title character (Jonas Armstrong) has returned to England after five years fighting in the Third Crusade as part of the King's Guard. He is shocked to find the Sheriff of Nottingham, Vaisey (Keith Allen), running the town with an iron fist upon his return. Robin is soon made an outlaw, and takes it upon himself to steal from the rich to feed the poor along with his gang, which consists of his best friend Much (Sam Troughton); two young men he saved from hanging, Will Scarlett (Harry Lloyd) and Allan A Dale (Joe Armstrong); the ex-leader of a band of outlaws already in the woods, Little John (Gordon Kennedy); and another young man named Roy (short for \"Royston White\") (William Beck), who is killed in episode 4, and replaced in episode 5 by Djaq (Anjali Jay), a Saracen slave using the alias of her dead brother. Robin is pleased to find that Lady Marian (Lucy Griffiths) is still unmarried. It is hinted that they had previously been romantically linked in their youth, prior to Robin leaving to fight in the Holy Land. Their relationship upon his return is strained, but develops into a friendship. Their relationship comes to a dramatic climax in the series one finale, both admitting their love for one another. A love triangle challenges their relationship in series two with Marian becoming closer to the Sheriff's second-in-command, Sir Guy of Gisborne (Richard Armitage). Guy often puts Marian in difficult situations where she has to appear to help him, when actually working to protect Robin and the people of Nottingham. Marian has her own alias,'The night watchman' dubbed by the people she secretly helps; Robin is initially unaware, until her identity is revealed in episode three of the first season. The Sheriff plots to kill King Richard (played by Steven Waddington) in his role as leader of the Black Knights, who wish to place Prince John on the throne. The Sheriff constantly tries to capture or kill Robin and the outlaws for continuously interfering in his scheme to take over England. The second series sees the Sheriff step up his plans to take control, finally culminating in a battle in the Holy Land. As the outlaws foil the Sheriff's attack on King Richard with aid from Marian who is killed by Guy of Gisborne whilst she is protecting the injured King. Robin and Marian are married as she lays dying, with the outlaw gang as witnesses. Djaq and Will, now together, decide to stay in the Holy Land after they encounter a friend of Djaq's uncle.", "The first full reviews for the programme began appearing on 7 September 2006, after a preview of the opening episode had been shown at the press launch the previous evening. The website of The Guardian said that: \"The challenge for the new Robin Hood is to appeal to younger viewers while pulling in their parents as well. It will be no easy task. About as difficult, in fact, as simultaneously firing two arrows from the same bow, and both hitting the target. But as Robin showed in the opening episode, it can be done.\" In The Times, critic Paul Hoggart backed the series to be a success: \"Armstrong as the rather understated Robin Hood should still be moodily cheeky enough to find his way on to the bedroom walls of a few hundred thousand pubertal girls, and Lucy Griffiths as Marian is inevitably feisty. But the villains steal the show, with Richard Armitage's Guy of Gisborne off-setting Keith Allen's gags as the mocking, heavily sarcastic Sheriff. The audience including cast, crew and their friends cheered at the end but this remake should go down well with families at home, too.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Lucy Griffiths, actress (attended Varndean College)"]}, {"page": "Griffiths", "response": ["* Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1919)", "* Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1986)"]}, {"page": "List of Preacher characters", "response": ["| Lucy Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of Robin Hood (2006 TV series) characters", "response": ["Lady Marian of Knighton, (known as Marian) portrayed by Lucy Griffiths, is the daughter of the former Sheriff of Nottingham.
