His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.", "David Wilkie became the key figure in the development of British genre art. After a tour of Europe Wilkie he was increasingly influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting. He became most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp.\u00a084\u20137. His work on themes of Scottish everyday life included Village Politicians (1806), The Blind Fiddler (1806), Distraining for Rent (1815) and The Penny Wedding (1818). His most famous work was The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch, one of the most popular exhibitions in London in 1822. His sketch Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation (1822), dealt with the historic themes that would become a major part of Scottish painting in the second half of the century and he would also be a major influence on oriental painting. Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included John Burnet (1784\u20131868), Alexander George Fraser (1785\u20131865) and Walter Geikie (1795\u20131837). A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included Erskine Nicol (1825\u20131904) and the brothers John (1818\u20131902) and Thomas Faed (1826\u20131900). Major themes included the Reformation, particularly scenes involving John Knox and Mary Queen of Scots, the Covenanters, especially the \"Killing Time\" of the 1680s, and the Jacobites.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp.\u00a096\u20137."]}, {"page": "Theodore Lane", "response": ["Lane first came into notice as a painter of water-colour portraits and miniatures. About 1825 he took up oil painting. He was left-handed, but with the help of Alexander George Fraser became proficient."]}, {"page": "Scottish genre art", "response": ["Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included Erskine Nicol and the brothers John and Thomas Faed. Genre art was a major influence on early photography, which developed rapidly in Scotland with figures such as Hill & Adamson.", "Less well known contemporaries of Wilkie that pursued genre art included William Home Lizars (1788\u20131859), who was a student with Wilkie at the Trustees Academy. He exhibited two genre paintings in 1811: A Scotch Wedding and The Reading of the Will, which demonstrate humour and seem to relate to the early work of Wilkie, who painted his own version of the later in 1820. Shortly after this Lizars turned to engraving for a living.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 180\u20131. William Shiels (1785\u20131857) is mainly known as an animal painter, but he also created genre art. James Howe (1780\u20131836) also undertook genre art with an agricultural dimension. Most influenced by Wilkie were his close friends John Burnet (1784\u20131868), William Allan (1782\u20131850), Alexander George Fraser (1786\u20131865) and Andrew Geddes (1783\u20131844). The first three were all contemporaries of Wilkie at the Academy, while Geddes was self-taught. Burnet and Fraser worked closely with Wilkie in London, while Geddes and Allan stayed in touch with him throughout his career. Allan became Master of the Trustees Academy and later President of Royal Scottish Academy and so was able to pass on Wilkie's influence. He produced genre paintings including Christmas Eve (undated), which is a variation on Wilkie's A Penny Wedding.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 181\u20133."]}]}}
