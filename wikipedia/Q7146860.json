An accident while playing bows and arrows with his two brothers left him with a distinctive scar on his right cheek. He made his stage debut in a 1946 Old Vic production of Richard II at the New Theatre, which was directed by Ralph Richardson and featured Harry Andrews and Alec Guinness. With Old Vic he went on to perform in other Shakespearean plays, including Coriolanus and The Taming of the Shrew, in the last of which also appeared Ren\u00e9e Asherson. Jordan remained friends with Asherson and Guinness.\nJordan's screen roles included several war films, including The Battle of the River Plate (1956), The Longest Day (1962), The Heroes of Telemark (1965), Play Dirty (1969), and Too Late the Hero (1970). He is perhaps best remembered for his uncredited speaking role as Imperial Officer Cass, an aide to Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), in Star Wars (1977), a role secured for him by Guinness, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi. Jordan was offered the choice of either a guaranteed fee for his role, or a small share of the film's royalties. As he was dubious about the film's prospects, he opted for the former, a decision which he later regretted in light of the film's immense success. Jordan's television appearances included Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), (A Disturbing Case, episode); Minder; Angels; Terry and June; Shine on Harvey Moon; Poirot; Crossroads; and The Bill. He retired in 1995.Jordan was married to illustrator Margery Gill from 1946 until her death in 2008. They had two daughters, Tessa and Ros (died 1996). From 1969, he and his wife lived in Alpheton, Suffolk, where he died on 10 January 2020, at the age of 96. He was survived by his elder daughter, four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Star Wars (film)", "response": ["Other actors include Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser as Luke's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru; Jack Purvis, Kenny Baker's partner in his London comedy act, as the Chief Jawa in the film; and Eddie Byrne as Vanden Willard, a Rebel general.
