The ride is formed of a vertical loop, a cobra roll, two corkscrews and five heartline rolls. The ride's rough theme is the ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilization. The music for the ride and surrounding area was composed by Ian Habgood. During planning and construction, Colossus was known as Project Odyssey; both names allude to Ancient Greece, albeit in different ways. In 2009, the ride's lift hill chain was replaced and the station area was cleaned of rust. In 2010, Colossus's signs and station were repainted."]}, {"page": "Habgood", "response": ["*Ian Habgood (born 1974), English composer"]}]}}
