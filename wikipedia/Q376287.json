Bodybuilders such as Greg Kovacs attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like Tom Platz or Paul Demayo for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".

Some time later, Mentzer attracted more attention when he introduced Dorian Yates to high-intensity training, and put him through his first series of workouts in the early '90s.

Years later when Yates won Joe Weider's \"Mr. Olympia\", he credited Mike's \"Heavy Duty\" principles for his training. Mike, his brother Ray, and Dorian formed a clothing company called \"MYM\" for Mentzer Yates Mentzer, also known as \"Heavy Duty Inc\", in 1994. MYM was based on the success of Don Smith's \"CrazeeWear\" bodybuilding apparel. The three principals wanted to capitalize on the physically fit lifestyle, which today has gone mainstream.
