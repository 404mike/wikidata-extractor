During his spell at Oxford, he played 275 league games, and he is seventh highest in the overall list of appearances. Although joining Oxford United in 1959, his transfer didn't officially go through until 1962 when the team joined The Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Turner (footballer, born 1909)", "response": ["There was no automatic promotion into the Football League in those days; clubs had to be elected, and the likelihood of election depended largely on how the chairmen of other league clubs perceived them. That year, Turner persuaded the directors to change the name of the club to Oxford United, to increase public awareness of the club and to broaden its appeal. He employed more professional players, and brought in young players from top clubs. The likes of Graham Atkinson, Cyril Beavon and Maurice Kyle all joined from junior teams of bigger clubs and each went on to play over 300 games for Oxford United. Turner's key signing, the 20-year-old Ron Atkinson, joined from Aston Villa, was soon appointed captain, and went on to play 560 first team games for the club. The combination of Turner's management and Atkinson's captaincy brought two Southern League titles in two years, and when Accrington Stanley went bankrupt in 1962, Oxford United took their place in the Fourth Division of the Football League."]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|August 1962||Maurice Kyle||Wolves||align=right|\u00a35,000", "D.\u00a0 Maurice Kyle was previously on loan from Wolves."]}]}}
