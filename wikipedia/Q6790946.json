He identifies and discusses three different \"conscious arrangements\" all of which \"point to tales #6-#8 as forming the core of the work\". Introduction, pp.17\u201324. Others have preferred to defend individual readings of various fabillis viewed as self-sufficient entities which they argue question the coherence or completeness of that scheme. Finally John MacQueen cites fragmentation in surviving textual witnesses for the poem before 1570 as grounds for caution in asserting with certainty that the overall structure represents Henryson's intention.John MacQueen. Complete and Full with Numbers. Rodopi, Amsterdam. 2006. He discusses textual evidence for the ordering in Appendix B. His book mainly focusses on numerological structures in the individual fabillis. Nevertheless, the above outline describes the structure as received from the 16th century prints and manuscripts which give what the literary scholar Matthew McDiarmid calls the \"accepted text\".Matthew P McDiarmid: Robert Henryson.
