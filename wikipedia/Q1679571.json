He continued to remain involved in the first team in a number of matches since returning to the club, mostly coming on from the substitute bench. But at times, Arca was given starts in the first team in a number of matches. In a match against Cardiff City on 17 December 2011, he set up a goal for Faris Haroun (who scored earlier in the game) to score the winning goal, in a 3\u20132 win. In a 3\u20131 loss against Coventry City on 21 January 2012, Arca was sent\u2013off at the last minute of the game for a foul on Sammy Clingan. After serving three matches, he returned to the first team in the starting line-up, in a 2\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest on 14 February 2012. In a follow\u2013up against Millwall, Arca set up a goal for Curtis Main to score the third goal of the game, in a 3\u20131 win.
