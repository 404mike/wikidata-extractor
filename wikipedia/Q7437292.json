He plays as a striker. He has also represented England U19s and the England C national teams.\nDescribed as a 'wonderkid', he started his career at Oldham Athletic at the age of 10 working his way through the club's centre of excellence. In 2006, he moved to Everton for a fee of \u00a3220,000 and had loan spells with Yeovil Town and Macclesfield Town before being released by Everton just three years later in 2009. He then joined Rochdale on non-contract terms, later joining Southend United. He stayed for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season and the start of the 2010\u201311 season, subsequently joining Lincoln City for the rest of the season before being released following the club's relegation from the Football League. After several trials, he eventually signed for Hyde. He received his first call-up to the England C national team in August 2011 whilst at Hyde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Sturrock", "response": ["Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season, with only Anthony Grant, Matt Paterson and Scott Spencer surviving. He soon appointed new signing Craig Easton, who he had previously managed at Swindon Town, as captain while another player from one of Sturrock's old clubs, Chris Barker, was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day. It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, Tommy Widdrington left for \"footballing reasons\" on Wednesday 15 December 2010. After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011\u201312 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign. Sturrock was named Manager of the Month for September 2011 by the Football League."]}, {"page": "England national football C team", "response": ["|Scott Spencer, Andre Gray"]}, {"page": "Scott Spencer", "response": ["Scott Spencer may refer to:", "* Scott Spencer (writer) (born 1945), American writer", "* Scott Spencer (footballer) (born 1989), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Scott Spencer", "|  Scott Spencer"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Spencer", "response": ["* Scott Spencer (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "**Scott Spencer (writer) (born 1945), American writer", "**Scott Spencer (footballer) (born 1989), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["* Scott Spencer: Former Everton forward who scored against Hungerford Town.
