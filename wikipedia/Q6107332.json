Pratt, who was investigating the story. Fegan said that although Darwin had certainly been an agnostic, he was also \"an honourable, courteous, benevolent gentleman.\"  In contrast, Fegan noted that after Hope had been \"adjudicated bankrupt,\" she had asked him for \"a commendatory letter to take with her to America, and it was my painful duty to tell her that I did not feel I could do so.\"Letter reprinted in Moore, 160-61. L. R. Croft has disputed the reliability of this letter on the grounds that as a member of the English aristocracy, Lady Hope would have had little need for a commendatory letter from Fegan.

After his parents' marriage failed, he was taken into care by Fegan Homes (founded by the nonconformist evangelist J. W. C. Fegan) and immigrated to Canada in 1906. Contrary to Fegan's policy of placing young boys on farms to serve as labourers, Maxted boarded as a teenager with the family of Dr. Malcolm Sparrow, a prominent dentist and amateur tenor residing in the Parkdale district of Toronto. Living with the Sparrows afforded Maxted the opportunity to attend Toronto's Parkdale Collegiate Institute, where he won two scholarships and excelled in sports. Maxted also reportedly studied singing privately under the tutelage of the renowned voice instructor Otto Morando."]}]}}
