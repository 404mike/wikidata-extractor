Cicala afterwards served on the China station, acting against pirates.  She was at Hong Kong when the Japanese invaded in 1941 and provided fire support for the unsuccessful British defence.

Other British vessels had run aground in shallow waters and come under attack from the batteries, gun barges, floating mines and aircraft.  Rear Admiral John Green ordered the other ships in his squadron to turn their guns on the Cicala and threatened to open fire, after which the mutineers backed down and obeyed the orders.  Green's senior officer, Rear Admiral Walter Cowan, was uncertain if the crew could be tried for mutiny as it was a wartime-only offence and Britain had not formally declared war against the Bolsheviks.  The Admiralty in London confirmed that charges could be brought and Cowan's court-martial sentenced five ringleaders to death, afterwards commuted to five years imprisonment."]}]}}
