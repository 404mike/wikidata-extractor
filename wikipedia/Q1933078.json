He also attempted to copy the famous \"old Faithful\" bike used by Graeme Obree, to be used as a spare in an attempt on the world hour record. However the bike was not liked by Obree and not used in any record attempt.Burrows has long been involved in the recumbent bicycle/tricycle world, having designed the Speedy or Windcheetah trike and more recently the  Ratcatcher, Ratracer and Ratracer B. He has collaborated on projects with Richard Ballantine.\nHe is also involved in utility cycling and has designed a folding cycle (the Giant Halfway), an especially thin machine (the 2D) that takes up little space in a hallway, the 8-Freight freight bicycle in use with cycle courier companies such as Outspoken Delivery, and makes customised screen and PA carrying freight bikes with extendable \"batwings\" for AV2 Hire.\nIn the 1990s, Burrows worked for Giant Bicycles and designed the compact frame TCR road bike among others, the bike design was truly revolutionary, to minimise bike manufacturing cost.\nBurrows' designs often feature cantilever suspended wheels. He supplied a bike fitted with a front monoblade to television science presenter Adam Hart-Davis, which featured in some of Hart-Davis' programmes.  Hart-Davis also owned a Speedy, finished in pink and yellow.\nMike is currently involved with the design of a recumbent that could break the speed record for an HPV. The design Aim 93 will attempt to break the record at the International HPV Association's world championships at Battle Mountain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Freight bicycle", "response": ["* Mike Burrows, designer of the 8 Freight"]}, {"page": "Chris Boardman", "response": ["Boardman is also notable for having used the Lotus 108 time trial bicycle designed by Mike Burrows and built by the sports car manufacturer Lotus.

", "Three years later, in 1990, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) revoked its previous ban on monocoques. By this time Mike Burrows had lost enthusiasm for the concept and was focusing his attention on recumbent bicycles. However, his Mk2 Monocoque caught the attention of a keen local cyclist (and Lotus Engineering employee), Rudy Thomann. Aware of the revocation of the ban, Thomann took Burrows's design to Lotus Engineering. and presented it to his boss, Roger Becker. Roger could immediately see the potential of the design. Not only did it offer the opportunity for Lotus to utilize its expertise and diversify into a new market, but it also offered a morale lift to Lotus\u2019s beleaguered workforce, which was suffering from the effects of the early 1990s recession."]}, {"page": "Burrows (surname)", "response": ["* Mike Burrows (b. 1943), English bicycle designer"]}, {"page": "Michael Burrows (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Mike Burrows, bicycle designer"]}]}}
