He travelled twice to South Africa to consult with Fearon Fallows on the design of the observatory.  In 1828 he was made Superintendent of the Observatory.  In 1835 he published A Catalogue of 606 Principal Fixed Stars in the Southern Hemisphere... at St. Helena, for which he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society that same year. While comparing his results with those of Nicolas Louis de Lacaille he noted the high proper motion of Alpha Centauri and communicated these to Thomas Henderson at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope. This led to the first successful measurement of a stellar parallax, though not to the first publication thereof.On his return to the UK in 1833 he went up to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduating MA in 1839. He then served as director of the Radcliffe Observatory from 1839 until his death in Oxford in 1859. He introduced there self-registering meteorological instruments to continuously record variations in atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and atmospheric electricity using the recent invention of photography.  The initial instruments were invented and installed by Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory.  The Radcliffe Observatory later became part of the network of observing stations established as part of the new Meteorological Office and coordinated from Kew. \nJohnson was president of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855\u20131857 and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1856.\nIn 1850 he had married Caroline, the daughter of Dr James Ogle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alpha Centauri", "response": ["The large proper motion of Alpha Centauri AB was discovered by Manuel John Johnson, observing from Saint Helena, who informed Thomas Henderson at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope of it. The parallax of Alpha Centauri was subsequently determined by Henderson from many exacting positional observations of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld his results, however, because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published them in 1839 after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for 61 Cygni in 1838. For this reason, Alpha Centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because Henderson's work was not fully acknowledged at first. (The distance of Alpha Centauri from the Earth is now reckoned at .)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Henderson (astronomer)", "response": ["Henderson was passed over for that position, but the recommendation was enough to get him a position at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. There he made a considerable number of stellar observations between April 1832 and May 1833, including those for which he is remembered today. It was pointed out to him by Manuel John Johnson of the East India Company's observatory on Saint Helena that the bright southern star Alpha Centauri had a large proper motion, and Henderson concluded that it might be relatively close."]}, {"page": "42 Isis", "response": ["Isis, minor planet designation: 42 Isis, is a large main-belt asteroid, measuring 100.2\u00a0km in diameter with a stony (S-type) composition. It was discovered by English astronomer N.R. Pogson on 23 May 1856 at Oxford, and was his first asteroid discovery. The asteroid's name was chosen by Manuel John Johnson, director of the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford. Although Isis is the name of an Egyptian goddess, the name was chosen in homage to Pogson's astronomer daughter, (Elizabeth) Isis Pogson. In addition, the Isis is the stretch of the River Thames that runs through Oxford."]}, {"page": "Manuel J.
