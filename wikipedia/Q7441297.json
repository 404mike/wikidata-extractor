He also stated that \"if I didn't take the job, this club would've had a real chance of dying... I'm not proud to be the manager of a club that loses 7\u20130... but this is my team now... It has always been my club, so it's my responsibility to make things better, and over time we will.\" He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3\u20132 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The \"Hatters\" secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1\u20131 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return. Stockport finished the campaign in 16th place, 10 points above the drop and 20 points below the play-off zone.", "In preparation for the 2012\u201313 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that \"I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes are going to be made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which quite frankly is not good enough.\" Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3\u20131 home defeat by Mansfield Town."]}, {"page": "Steve Jones (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["After a short spell with Droylsden, Jones signed for Conference National side AFC Telford United on 18 November 2011. He made his debut the following day in the 0\u20130 draw against Mansfield Town, he came on for Craig Farrell after 61 minutes and almost scored with his first touch, but his effort was well saved by Mansfield goalkeeper Alan Marriott. On 26 November, he came off the bench in the 1\u20130 win against Barrow, replacing Sean Newton after 68 minutes and scoring his first goal for the club. He headed in a Richard Davies cross on 76 minutes to give The Bucks their first league win in 9 outings. He made his first start for the club in the 1\u20131 draw against Luton Town three days later. Jones scored in the 2\u20132 draw with Stockport County on 24 January 2012. In the 0\u20130 draw with Alfreton Town on 3 March, Jones suffered a knee ligament injury that would keep him out of action for up to six weeks. He made his return from injury on 17 April, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute in the 1\u20130 win against Tamworth. The win secured Telford's place in the Conference National for the following season. On 4 May, it was announced on Telford's website that Jones had agreed terms to a contract extension with the club."]}, {"page": "Droylsden F.C.", "response": ["In the 2008\u201309 FA Cup, Droylsden beat League Two side Darlington, 1\u20130 in a replay earning themselves a place in the Second Round Proper against Chesterfield. On 23 December they beat Chesterfield 2\u20131 after three previous attempts to play the match. The first game was abandoned at half time, with Droylsden leading 1\u20130, because of fog which restricted visibility to less than fifty yards, the second was a 2\u20132 draw, then the replay at Droylsden was abandoned after the floodlights failed on 72 minutes with Chesterfield leading 2\u20130. In the final replayed game Droylsden won 2\u20131, with defender Sean Newton scoring twice for Droylsden to secure the club a third round tie against Ipswich Town. However, it emerged after the game that Newton was due to serve a one-game suspension on the day after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season on 9 December. Droylsden had been informed of the suspension by the Football Association on 10 December. This meant that Newton was ineligible to play in the game against Chesterfield. The FA investigated the incident with the matter dealt with by an FA Cup committee on 29 December, after which the three clubs involved were informed of the decision,"]}, {"page": "England national football C team", "response": ["|Paul Brown, Lee Tomlin, Sean Newton, Shaun Densmore"]}, {"page": "York City F.C.
