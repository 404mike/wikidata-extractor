Isa is the third resident of Jack and Victor's landing in Osprey Heights. She is known as the local gossip, as she confesses in \"Gairden\" by saying she is a \"nosy bastard\" and will stop at nothing in her quest to find out the latest news. Isa works as a cleaner in Navid's shop, and she is shown to be a practising Roman Catholic. She has an estranged husband named Harry who frequently carried out illicit affairs with younger women while they were together. In the episode \"Gairden,\" she mentions that she has a son named Colin. In \"Dug\" and \"Hoaliday\", she had a pretend relationship with Winston; although unrequited, Isa has a secret flame for Winston but her obsession with gossip and tendency to be nosy often sabotages her chances with him, as he finds these qualities highly irritating. Isa is heavily involved with community projects and charities, attends dance classes and enjoys aiding others. Winston maintains this is her way of keeping in touch with people to 'keep on tap with everyone's business.' Despite the fact that many people outwardly profess to be annoyed by Isa, she is still regarded as a vital member of the community, with the other pensioners immediately leaping to defend her if they feel she is being treated unjustly.
