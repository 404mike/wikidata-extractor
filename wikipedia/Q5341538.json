Her only child Muriel Agnes Arber was born in 1913, became a geologist, and died in 2004. Arber and her husband had many interests in common, and her marriage was described as 'happy'. Arber was awarded a Research Fellowship from Newnham College in 1912 and published her first book Herbals, their origin and evolution in the same year. Her husband Newall Arber died in 1918 following a period of ill health. Arber never remarried, but continued with her research. She studied in the Balfour Laboratory for Women from her marriage until the laboratory's closure in 1927. Arber maintained a small laboratory in a back room of her house from then until she stopped performing bench research in the 1940s and turned to philosophical study."]}, {"page": "Clare Island Survey", "response": ["*Part 7 Geology   Edward Alexander Newell Arber and Timothy Hallissy", "Nonpublishing participants John Adams (naturalist) (Marine algae); Edward Alexander Newell Arber (Geology); James Bayley Butler (Protozoa); Frederik B\u00f8rgesen (Marine algae); George W.
