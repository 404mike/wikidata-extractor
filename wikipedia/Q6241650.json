He was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on 12 July 1848. A short time later, he served as a missionary for the church in Stratford-on-Avon.\nJaques crossed the Atlantic with his wife in 1856 on the Horizon. They landed at Boston and proceeded by train to Iowa City. There they joined the Martin Handcart Company. Jaques' oldest daughter was among the many in that company who died when they were caught in snowstorms in Wyoming.\nJaques wrote many poems and other works, including \"Truth.\" As a young missionary in Stratford-on-Avon he contemplated Pilate's question to Jesus Christ \"What is truth?\". The poem was included in the first (1851) edition of the Pearl of Great Price. It was also set to music by Ellen Knowles Melling, whom Jaques baptized while preaching in Scotland. Entitled \"Oh Say, What is Truth?\", the hymn is included in the hymnal of the LDS Church.\nIn 1869 Jaques returned to England for a two-year mission. He co-edited the Millennial Star with George Teasdale and then from 1870 to 1871 he served as the sole editor of that publication. Jacques also wrote a catechism to teach the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This was a very respected and popular compendium of Latter-day Saints doctrine in the early period of Church headquarters being in Utah. It is one of the sources that declare God having a specific place to live but still being omnipresent based on the influence and range of the Holy Ghost.After returning to Utah Territory, Jaques began working for the Deseret News. In 1874 he became the principal editorial writer for this newspaper. He then served as an Assistant Church Historian starting in 1873. While in this position he was on a committee with A. Milton Musser and Franklin D. Richards that presented plans for a Genealogical Association of the church. This association was the forerunner of the Family History Library in Salt Lake City. After the Genealogical Society of Utah was organized, Jaques served as its first librarian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deseret alphabet", "response": ["The Mormons had planned to use the profits from sale of the earlier books to fund printing of more books, and in anticipation Orson Pratt had already transcribed the complete Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and John Jaques's Catechism for Children.

After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a storage area of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967."]}, {"page": "Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)", "response": ["*\"Truth\" (a poem by John Jaques) (\"O Say, What is Truth?\", #272 in LDS Church hymnal) (not a canonized work)"]}, {"page": "Mormon handcart pioneers", "response": ["*John Jaques \u2013 Member of the Martin Company, missionary, and company historian"]}, {"page": "Jaques", "response": ["* Rev John Jaques (priest) (1728\u20131800), British clergyman who became prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral", "* John Jaques (Mormon), American Latter Day Saint hymnwriter, missionary, and historian"]}, {"page": "Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)", "response": ["| 56 ||  Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning || John Jaques || J.
