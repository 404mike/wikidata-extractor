In 1999, he signed a professional contract, before joining Third Division club York City in 2001. In the 2001\u201302 season, Smith did not establish himself as a first-team regular, but in 2002\u201303 became a fans' favourite. However, 2003\u201304 saw York relegated to the Conference National, and after being released by the club he spent a season with Stafford Rangers in the Conference North. In 2005, Smith joined their divisional rivals Worcester City, and in 2006\u201307 was named the club's Player of the Year. After a third season at Worcester, in which he was captain, the club was re-allocated to play in the Conference South.\nSmith signed for Tamworth in 2008, winning the Conference North title in 2008\u201309, and thus promotion to the Conference Premier. After serving 2009\u201310 as captain, he signed for Tamworth's divisional rivals Mansfield Town in 2010. Later that year, he rejoined Conference Premier club York, initially on loan, and was immediately appointed captain. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final and 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final, both staged at Wembley Stadium, the latter seeing the club promoted to League Two. Having helped York avoid relegation in 2012\u201313, he fell out of favour the following season, joining Conference Premier club FC Halifax Town in 2014.
