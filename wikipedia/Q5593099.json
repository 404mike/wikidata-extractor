In 2009, Graham Nicholls founded www.polyamory.org.uk, the United Kingdom's first website about polyamory and the Mom of Pina in Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli's novel, Love You Two was shown to be polyamorous and bisexual, leading Pina on a journey to explore the \"complex spectrum of sex and love\" in humanity itself. In 2010, the series Lost Girl began. It included Bo Dennis, a bisexual succubus which must sustain herself by feeding from the life force of male and female Fae and humans, via oral intake or the energy created through sex. In the first two seasons she was involved romantically with Dyson (a heterosexual shapeshifter) and Lauren (a lesbian human). Later on, Bo tried to have a monogamous relationship with Lauren, with Bo and Lauren remaining in love with each other through ups and downs, and later accepting each other as a couple by the end of the series."]}, {"page": "1975", "response": ["* July 30 \u2013 Graham Nicholls, British artist"]}, {"page": "Electronic art", "response": ["* Graham Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of contemporary artists", "response": ["* Graham Nicholls (born 1975), installation artist"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Graham Nicholls (born 1975)"]}, {"page": "1975 in art", "response": ["* 30 July \u2013 Graham Nicholls, British installation artist, activist and speaker."]}, {"page": "List of video artists", "response": ["* Graham Nicholls"]}, {"page": "Nicholls (name)", "response": ["* Graham Nicholls (born 1975), English artist", "* John Graham Nicholls (born 1929), British/Swiss physiologist"]}, {"page": "Lennie Lee", "response": ["After returning to London, he set up a new art collective known as the 'Department of Hate and Social Sickness', (DHSS) in spring 1992.
