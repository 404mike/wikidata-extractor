Only in 1157 did the twists and turns of the Investiture Controversy lead to the practice of calling the Empire, though not the Emperor himself, \"holy\" (sacrum).Peter Moraw, Heiliges Reich, in: Lexikon des Mittelalters, Munich & Zurich: Artemis 1977\u20131999, vol. 4, columns 2025\u20132028. The reference to Germany (Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation, Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanic\u00e6), which first appeared in the late 15th century, was never much used in official Imperial documents,Peter H. Wilson, \"Bolstering the Prestige of the Habsburgs: The End of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806\", in The International History Review, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Dec. 2006), p. 719. and even then was a misnomer since the Empire's jurisdiction in Italy had not entirely disappeared. Other colloquial designations in the early Modern era included \"German Empire\" () or \"Roman-German Empire\" (). ", "The coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III, in Rome on Christmas Day 800, was explicitly intended as establishing continuity with the Roman Empire that still existed in the East. In Constantinople, Irene of Athens had blinded and deposed her son Emperor Constantine VI a few years earlier. With no precedent of a woman being sole holder of the imperial title, her critics in the West (e.g. Alcuin) viewed the imperial throne as vacant rather than recognizing her as Empress. Thus, as Peter H. Wilson put it, \"it is highly likely Charlemagne believed he was being made Roman Emperor\" at the time of his coronation. Charlemagne's imperial title, however, rested on a different base from any of the Roman emperors until him, as it was structurally reliant on the partnership with the Papacy, embodied in the act of his coronation by the Pope.

Wilson argues \"none of the major powers...was looking for a fight in Italy\" and conflict was caused by a combination of events, including miscommunication between C\u00f3rdoba and Madrid, as well as Nevers' refusal to compromise. Despite their family connections, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs did not necessarily share the same objectives. While Spain was always seeking to strengthen its position in Northern Italy, Ferdinand wanted to avoid diverting resources from Germany, as well as to assert Imperial authority by deciding the succession question himself. He agreed to confirm Nevers as duke in return for the newly built fortress of Casale Monferrato, capital of Montferrat, a compromise suggested by his wife Empress Eleonora, sister of the recently deceased duke Vincenzo II. "]}, {"page": "Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg", "response": ["The rules of the Baroque dukes, Eberhard Louis, Charles Alexander, and Charles Eugene, were an unstable period in the musical scene in the Duchy based at the palaces of Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart (much like the Dukes that patronized those arts) that illuminates three central themes in the history of music in the West: the emergence of the orchestra, importance of chamber music and the growing number of Italian composers and musicians employed at the courts of German princes in the 18th century. Although the Duchy was recognized by Peter H. Wilson as \"one of the weaker middle ranking territories within the Empire,\" the Dukes went to great - and expensive - lengths by the Ducal Court to be ahead of the cultural curve. The result, in the final years of the 17th century, was an increasing awareness and then desire for French style and fashion, resulting in the employment of French musicians, adoption of new Baroque woodwinds, putting on of large-scale French-style ballets de cour called Singballete and the institution of a Lullian string band that paved the way for appearance of the orchestra at court. Even in the face of periodic French aggression in the 18th century, Duke Eberhard Louis, educated with French style and mannerisms, strove to make his court a haven for French culture. At the turn of the 18th century, W\u00fcrttemberg's musical interests, like many other European states, began turning to Italy, which can be seen in the productions of Johann Sigismund Kusser from 1698 to 1702. Musical funding would, unfortunately, come to a sudden end with the War of Spanish Succession and it would have an indelible impact on music at the court in later years."]}, {"page": "Society for Military History", "response": ["* Peter H.
