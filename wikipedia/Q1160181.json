The family returned to St Petersburg illegally, where his sister Vera Broido was born in 1907.\nHe moved to Germany and studied mechanical engineering in Berlin, and found work as an engineer working for Rotaprint. In 1934 Rotaprint sent him to London, where he settled. He remained in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, working for Caterpillar Tractors during World War II.\nIn 1956, Broido was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer to work on the LEO computer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Raoul Hausmann", "response": ["In addition to his work as an artist, Hausmann was interested in science and technology throughout his career, especially emerging fields like television and sound film, and Einstein's work on relativity (which Hausmann rejected).Ether Machines: Roaul Hausmann's Optophonetic Media, Arndt Niebisch, p162 In 1929, he received a patent for a \"device for monitoring body cavities and tubes,\" which today we would call an endoscope (patent number DRP473166).
