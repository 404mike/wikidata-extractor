His uncle Johnnie Faughey fought in the Irish War of Independence in the early 1920s. McAllister joined Sinn F\u00e9in in 1962 and moved to England later in the decade.  He returned to South Armagh in 1974, and rejoined Sinn F\u00e9in.  During the 1981 Irish hunger strike, he became a full-time activist.At the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, McAllister was elected in Armagh.  He stood for the Westminster seat of Newry and Armagh at the 1983 general election, taking 20% of the votes cast, but his vote share fell to 13.2% at the 1986 Newry and Armagh by-election, and to 11.8% at the 1987 general election.McAllister was also elected to Newry and Mourne District Council, representing Slieve Gullion, at the 1985 Northern Ireland local elections, a seat he held in 1989 and 1993.  He left Sinn F\u00e9in in the 1990s, in protest at their advocacy of a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire and their participation in the Northern Ireland Assembly.Described by author Toby Harnden as \"the authentic voice of republicanism in South Armagh,\" McAllister supported the end of the IRA ceasefire in February 1996. He said: \"Within active republicans the feeling became as those months passed by that there was definitely nothing going to come out of it. And the feeling then became: 'Give it another month, give it another two months, then we'll see.' When Canary Wharf [Docklands] did come there was no great sadness; it was what they expected. And there was also very, very strong attitude amongst the people here that that's the place for the bombs: 'London, keep them over there. I don't want one, I've had enough of them, bang it out to hell over there.' Genuinely there was no great sorrow for London. None.\"\nLater, however, he opposed the direction in which Sinn F\u00e9in was leading the Irish republican movement. In 1998, he stated: \"There's an unsureness of where we're going, even a questioning of who we are, which is a new thing. I've read the damn thing [the Good Friday Agreement] and I believe it offers nothing whatsoever for republicans. To say this deal is transitional towards a united Ireland, that is bollocks. people had a genuine belief that this was an attempt to address the core issue of the British presence, which it never was.\" He subsequently felt he was being restricted in what he could say.  Having been advised that he should have his opinion approved before speaking he stood down.  He spoke his mind and this no longer suited Sinn F\u00e9in so he left the party.\nIn the 2000s, McAllister campaigned against what he viewed as Provisional IRA intimidation in south Armagh.  In 2008, his son, Turloch McAllister, was charged with possessing explosives and alleged involvement in a dissident republican group. He was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to 12 years for grinding down fertiliser to be used in making pipe bombs.He died on 9 April 2013 of cancer at his home. His son Turloch was eventually allowed compassionate leave for the funeral at Cullyhanna, South Armagh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McAllister (surname)", "response": ["*Jim McAllister (1944\u20132013), Irish activist and politician"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Jim McAllister"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Jim McAllister"]}, {"page": "1985 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Jim McAllister"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2013", "response": ["*Jim McAllister, 68, Northern Irish politician, cancer.Ex-councillor and staunch Irish republican politician Jim McAllister dead at 68|irishnews.com "]}, {"page": "McAllister, Jim", "response": ["#redirectJim McAllister"]}, {"page": "James McAllister", "response": ["James or Jim McAllister or McAlister may refer to:", "* Jim McAllister (1944\u20132013), Northern Irish activist and politician", "* Jim McAllister, lead character in the 1999 American film Election"]}, {"page": "Jimmy MacAlister", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister "]}, {"page": "Jim MacAlister", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister "]}, {"page": "Jim MacAllister", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister "]}, {"page": "Jimmy MacAllister", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister "]}, {"page": "James MacAllister", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister "]}, {"page": "Jim McAllister (Irish republican)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim McAllister"]}]}}
