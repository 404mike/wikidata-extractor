He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England, and at club level for Moseley Rugby Football Club, as a Wing, i.e. number 11 or 14, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain and England, and at club level for Salford, as a wing, i.e. number 2 or 5.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1975 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["England winger Keith Fielding created a new record by scoring four tries against a hapless French team at Bordeaux.", "*  Keith Fielding"]}, {"page": "Bramhall", "response": ["* Keith Fielding \u2013 Former England and Great Britain international rugby player  "]}, {"page": "Superstars (British TV programme)", "response": ["1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower Tim Crooks beat shot putter Geoff Capes in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to Fran\u00e7ois Tracanelli in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was Rugby league player Keith Fielding, who finished a close second, matching Hemery's best ever performance by a British Superstar.", "To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off \"Challenge of the Champions\" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two \"Past Masters\" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.", "The key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others \u2013 simple in theory, but appallingly hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot that his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks' strategy by enough to beat him.", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Keith Fielding", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Keith Fielding", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Keith Fielding", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Keith Fielding", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Keith Fielding", "Though the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by Jean-Paul Coche, Keith Fielding and Ties Kruize, while Wayne Grimditch, Greg Pruitt and Dwight Stones (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US.  It was the Canadian champion however, Brian Budd, who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.", "In the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start \u2013 according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was 'a flyer' \u2013 and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together.  Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from Ron Pickering at track-side."]}, {"page": "England national rugby league team", "response": ["|Keith Fielding", "::Keith Fielding v.
