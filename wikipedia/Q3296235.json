Gradually, the telescope became a visitor attraction. But it was not until the 1990s that plans to actually rebuild the telescope came to fruition. In 1994 the retired structural engineer and amateur astronomer Michael Tubridy was called in to research and re-design the Rosse six-foot telescope. The original plans were lost, and so it took detective work to review the remains of the telescope, incidental comments in observing logs, and contemporary photographs taken by Mary Rosse, wife of the 3rd Earl. Reconstruction work lasted from early 1996 to early 1997. It had been planned to include a working mirror, but due to budget constraints this had to be left for a separate project."]}, {"page": "Mary rosse", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Rosse "]}, {"page": "Henry Ward, 5th Viscount Bangor", "response": ["On 6 December 1854, he married the Irish entomologist, michroscopist, and writer Mary King, a cousin of the astronomer and naturalist William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, and the pioneering photographer Mary Rosse.
