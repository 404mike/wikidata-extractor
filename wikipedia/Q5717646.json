The name of the river is believed to derive from the term \"devil's neckcloth\", a slang term for the hangman's noose. In London Past and Present, published in 1891, Henry B. Wheatley argued that there was 'much good evidence' that 'the 'Devil's Neckinger'... the ancient place of punishment and execution' was at the site of the 'Dead Tree public-house' on Jacob's Island. Writing in The Inns of Old Southwark And Their Associations, in 1888, authors William Rendle and Philip Norman note that a place called Devol's Neckenger appears on a map in 1740 and, in the same location, in 1813, the Dead Tree inn.

Whittington biographer Lysons felt it stood there as a marker for \"many centuries\", even if it was actually just the debris of an old cross with only the plinth or base remaining, as some had suggested. Henry B. Wheatley argued that Whittington's association to \"Holloway\" must have been a later embellishment, as it is lacking in the early T. H. text (in which the boy only goes as far as Bunhill, just north of London). He thus does not think the stone could be dated anywhere near-contemporaneously to Whittington's lifespan, but he does allow that a purported stone was removed in 1795, so that the tradition at least predated the relocation of Whittington College to Highgate.", "The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington by \"T.
