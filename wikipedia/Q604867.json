Brighton started on the offence with Barham and Walker exploiting the wings while Small worked to disrupt the Notts County defence.  They dominated the first 20 minutes but after Walker's shot was blocked, Notts County began to get a foothold in the match.  In the 29th minute, Notts County won a controversial corner: Chivers tackled Dean Thomas and the ball appeared to have gone out off the Notts County player, but Elleray awarded the corner against Brighton. A short pass from the set play from Turner found Thomas.  He played the ball back to Turner whose cross was met by Johnson who scored past Digweed in the Brighton goal.  Just before half-time, Walker passed to Gary Chivers who returned the pass: Chivers jumped to head the ball goal-bound but it rebounded off the near post.", "|DF||||Gary Chivers || "]}, {"page": "Chivers, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Chivers"]}]}}
