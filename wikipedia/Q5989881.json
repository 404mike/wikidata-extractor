Clothier expressed himself to be happy with the Office that he inherited from Sir Idwal Pugh: coming  to my task without previous close experience with the work of either Parliament or the Executive, I have been much impressed by both.  Clothier did not seek to alter the Office, but to develop it along the lines laid out by his predecessors.  After a drop in the number of complaints received, the Office handled 1,031 in 1980, the fourth highest since the Office opened in 1967.  Clothier continued the practice of arousing public awareness of the Office, eagerly accepting invitations to talk to groups in different parts of the country and determined that people should regard the Ombudsman as fundamental feature of the constitution.  The last thing an Ombudsman wants to be observed Clothier, is distant, cold and inaccessible.  Yet it was also important not to incite [the public] to grumble about nothing in particular.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), pp232-7 In the first statutory extension of the Ombudsman's remit since 1967, the Office was permitted to investigate the actions of consular staff abroad in their duties towards United Kingdom citizens.  Clothier also considered that in instances where it was questionable whether an investigation should be undertaken or not, that he would lean in favour of the complainant.  Even so, if the complainant was unable to produce prima facie evidence of maladministration, Clothier was bound to reject the complaint."]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sir Idwal Pugh, civil servant (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2010", "response": ["*Sir Idwal Pugh, 92, British civil servant, Permanent Secretary to the Welsh Office and Health Service Commissioner."]}, {"page": "William Reid (civil servant)", "response": ["In 1990, Reid was the first civil servant to be appointed to the post of Ombudsman since Sir Idwal Pugh.  He came to the Office when it was flushed with the success of the Barlow Clowes investigation, which crowned an otherwise quiet decade in which fewer MPs were referring cases.  Reid oversaw a dramatic upswing in caseload during his tenure - from 704 complaints in 1990 to 1,920 in 1996, the largest annual total in the history of the Office.  Yet the Office did not keep up with this growth, and the number of outstanding cases grew considerably.  The remit of the Ombudsman extended appreciably, to incorporate administrative actions of persons appointed by the Lord Chancellor as a member of court administrative staff.  The Office also had numerous tribunals brought within its jurisdiction, as well as bodies such as the National Lottery, the Coal Authority, The Environment Agency and the Rail Regulator.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), pp286-290"]}, {"page": "Idwal Vaughan Pugh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Idwal Pugh"]}]}}
