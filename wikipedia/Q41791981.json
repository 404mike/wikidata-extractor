In 1958 he was appointed Children's Physician several days before the start of the National Health Service. It was Guys where MacKeith's enduring notability was established, when he persuaded the hospital to permit parental visiting every day, instead of the usual habit of twice per week. This became established practice in the United Kingdom and abroad. He established the first cerebral palsy advice clinic, which was to become in 1964, the larger and more comprehensive Newcomen Centre for handicapped children in Guy's Hospital, becoming its first director, and later being joined by Mary Sheridan. The unit was established is a disused Victorian pub, located just outside the back gate. Access was by a steep winding stair, in which disabled children were carried, or occasionally climbed with dogged determination, which never curbed the enthusiasm of the staff. The centre eventually became too small and moved into Portakabins at the foot of Guys Tower. MacKeith, or Ronnie to his staff, remained there until he retired in 1974."]}]}}
