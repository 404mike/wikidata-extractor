Produced by Alison Stewart, the format of the programme was that viewers would submit questions and queries (usually general knowledge, but sometimes metaphysical or scientific), and the two hosts, Tracy BrabinBFI (later Sophie Aldred and then Diane-Louise Jordan) and Simon Davies, would try to answer the questions, aided by an anthopomorphised animal puppet, Jo Corner, who was performed and puppeteered by Robin Stevens (who later performed as Tom on Ragdoll's Tots TV). Being children's programming, the explanations used humour to convey information and frequently involved demonstrations which degenerated into slapstick humour.  Songs were also used.  A show with a similar format, \"Dear Mr. Barker\", aired on CBBC in the mid-1990s, but did not last long."]}, {"page": "Run the Risk", "response": ["* First Episode: Diane-Louise Jordan, Tim Vincent, Clare Buckfield, John Pickard (British actor), Dean Gatiss and Justin Pickett"]}, {"page": "Diane louise jordan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Diane-Louise Jordan"]}, {"page": "Brian D'Arcy", "response": ["On 15 April 2007, D'Arcy replaced Canon Roger Royle on the long-standing BBC Radio 2 show Sunday Half Hour.
