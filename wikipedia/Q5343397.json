He was educated at Harrow School, where he played for the cricket eleven against Eton College. After completing his education at Harrow, Acheson decided on a career in the British Army, purchasing the commissions of ensign and lieutenant in May 1865. The following year he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Hampshire at Lord's. He batted just once in the match, being dismissed without scoring by Edward Hemsted. He was described by Wisden as \"a good hitter, but wanting in defence; fielded well at long-leg and cover-point, his throwing-in being particularly good; rather wild as a bowler, but at times destructive\".
