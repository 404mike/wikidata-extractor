John Newton and Joseph Milner were influential evangelical clerics. Evangelical clergy networked together through societies such as the Eclectic Society in London and the Elland Society in Yorkshire. The Old Dissenter denominations (the Baptists, Congregationalists and Quakers) were falling under evangelical influence, with the Baptists most affected and Quakers the least. Evangelical ministers dissatisfied with both Anglicanism and Methodism often chose to work within these churches. In the 1790s, all of these evangelical groups, including the Anglicans, were Calvinist in orientation."]}, {"page": "William Wilberforce", "response": ["Wilberforce was a small, sickly and delicate child with poor eyesight. In 1767, he began attending Hull Grammar School, which at the time was headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, Joseph Milner, who was to become a lifelong friend. Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school, until his father's death in 1768 caused changes in his living arrangements. With his mother struggling to cope, the nine-year-old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James' Place, London, and Wimbledon, at that time a village  south-west of London. He attended an \"indifferent\" boarding school in Putney for two years. He spent his holidays in Wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives. He became interested in evangelical Christianity due to his relatives' influence, especially that of his aunt Hannah, sister of the wealthy Christian merchant John Thornton, a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading Methodist preacher George Whitefield."]}, {"page": "John Henry Newman", "response": ["At the age of 15, during his last year at school, Newman converted to Evangelical Christianity, an incident of which he wrote in his Apologia that it was \"more certain than that I have hands or feet\". Almost at the same time (March 1816) the bank Ramsbottom, Newman and Co. crashed, though it paid its creditors and his father left to manage a brewery.Gilley, pp. 13\u201314. Mayers, who had himself undergone a conversion in 1814, lent Newman books from the English Calvinist tradition. \"It was in the autumn of 1816 that Newman fell under the influence of a definite creed and received into his intellect impressions of dogma never afterwards effaced.\" He became an evangelical Calvinist and held the typical belief that the Pope was the antichrist under the influence of the writings of Thomas Newton,Gilley, p. 19. as well as his reading of Joseph Milner's History of the Church of Christ. Mayers is described as a moderate, Clapham Sect Calvinist,Gilley, p. 21. and Newman read William Law as well as William Beveridge in devotional literature.Gilley, p. 22. He also read The Force of Truth by Thomas Scott.\"Benedict XVI's Message to Newman Conference\", ZENIT, 22 November 2010."]}, {"page": "George Stanley Faber", "response": ["His books on the primitive doctrines of election and justification retain some importance. He laid stress on the evangelical view of these doctrines in opposition to the opinion of contemporary writers of very different schools, such as Vicesimus Knox and Joseph Milner. His works show some research and careful writing. He died at Sherburn Hospital, near Durham, 27 January 1854, and was buried in the chapel of the hospital on 1 February.

In his early twenties his reputation as a lay preacher drew the attention of the evangelical Elland Society, which sought to train poor men for the ministry of the Church of England. With a scholarship from the Elland Society Marsden attended Hull Grammar School, where he became associated with Joseph Milner and the reformist William Wilberforce, and after two years, he matriculated, at the age of 25, at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He abandoned his degree studies to respond to the call of the evangelical leader Charles Simeon for service in overseas missions. Marsden was offered the position of second chaplain to the Reverend Richard Johnson's ministry to the Colony of New South Wales on 1 January 1793."]}, {"page": "Moorgate tube crash", "response": ["Work on removing the bodies and clearing the wreckage from the tunnel began after the last casualty had been removed. With no casualties remaining, the Fire Brigade were able to use flame cutting equipment. After the third carriage was cut free from the second, at 1:00\u00a0am on 1 March the third carriage began to be winched back down the track; as it began moving a body that no-one had seen fell from the wreckage and onto the track. According to Joseph Milner, the chief fire officer of the London Fire Brigade, the body gave \"the first indication of how protracted would be the work ahead\". Once the carriage had been removed, a doctor again checked for further signs of living casualties; none were found."]}, {"page": "Richard Johnson (chaplain)", "response": ["Johnson was the son of John and Mary Johnson.

The magazine after Rose's death became more and more literary and historical in its tone. Maitland had incurred the dislike of the Evangelical party by attacks on their leaders, and merciless criticism of Joseph Milner, John Foxe, and others. He had also become an object of suspicion to the Tractarians, by his Letter to a Friend on Tract No. 89, which he issued in 1841 (republished in Eight Essays, 1852).", "In 1826 Maitland put forth a pamphlet which he called An Enquiry into the Grounds on which the Prophetic Period of Daniel and St. John has been supposed to consist of 1260 Years. This work argued against the Irvingite reading of the theory of Joachim of Fiore. The pamphlet attracted a controversy which continued for some years. One of the side issues in the controversy turned on the question of the Catholic orthodoxy, or alleged Protestantism, of the Albigenses and the Waldenses; Joseph Milner, in his Church History, had claimed them as among the \"Heavenly Witnesses\" during the Middle Ages. Maitland in 1832 published, in a volume of 546 pages, his most elaborate work entitled Facts and Documents illustrative of the History, Doctrine, and Rites of the ancient Albigenses and Waldenses. Maitland allowed himself to speak with something like contempt of Milner's Church History, and was attacked in print."]}, {"page": "William Ludlam", "response": ["He was also the author of Four Theological Essays on the Scripture Metaphors and other Subjects, 1787, and Two Essays on Justification and the Influence of the Holy Spirit, 1788.

Another source states that during his time in Carlisle he \"passed a great portion of his life\" studying Hebrew, becoming deeply familiar with rabbinical scholarship which, he believed, was sometimes better able than Christian sources to \"catch the rays of light\" emanating from the Bible. He was also a prodigious letter writer, engaging in scholarly exchanges with contemporary theologians including Isaac Milner, the eccentric and endlessly curious Dean of Carlisle and his brother, the church historian Joseph Milner. Other correspondents included Archdeacon William Paley, Archdeacon Robert Markham, Archdeacon Robert Nares, Bishop Beilby Porteus and Bishop Samuel Horsley. The scholarly content of Bennet's letters must have been substantive, since the analyses and critiques that he expressed found their way across the Atlantic, and in 1802 George Bennet was the recipient of an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Harvard College in Massachusetts."]}, {"page": "Peter William Watson", "response": ["He was born at Kingston upon Hull in 1761, and baptised at Holy Trinity Church there on 26 August.
