In 1924 he started the Polyposis Registry with Cuthbert Dukes which kept data on people with inherited multiple polyps. In 1925 his systematic study of people and their families demonstrated a genetic explanation for the association between people with multiple bowel polyps and bowel cancer, 20 years after polyposis was first suggested to be a familial condition by William Harrison Cripps from St Bartholomew's Hospital. Lockhart-Mummery was a co-founder and key figure in the 1923 British Empire Cancer Campaign, in which he remained active for the rest of his life and which slanted more clinically than the rival scientific Imperial Cancer Research Fund, who had their own significant figures including Walter Morley Fletcher and Frederick Gowland Hopkins."]}]}}
