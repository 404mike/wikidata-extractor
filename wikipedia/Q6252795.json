Investment by new director Peter Wetzel allowed Bremner to spend \u00a3120,000 on three players in March: \u00a360,000 on Stirling Albion defender John Philliben, \u00a325,000 on young Celtic midfielder Jim Dobbin, and \u00a335,000 on Shrewsbury Town defender Alan Brown.

Meanwhile, stalwart goalkeeper Gordon Arthur departed for Dumbarton.

Dobbin spent two-and-a-half years at Belle Vue before moving to Barnsley in 1986. Spending five years at Oakwell, Dobbin featured in over 100 league matches for The Tykes, before beginning the first of two spells with Grimsby Town in 1991. Dobbin's \u00a3200,000 move saw him go on to make over 150 league appearances for Grimsby before his release at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. From here, Dobbin spent a year with Rotherham United, appearing in around half of the club's matches before re-joining Doncaster for the 1997\u201398 season. A regular during this season, Doncaster were struggling at the bottom and released Dobbin before the end of the season, allowing him to join Scarborough. After just one match, Dobbin returned to Grimsby, featuring twice in the remainder of the season. He played another four matches at the start of the following season before being loaned to Southport for the latter part. In 1999-00, Dobbin spent time with three part-time clubs, turning out for Gainsborough Trinity, Boston United and Whitby Town before retiring at the end of the season."]}]}}
