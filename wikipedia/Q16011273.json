Richard Doll had joined the Social Medicine Unit at Central Middlesex Hospital in 1948 to work with Francis Avery-Jones on peptic ulcer disease, but by 1950 he was working with Austin Bradford Hill at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on the possible link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Joules had been a heavy smoker for 30 years but after seeing Doll and Hill's results he became entirely convinced of the harmful effects of smoking. His father had died of lung cancer and he immediately stopped smoking himself and became a strident voice in the campaign against tobacco. Since Joules was a member of the CHSC, SAC(CR) and SMAC he was ideally placed to press the issue with the Ministry of Health. Still, he was often a lone voice speaking against tobacco and was opposed by many inside and outside of government. In 1952 an anonymous civil servant in the Ministry of Health wrote that:[Joules] \u2018is as you know the main protagonist against smoking - on the CHSC, on the SAC(CR) and in the Press.\u2019 Nevertheless, despite opposition from Sir Ernest Rock Carling, chair of the SAC(CR), he persuaded the Central Health Services Council to make the first official statement in Britain on the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. It is likely his contacts with the Labour Minister for Health, Hilary Marquand, and the recent death in February 1952 of King George VI, a heavy smoker, from a heart attack after an operation for lung cancer helped his case. Joules also energetically lobbied the Press, the Chief Medical Officer, and the Royal College of Physicians.  In 1953 Joules was quoted in Parliament by the Labour MP, Harry Hynd as saying that: 'by 1965...unless something is done [about smoking], the number of deaths per annum [from lung cancer] will reach 25,000.'In 1954 Joules' appointment to SAC(CR) was not renewed - he had rocked the boat too much and his political views were unpalatable to the Conservative government that had been elected in 1951. His dismissal, along with those of Somerville Hastings, and David Stark Murray resulted in trade union protests, but these had no effect. Joules was replaced by Janet Aitken, who admitted to the Health Minister that: \u2018I am not really an expert from a medical point of view in cancer and radiotherapy.\u2019 Nevertheless, although Joules had been dropped from SAC(CR), he was still a member of the SMAC and he persuaded it to advise the Minister that it was \u2018desirable that appropriate action should be taken constantly to inform the public of the known connection between smoking and cancer of the lung and of the risks involved in heavy smoking\u2019.  This was blocked by the CHSC in October 1955 who considered it would be \u2018wise\u2019 to await the outcome of further research, including that financed by the tobacco companies. Nevertheless, the tide of opinion was turning and in March 1956 the CHSC yielded to a further recommendation from the SMAC and advised that:"]}]}}
