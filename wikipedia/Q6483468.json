Frederick Mallalieu's father, Henry (1831\u20131902), was a self-made businessman, at the age of twelve a hand-loom weaver, but becoming a woolen manufacturer, chairman of ironworks companies, and the magistrate.Lancelot Mallalieu was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford., Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Oxford.At the 1931 general election, Mallalieu was elected as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley. His win was notable as it was a gain from Labour despite the presence of a Conservative candidate, unusual for 1931. His predecessor was the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, who had decided to stand down. His father Frederick Mallalieu had been MP for the same seat from 1916 to 1922.Mallalieu was a member of the main Liberal group in parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel. He followed his leader into opposition in 1933. He served until the 1935 general election, when he lost his seat to Labour's Ernest Marklew.After joining the Labour Party, he returned to the House of Commons in 1948, at a by-election on 24 March in the Brigg constituency, where he served as MP until he retired in 1974. He was a Deputy Speaker of the Commons from 1971 to 1974.", "link_mentions": {}}}
