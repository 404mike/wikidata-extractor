The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 1989 Historian E. A.

Oxford, Clarendon Press,  1876. (pp. 825-6). Freeman also cited the late twelfth-century book Dialogus de Scaccario by Richard FitzNeal. This book claimed that the Saxons and Normans had so merged through intermarriage and cultural assimilation that (outside the aristocracy) it was impossible to tell \"one from the other.\" Finally, Freeman ended his critique of Scott by saying that by the end of the twelfth century, the descendants of both Saxons and Normans in England referred to themselves as \"English\", not \"Saxon\" or \"Norman\"."]}, {"page": "1198", "response": ["* September 10 \u2013 Richard FitzNeal, bishop of London (b. 1130)"]}, {"page": "1159", "response": ["* (Approximate date): Churchman Richard FitzNeal is appointed Lord High Treasurer in England, in charge of Henry II of England's Exchequer, an office he will hold for almost 40 years."]}, {"page": "1177", "response": ["* possible date \u2013 Richard FitzNeal begins to write his treatise Dialogus de Scaccario (\"Dialogue concerning the Exchequer\") in England."]}, {"page": "Domesday Book", "response": ["The assessors' reckoning of a man's holdings and their values, as recorded in Domesday Book, was dispositive and without appeal.
