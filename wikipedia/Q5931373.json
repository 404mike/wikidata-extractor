His regular position was as a forward.  He played for Westerlea, Ayr, and Manchester United. Kerr joined Ayr from Westerlea in 1903, but only spent half a season there before joining Manchester United in January 1904. However, the Ayr officials were of the opinion that United had made an illegal, unofficial approach to sign Kerr, and an enquiry into the transfer was set up by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). Kerr made his Manchester United debut in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Blackpool on 9 March 1904, followed by another appearance in a 2\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 26 March. The IFAB found United innocent of any illicit contact with Kerr about a week later, but he was ultimately released at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": {}}}
