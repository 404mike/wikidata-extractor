The British acted in coordination with the French, who were also drawn into the Second Opium War over the death of Auguste Chapdelaine, a French missionary in China. Parkes, who was attached to Admiral Seymour's staff, was part of the group of Anglo-French representatives who delivered an ultimatum to the Qing officials on 12 December. When the ultimatum expired, the British and French bombarded Canton on 28 December and conquered the city by late December. Parkes hunted Ye Mingchen through the streets of Canton; George Wingrove Cooke reported that Parkes took special pleasure in humiliating Ye. \"Ye was my game,\" said Parkes, and finally found what a report called \"a very fat man contemplating the achievement of getting over the wall at the extreme rear\" of the administrative office."]}, {"page": "War correspondent", "response": ["* George Wingrove Cooke, Second Opium War, 1857\u20131858."]}, {"page": "Eli Boggs", "response": ["Eli Boggs (fl. mid 19th century) was an American pirate, one of the last active ocean-going pirates operating off the coast of China during the 1850s. Based near Hong Kong, Boggs constantly raided outgoing clipper ships carrying highly valuable cargo of opium throughout the decade. He is most particularly known for his cruelty, as in one recorded incident he had the body of a captured Chinese merchant cut into small pieces and had them delivered to shore in small buckets as a warning against interference in his criminal activities. In 1857, after a violent and bloody siege, Boggs was forced to swim ashore after his junk was destroyed by rival pirates. However, after holding his captors at bay with a knife, Boggs was finally apprehended and imprisoned in a Hong Kong jail for three years, eventually being tried for murder before his deportation to the United States in 1857. The closing statement he made at his trial resounded with George Wingrove Cooke and triggered an investigation into one of Hong Kong's earliest political scandals: the collaboration between government's Daniel Caldwell and pirate Ma Chow Wong."]}, {"page": "George Cooke", "response": ["* George Wingrove Cooke (1814\u20131865), British lawyer and historian"]}, {"page": "Hugh Chamberlen", "response": ["Chamberlen's politics were those of the Whigs.

Mann, and Lieutenants William Stuart, Alexander Dirom and William Trench. On 11 October, Lugard expressed concern to General Thomas Ashburnham commanding the force, that the engineers' duties in the field were destroyed without a sufficient force of trained sappers. With many factors contributing to the impossibility of organising efficient substitutes, he urged that 23rd Company be shipped to Hong Kong at the earliest opportunity. Lieutenant Stuart took charge of a body of volunteer sappers, which he trained to a valuable capability. The 23rd Company carried on in India where they took part in recapturing Lucknow."]}]}}
