The daughter of a radical Member of Parliament, Clark was a prominent speaker for women's voting rights and at times a political realist who served as a mainstay of the 19th century suffrage movement in South West England. A liberal in all senses, Clark aided progress toward universal human brotherhood through her activities in organisations which assisted former slaves and aboriginal peoples.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1800\u20131874||data-sort-value=\"Clark, Helen Bright\"|Helen Bright Clark||United Kingdom||1840||1972||Suffragette||"]}, {"page": "Helen Clark (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Helen Bright Clark (1840\u20131927), British feminist"]}, {"page": "C. & J.
