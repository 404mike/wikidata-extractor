Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis, but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son Kyle) to Nashville, Tennessee, where he is supposed to record a song. Only Time gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy.Schickel, p. 383 Nevertheless, the film received a more positive reception in France, where it was compared to John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath,Schickel, p. 384 and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Around the same time, Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the Cold War-themed Firefox (also 1982). Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas, the film was shot before but released after Honkytonk Man. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20\u00a0million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to that time.Schickel, p. 378 People magazine likened Eastwood's performance to \"Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul\"."]}, {"page": "Wolfsbane", "response": ["*Wolfsbane, a 1978 novel by Craig Thomas"]}, {"page": "Sausalito, California", "response": ["*Craig Thomas set the home of Alan Aubrey in Sausalito in his 1990 thriller The Last Raven."]}, {"page": "Techno-thriller", "response": ["One of the earliest techno-thrillers is thought to be The Satan Bug (1962) by Alistair MacLean, while a lot of what counted for science fiction in the pre-war and early post-war Soviet Union were essentially techno-thrillers, full of technical details and featuring complex spy-rich plots, one of the most enduring example being the Grigory Adamov's The Mystery of the Two Oceans (1939).
