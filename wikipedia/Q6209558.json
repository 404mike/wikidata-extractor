McConnell had a remarkable record at international level. His first game, played at left-back against Wales in 1912, resulted in a 3\u20132 win. The following year, installed in his favoured right-back role, he played in a 2\u20131 victory over England at Windsor Park \u2013 Ireland\u2019s first success against their largest neighbours. During the 1\u20131 draw against Scotland in the game to secure the championship, McConnell suffered an injury was forced to go into goal for Ireland after Fred McKee was also hurt and had to leave the field. Wearing a sodden goalkeeper's jersey two sizes too small, McConnell was at fault for the Scottish goal which looked to have robbed Ireland of victory as he rushed off his line only to be beaten by forward Joe Donnachie; however Linfield player Samuel Young managed to score the equalising goal."]}]}}
