She made important contributions to the understanding of childhood nutrition and preventive healthcare. Mackay was the first woman fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.\nAfter graduation from the London School of Medicine for Women (now part of the UCL Medical School), Mackay practiced at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children where she was the first female physician to work there, and also one of the first women to be appointed as a consultant there. Helen Mackay was the first person to investigate anaemia in infants and to attribute iron deficiency as an important factor of this. This led to changes in childhood nutrition favouring breastfeeding over formula feeding in the United Kingdom.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cheltenham Ladies' College", "response": ["*Helen Mackay, first female Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians"]}, {"page": "London School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["* Helen Mackay, the first female fellow of the Royal College of Physicians"]}, {"page": "Ahmed Ramzy", "response": ["Ramzy was born Ramzi Mahmud Bayyumi in 1930 to Dr Mahmud Bayumi, an Egyptian orthopedist and university professor father,  and Helen Mackay, a young Scottish lady."]}, {"page": "Catherine Neill", "response": ["Neill began her medical career as a pediatric registrar at London's Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, where she worked alongside Helen Mackay and developed an interest in congenital heart defects, frequently going out of her way to admit patients with polycythemia, a disease state in which the hematocrit (the volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood) is elevated."]}, {"page": "Helen Marion Macpherson Mackay", "response": ["#redirect Helen Mackay"]}, {"page": "Melville Mackenzie", "response": ["After convalescence he visited Germany in 1924 with a paediatrician Helen Mackay, to investigate the health of German schoolchildren.
