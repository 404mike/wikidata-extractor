David Baldwin also hated white people and \"his devotion to God was mixed with a hope that God would take revenge on them for him\", wrote another Baldwin biographer James Campbell. During the 1920s and 1930s, David worked at a soft-drinks bottling factory, though he was eventually laid off from this job, and, as his anger entered his sermons, he became less in demand as a preacher. David Baldwin sometimes took out his anger on his family, and the children became fearful of him, tensions to some degree balanced by the love lavished on them by their mother. David Baldwin grew paranoid near the end of his life. He was committed to a mental asylum in 1943 and died of tuberculosis on July 29 of that year, the same day Emma gave birth to their last child, Paula. James Baldwin, at his mother's urging, had visited his dying stepfather the day before, and came to something of a posthumous reconciliation with him in his essay, \"Notes of a Native Son\", in which he wrote, \"in his outrageously demanding and protective way, he loved his children, who were black like him and menaced like him\". David Baldwin's funeral was held on James's 19th birthday, around the same time that the Harlem riot broke out.", "Baldwin spent nine years living in Paris, mostly in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, with various excursions to Switzerland, Spain, and back to the United States.;  Baldwin's time in Paris was itinerant: he stayed with various friends around the city and in various hotels. Most notable of these lodgings was H\u00f4tel Verneuil, a hotel in Saint-Germain that had collected a motley crew of struggling expatriates, mostly writers. This Verneuil circle spawned numerous friendships that Baldwin relied upon in rough periods. Baldwin was also continuously poor during his time in Paris, with only momentary respites from that condition. In his early years in Saint-Germain, Baldwin acquainted himself with Otto Friedrich, Mason Hoffenberg, Asa Benveniste, Themistocles Hoetis, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Max Ernst, Truman Capote, and Stephen Spender, among many others.;  Baldwin also met Lucian Happersberger, a Swiss boy, seventeen years old at the time of their first meeting, who came to France in search of excitement. Happersberger became Baldwin's lover, especially in Baldwin's first two years in France, and Baldwin's near-obsession for some time after. Baldwin and Happersberger would remain friends for the next thirty-nine years. Though his time in Paris was not easy, Baldwin did escape the aspects of American life that most terrified him\u2014especially the \"daily indignities of racism\", per biographer James Campbell. According to Baldwin's friend and biographer David Leeming: \"Baldwin seemed at ease in his Paris life; Jimmy Baldwin the aesthete and lover reveled in the Saint-Germain ambiance.\"", "Shortly after returning to Paris, Baldwin got word from Dial Press that Giovanni's Room had been accepted for publication. Baldwin sent the final manuscript for the book to his editor, James Silberman, on April 8, 1956, and the book was published that autumn.;  In the novel, the protagonist David is in Paris while his fianc\u00e9 Hella is in Spain. David meets the titular Giovanni at the bar that Giovanni owns; the two grow increasingly intimate and David eventually finds his way to Giovanni's room. David is confused by his intense feelings for Giovanni and has sex with a woman in the spur of the moment to reaffirm his sexuality. Meanwhile, Giovanni begins to prostitute himself and finally commits a murder for which he is guillotined. David's tale is one of love's inhibition: he cannot \"face love when he finds it\", writes biographer James Campbell. The novel features a traditional theme: the clash between the restraints of puritanism and the impulse for adventure, emphasizing the loss of innocence that results. The inspiration for the murder part of the novel's plot is an event dating from 1943 to 1944. A Columbia University undergraduate named Lucien Carr murdered an older, homosexual man, David Kammerer, who made sexual advances on Carr. The two were walking near the banks of the Hudson River when Kammerrer made a pass at Carr, leading Carr to stab Kammerer and dump Kammerer's body in the river. To Baldwin's relief, the reviews of Giovanni's Room were positive, and his family did not criticize the subject matter."]}, {"page": "Art Spiegelman", "response": ["Maus looms large not only over Spiegelman's body of work, but over the comics medium itself. While Spiegelman was far from the first to do autobiography in comics, critics such as James Campbell considered Maus the work that popularized it. The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia\u2014the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics. It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints, though most often by those with little understanding of Maus context in the history of comics. While Maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of high art in the public imagination, criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture, roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote."]}, {"page": "James Campbell", "response": ["James Campbell may refer to:", "* James Campbell (historian) (1935\u20132016), British academic specialising in Anglo-Saxon studies", "* James Campbell (industrialist) (1826\u20131900), Hawaii industrialist", "* James Campbell (Australian timber merchant) (1830\u20131904), Australian timber merchant", "* James Campbell (artist) (1828\u20131893), English artist ", "* Blind James Campbell (1906\u20131981), American blues singer and guitarist", "* James Campbell (clarinetist) (born 1949), Canadian/American clarinetist", "* James Campbell (author) (born 1951), Scottish writer", "* James Campbell (comedian), children's comedian in the UK", "* James Campbell (actor), English actor in Oh No It Isn't!", "* James Campbell, 1st Earl of Irvine, Lord Kintyre (1610\u20131645), colonel of the Garde \u00c9cossaise and son of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll", "* James Campbell (officer of arms), Lord Lyon King of Arms, 1658\u20131660", "* James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1745) (c. 1680\u20131745), Scottish officer of the British Army", "* James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1831) (1745\u20131831), British Army officer", "* James Campbell (land commissioner) (1787\u20131858), British Army officer and Commissioner of Crown Lands in Canterbury, New Zealand", "* James Campbell (Royal Marines officer) (1761\u20131840)", "* Sir James Campbell, 1st Baronet (1763\u20131819), British Army officer", "* James Campbell (New South Wales politician) (1820\u20131879), Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly 1864\u20131874 for Morpeth", "* James Campbell (Queensland politician) (1838\u20131925), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* James Campbell (Victorian politician) (1845\u20131893), Member of the Victorian Legislative Council (Wellington) 1882\u20131886, Assembly 1982\u201393", "* James Campbell (of Burnbank and Boquhan) (c. 1660\u2013c. 1713), MP for Ayr Burghs", "* Sir James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Ardkinglass (1666\u20131752), British MP for Argyllshire and Stirlingshire", "* James Campbell (1737\u20131805), Scottish MP for Stirling Burghs", "* James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy (1851\u20131931), Irish Solicitor-General, Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor", "* James Campbell (governor) (c. 1773\u20131835), of British Ceylon, 1822\u20131824", "* James Campbell (postmaster general) (1812\u20131893), US postmaster general", "* James Campbell (Wisconsin politician) (1814\u20131883), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "* James Campbell (English cricketer) (born 1988), English cricketer", "* James Campbell (English footballer) (fl. 1910/11), English goalkeeper (Huddersfield Town)", "* James Campbell (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u20131938), Scottish footballer (Kilmarnock FC and Scotland)", "* James Campbell (javelin thrower) (born 1988), Scottish javelin thrower", "* James Campbell (New Zealand cricketer) (fl. 1868/69), New Zealand cricketer", "* James Campbell (rugby union) (1858\u20131902), Canadian rugby player", "* James Campbell (pole vaulter) (1901\u20131975), British Olympic athlete", "* James Campbell (journalist) (fl. 2000s), Australian journalist", "* James Campbell, 2nd Baronet, of Aberuchil, see Campbell baronets", "* James Campbell, pseudonym of James Campbell Reddie (died 1878), author of pornography", "* James Campbell (potter) (1943\u20132019), British potter", "* James Campbell High School"]}, {"page": "History of modern Western subcultures", "response": ["*This is the Beat Generation by James Campbell"]}, {"page": "My Life and Loves", "response": ["In the early 1950s, Harris's widow Nellie sold about a hundred pages of his writings on further autobiographical matters to Kahane's son Maurice Girodias for a million French francs.
