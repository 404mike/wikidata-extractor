With his sister, Ann Gloag, he founded the Stagecoach Group of bus and rail operators. He also founded the bus and coach operator Megabus, the train operating company South West Trains, his investments company Souter Holdings Ltd, and the Souter Charitable Trust.\nSouter has been politically active in Scotland, and supported the Scottish National Party financially. In 2000, when the Scottish Executive proposed to repeal Section 2A of the Local Government Act, which prevented local authorities from \"promoting homosexuality\", Souter started the Keep the Clause campaign to oppose their plans, spending \u00a31 million of his own money to organise a private referendum across Scotland. This campaign and other controversial statements have led opponents to accuse him of homophobia.\nIn 2011, he was knighted for services to transport and the voluntary sector. The honour was criticised by Scottish Labour Party politicians and by gay rights campaigners.\nIn October 2019, Souter made what is possibly the biggest charitable donation from a Scot since Andrew Carnegie gave away his fortune. His donation of \u00a3109 million came on top of \u00a398M he had already gifted to the Souter Charitable Trust which has supported 13,000 causes over 13 years.According to the Sunday Times Rich List in 2020, Souter and his sister Ann Gloag are worth \u00a3730 million, a decrease of \u00a3145 million from the previous year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dundee", "response": ["Abertay University was founded as Dundee Institute of Technology in 1888.
