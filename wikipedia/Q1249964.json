From about 1858, Fairbrother took the name Mrs FitzGeorge. The marriage was non-existent, not a morganatic marriage as many have called it.e.g. Compton Mackenzie, The Windsor tapestry (1938) page 344; Michael Thornton, Royal Feud (1985) pp. 161\u2013162, and many other authorities.

Sarah Fairbrother (whose stage name was Louisa) had been an actress since 1827, performing at Drury Lane, the Lyceum, and Covent Garden Theatre. As the marriage was contrary to the Royal Marriages Act, the Duke's wife was not titled Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style Her Royal Highness, nor was their son born after the marriage eligible to succeed to the Duke's titles. Indeed, Sarah's very existence was ignored by the Queen. Instead, Sarah called herself \"Mrs. Fairbrother\" and later \"Mrs. FitzGeorge\". The Duke was a very weak man where women were concerned, and it seems likely that he had been cajoled into marriage by Sarah (then pregnant for the fifth time), she herself obtaining the licence. Legend has created for the couple an ideal relationship that is far from the reality; the Duke having other affairs.Anthony J.

As early as 1849 he had decided that he would be buried near Beauclerk and it was solely on her account that Sarah Fairbrother and he were deposited in the mausoleum in Kensal Green Cemetery, west of the main chapel, about sixty feet away from Beauclerk's grave.Camp, op.cit., p. 339.", "The Duke of Cambridge and Mrs. FitzGeorge had three sons, two of whom were born before their marriage in contravention to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, Ironically the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 would have made George and Sarah Fairbrother marriage legal as Royal consent  is now limited to only the first six persons in succession in line to the British throne; George was eighth in line to succession"]}, {"page": "Adolphus FitzGeorge", "response": ["Adolphus FitzGeorge was born 30 January 1846, the second son of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge and the actress Sarah Fairbrother.
