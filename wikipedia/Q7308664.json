In 1947, he was promoted to the rank of Captain. Having been a talented sportsman before the war, Gay featured in first-class cricket, being selected in 1949 to play for the Combined Services against the touring New Zealanders at the Garrison Ground 2. Gay was dismissed for a duck in the Combined Services first-innings by Ces Burke, while in the New Zealanders first-innings he bowled 31 overs of his right-arm medium pace, though without taking a wicket. He made a second first-class appearance for the Combined Services in the same season against Hampshire at the United Services Recreation Ground, Portsmouth.  He again made a duck in the Combined Services first-innings, falling to the bowling of Clifford Walker.  He claimed two wickets in Hampshire's first-innings, those of David Blake and Reginald Dare, finishing the innings with figures of 2/61 from 23 overs, while in their second-innings he took figures of 4/57 from 15 overs. In that same season, he played two first-class matches for Sussex in the County Championship against Glamorgan at The Saffrons, Eastbourne, and Surrey at the County Ground, Hove. This was his only season of first-class cricket, though he did feature for the Free Foresters in non-first-class matches in 1951 and 1952."]}, {"page": "Dare (name)", "response": ["*Reginald Dare (1921\u20131993), English cricketer and footballer"]}]}}
