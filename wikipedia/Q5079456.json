He was educated at Queens College Galway, and passed the Indian Civil Service Examinations in 1870. He served in Bengal and dealt with the famine of 1874. His duties also included tenant rights and judicial control of rents.He was appointed assistant to the Director General of Statistics William Wilson Hunter in 1875 but returned to district work as a joint magistrate in 1884. He was the Superintendent of Bengal for the census of 1891, and rose to Commissioner in 1898 before his retirement in 1900.O'Donnell had a palpable dislike of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India, addressing \"The Failure of Lord Curzon\" to Lord Rosebery. Elected as a Liberal member for Walworth in the 1906 general election, O'Donnell levelled heavy criticism at the Secretary of State for India, for actions such as the partition of Bengal in 1905. He decided not to contest the January 1910 general election.He was the brother of Frank Hugh O'Donnell. He married Constance Langworth in 1882. O'Donnell died at Hans Crescent, London, in December 1934.His legacy includes the commission of the annual \"O'Donnell lectures\" on British or Celtic elements in the English language or the existing population of England, which are held at the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Swansea and Lampeter (Trinity St David).

Melville\u2019s claims, which resulted in his suspension from the College, were publicly supported by Frank Hugh O'Donnell, by then a graduate, whose brother Charles James O'Donnell was then a prominent member of the Society. Ultimately, an appeal to the queen by Melville led to an extraordinary visitation of the College to investigate the matter. Following harsh treatment of Charles James O'Donnell by the college authorities over the matter, two factions developed within the Society \u2013 a group which supported O\u2019Donnell and was sympathetic towards Melville\u2019s complaints, and a group who supported the position of the College authorities. The matter came to a head in a series of heated meetings, when a contested attempt to expel the Society\u2019s secretary, Thomas Maguire, led to the resignation of the Auditor, several members of the committee, and a member of the academic staff of the college. The final meeting in the series, on 10 March 1870, broke up in confusion, and was followed by riots along the banks of the Eglinton Canal and an early-morning duel with pistols between the main protagonists."]}, {"page": "O'Donnell lectures", "response": ["#Redirect Charles James O'Donnell"]}]}}
