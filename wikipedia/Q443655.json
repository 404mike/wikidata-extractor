He declined the Crown of Greece in 1862 after King Otto abdicated. He was created Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866. His detention of writer Rosina Bulwer Lytton, whom he had married, in an insane asylum provoked a public outcry. Bulwer-Lytton's works sold and paid him well. He coined famous phrases like \"the great unwashed\", \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\", \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", \"dweller on the threshold\", and the opening phrase \"It was a dark and stormy night.\" Yet his standing declined and he is little read today.
