Their marriage broke up, and he falsely accused her of insanity and had her detained in an insane asylum, which provoked a public outcry. He was made a baronet in the 1830s and was raised to the peerage in 1866; although she had separated from her husband she used the title Lady Lytton. She spelled her married surname without the hyphen used by her husband.", "link_mentions": {}}}
