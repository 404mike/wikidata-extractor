She was introduced to zoology by her older relative, the ornithologist and adventurer Richard Meinertzhagen, with whom she had an unusually close relationship. She became the world's expert on Mallophaga, or chewing lice; however, her work is cast into question by her suspected role in Meinertzhagen's many scientific frauds.\nDuring and immediately after World War II, she worked with Victor Rothschild at MI5.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild", "response": ["With his assistant Theresa Clay, he ran the \"Fifth Column\" operation, that saw MI5 officer Eric Roberts masquerade as the Gestapo's man in London in order to identify hundreds of Nazi sympathizers."]}, {"page": "Richard Meinertzhagen", "response": ["He later also discovered the Afghan snowfinch or Montifringilla theresae, and the Moroccan Riparia rupestris theresae and named them, and ten others, after Theresa Clay.Garfield, p. 312"]}, {"page": "New Naturalist", "response": ["The New Naturalist Library (also known as The New Naturalists) is a series of books published by Collins in the United Kingdom, on a variety of natural history topics relevant to the British Isles.

He reported that he collected the type specimen of the species in the Shibar Pass, between Bamyan and Kabul. The name he gave the species was after his cousin and companion, Theresa Clay, an expert on bird lice. While Meinertzhagen described several dozen species and subspecies (including others named after Clay), he was later found to have stolen specimens and falsified records, and this may be the only verifiably genuine taxon he described."]}, {"page": "Tess Clay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Theresa Clay"]}, {"page": "Theresa Rachel Clay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Theresa Clay"]}, {"page": "Theresa Clay Searight", "response": ["#REDIRECT Theresa Clay"]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Theresa Clay (1911\u20131995), English entomologist"]}, {"page": "Strigiphilus", "response": ["In a 1966 paper, Theresa Clay recognized 29 species and grouped them into the following nine species groups:"]}, {"page": "Colpocephalum", "response": ["Colpocephalum was circumscribed by Christian Ludwig Nitzsch in 1818.

(C.) ochraceum. The first three species were nomina nuda; only the last was accompanied with an indication to a previously-published illustration, namely a 17th-century illustration by Francesco Redi. He wrote the indication as \"Pulex avis pluvialis Redi exp. fig. sup.\" In order to keep this name valid, Theresa Clay and George Henry Evans Hopkins restricted Carl Linnaeus's 1758 name Pediculus charadrii to only the bottom figure of Redi's plate. Strictly applying the ICZN Code, the type species should have been Liotheum (Colpocephalum) ochraceum, as it was the only available name included in the original circumscription."]}, {"page": "Rallicola", "response": ["In 1953, Theresa Clay reported that Rallicola have been found on 47 species across 25 genera of Rallidae.
