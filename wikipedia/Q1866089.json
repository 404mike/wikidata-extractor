Paintings by Feather are in the public collections of the Royal Pavilion and the Walker Art Gallery. He was an expressionist painter. His early works were more formal, and in later works Feather's style became more expressive and changed as he began painting from memory. His subject matter included still lifes, populated scenes of Liverpool dance halls, and seascapes of his St Ives period.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "LGBT culture in Liverpool", "response": ["In his interview with Our Story Liverpool, a local LGBT history project, the late artist Yankel Feather recounts his experiences of cottaging in public toilets off Princes Road in the 1930s.  Due to the lack of openly gay clubs and bars at this time, many gay men visited lavatories as a means of meeting others in secret for both sex and company.  Yankel explains how life was still very difficult and how men would make the most of whatever pleasures they could get in life.  During the second World War, he goes onto describe how a 'gay identity' had not yet developed and how the word 'queer' was still being used to describe 'difference'.", "* Yankel Feather (Painter)"]}, {"page": "Homotopia (festival)", "response": ["* Girls Go Down - lesbian evening of pop, electro, retro, indie, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, My Turkish Delight By Stan Jones & Sarah Atkins-Navas, Insight Photography My World, My Story; Extraordinary Drawings by New York's Laurie Lipton, Chris Von Steiner exhibition, Memories of Yankel Feather, Project Triangle - a unique arts & social justice initiative whereby 12 young people travelled to Auschwitz and Warsaw, Truant Company presents Caretakers by Billy Cowan, Sarah Waters: In Conversation, Lau your Luppers on the Strillers Bona: The rise and fall of Polari \u2013 lecture on the secret language of gay men, Charlotte Mendelson & Joanna Briscoe, Clare Summerskill: In No Particular Order!, Lavender Girls with Rosie Wilby, Jane Townend (both Nivea Funny Women finalists) Emma Bowley and local newcomer Norma KC; UK Premiere: The Invisible Death of Michael - short film on homophobic murder of Michael Causer, Liverpool Is Burning, The Grand Vogue Ball (The Movie); Pere Faura, Striptease; Music in the afternoon with Steve McFarlane, Little Boy Written by Tommy Kearney, Directed by Steve Miller; Gay Sunday at FACT Cinema"]}]}}
