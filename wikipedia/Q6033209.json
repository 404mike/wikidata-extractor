Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"Girl on the Trapeze\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in one episode of Police Surgeon."]}, {"page": "The Two Gentlemen of Verona", "response": ["During the twentieth century, the play has been produced sporadically in the English-speaking world, although it has proved more popular in Europe. Indeed, there have been only a few significant English speaking productions. Little is known, for example, about Harley Granville-Barker's 1904 production at the Court Theatre, F.R. Benson's 1910 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Robert Atkins' 1923 production at the Apollo Theatre, or Ben Iden Payne's 1938 production at Stratford-upon-Avon. The earliest production about which we have significant information is Michael Langham's 1957 production at The Old Vic, starring Richard Gale as Valentine, Keith Michell as Proteus, Barbara Jefford as Julia and Ingrid Hafner as Silvia. In this production, set in late nineteenth-century Italy and grounded very much in high Romanticism, Proteus threatens to kill himself with a pistol at the end of the play, prompting Valentine's hasty offer of Silvia."]}, {"page": "Hafner", "response": ["*Ingrid Hafner (1936\u20131994), British actress"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Benito CarruthersGeraldine McEwanJames MaxwellCharles VictorIngrid HafnerJohn WoodnuttTom BowmanIan Fleming"]}, {"page": "Ingrid (given name)", "response": ["*Ingrid Hafner (1936\u20131994), British actress"]}, {"page": "The Lotus Eaters (TV series)", "response": ["| colspan=2                  | Ingrid Hafner"]}, {"page": "Police Surgeon (British TV series)", "response": ["When Police Surgeon was cancelled, Newman took both Hendry and co-star Ingrid Hafner to this series, and this may be why it is sometimes mistakenly claimed that The Avengers was a direct sequel to Police Surgeon, with Hendry playing the same character in both.
