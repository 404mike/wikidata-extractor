This is exemplified in illustrations in The Strand Magazine during the 1890s. With the new century, improvements in the half-tone process rendered this kind of reproductive engraving obsolete. In a less sophisticated form, it survived in advertisements and trade catalogues until about 1930. With this change, wood engraving was left free to develop as a creative form in its own right, a movement prefigured in the late 1800s by such artists as Joseph Crawhall II and the Beggarstaff Brothers."]}, {"page": "John Lavery", "response": ["John Lavery was born in inner North Belfast, baptised at St Patrick's Church, Belfast and, while still a child, moved to Scotland where he attended Haldane Academy in Glasgow in the 1870s. In 1878 he set up his own studio which was razed in a fire in the following year. With a \u00a3300 insurance pay-out he spent a year studying at Heatherley's School in London. Lavery continued his studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris in the early 1880s. He returned to Glasgow and was associated with the Glasgow School. William Burrell, a wealthy shipowner, was a faithful patron of Scottish artists including Joseph Crawhall II, with whom Lavery studied. In 1888 he was commissioned to paint the state visit of Queen Victoria to the Glasgow International Exhibition. This launched his career as a society painter and he moved to London soon after. In 1896, William Burrell commissioned Lavery to paint a portrait of his sister Mary Burrell.thumb|Portrait of Miss Mary Burrell, 1896 This portrait was exhibited widely and is considered one of Lavery's finest works.

There appears to have been relatively little collecting in the field."]}, {"page": "Northumbrian Small Pipes Society", "response": ["One significant member was the artist Joseph Crawhall II (1821\u20131896), who had a deep interest in the culture and music of Northumberland, and had published  A Beuk o' Newcassell Sangs in 1888.  He had compiled a tunebook for the use of pipers, containing tunes copied from the William Vickers manuscript, as well as tunes from oral tradition, some otherwise unknown. Parts of this are now on the FARNE archive. He corresponded with his friend and collaborator, the illustrator Charles Keene, who was also a Northumbrian piper - letters surviving from Keene to Crawhall confirm that both of them had had dealings with James Reid, the son of Robert Reid, whose business he continued. In one of these letters, Keene refers to seeing the pipes of Tommy Hair, on sale in Reid's shop in December 1873.James Reid, 1814-74: Clothing the Bare Facts, Richard Heard and Graham Wells, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol. 34, 2013-14, p.19."]}, {"page": "Rook manuscript", "response": ["Another tune, called Captain Fenwick here, Sir John Fenwick's the Flower amang them in Northumberland, and Mary Scott, the Flower of Yarrow in Scotland, appears in a 7-strain version, again with notes beyond the single octave compass of the unkeyed pipes; the same version also appears in the Antiquaries' manuscript,  as well as a manuscript of tunes compiled in 1872 by the Northumbrian artist Joseph Crawhall II, while its first 4 strains appear in the somewhat earlier Robert Bewick manuscript. It thus seems that an older single octave 4-strain version which was known to Bewick, was elaborated before 1840 by some other piper, possibly one of the Reid family,  to use the extra compass of the keyed chanter. As Robert Reid was the principal developer of the modern keyed instrument, it would have made sense for him or his children,  pipers themselves, to compose extra strains to existing pipe music exploiting the instrument's increased range. An alternative reading is that this version is older, originally to be played on Border pipes - it would require two notes above the instrument's normal range, but on some instruments, these could be played by overblowing."]}, {"page": "William Armstrong (corn merchant)", "response": ["In 1831, Armstrong, James Losh, and Donkin attended Northumberland reform meeting in support of the Great Reform Act - a wide-ranging democratic act of parliament, which had met with much opposition - and supporting a resolution against the House of Lords, who had most vigorously opposed the act. After the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reformed the governance of local boroughs, Armstrong was elected as a reformist candidate in the Newcastle town council, an office he attained with a substantial majority against the reactionary, Matthew Anderson. At the council, Armstrong voted in favour of the removal of the furniture and fittings of the Mayor's residence, and the end of the tradition of the Mayor's feasts, held at the public expense. His success didn't sustain in the following, 1839 election, where he was defeated by a landslide by the \"more formidable opponent\", George Palmer, losing his seat 38 votes to 8. With Palmer's retirement, Armstrong returned to the office in 1842, unopposed. In January 1849, upon the vacancy of a seat, he was unanimously elected an alderman of Newcastle. The aldermen were not so harmonious when, a few months later, he was proposed to be made the mayor of Newcastle, as the queen was expected to visit the town soon. The better known watercolourist, Joseph Crawhall II was selected in his stead to preside over the royal visit. By November the following year, Armstrong was elected mayor; he led a mayoralty described by local historian Richard Welford as \"quiet and uneventful\", in which Armstrong led the \"usual festivities\" and \"presided over the usual number of public meetings\"."]}]}}
