She won the 10,000 m gold medal at the 2014 European Championships in Z\u00fcrich, ten months after giving birth to her second child, to become the oldest female European champion in history at the age of 40 years and 325 days. She is coached by her husband and manager Gavin Pavey, with whom she has two children.\nPavey is a five-time Olympian, having represented Great Britain in every Olympic Games from 2000 to 2016.

She is also the 2012 European Championship silver medallist in the 10,000 m and a two-time 5000 m medallist at the Commonwealth Games, winning silver in Melbourne 2006 and bronze in Glasgow 2014.\nAt global level, her best results include bronze in the 10,000 m at the 2007 World Championships and fifth in the 5000 m at the 2004 Olympic Games. In 2015 media reports stated that 2007 silver medalist Elvan Abeylegesse had been found, on retesting, to have taken a prohibited substance, and suspended by IAAF. Confirmed in 2017, this elevated Pavey to the bronze medal, her first World Championship medal.Earlier in her career she competed in the 1500 metres, 3000 metres and 5000 metres distances. From 2007 onwards, she focused on longer distances, ranging from 5000 m to the marathon. She has personal best times of 4:01.79 (1500 m), 8:31.27 (3000 m), 14:39.96 (5000 m), 30:53.20 (10,000 m) and 2:28:24 (marathon).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2007 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|colspan=6| Dibaba fell behind the leaders halfway through the race, with obvious stomach trouble, however she managed to pull back to the front and take historic back-to-back 10,000 m titles.

Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, on the grounds that it was an unfair restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be fit for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh. She eventually proved fit enough to start the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position."]}]}}
