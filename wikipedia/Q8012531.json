Due to its size and lack of windows it was known locally as \"the meanest church in England\".  It was pulled down in about 1922, although the last service had been held several years earlier, in 1906.  One of the reasons it fell into disuse was that an iron church was built in a more populous part of the village by the late-Victorian vicar, Rev. William Stuart (brother of Robert Stuart and father of William Horwood Stuart, both diplomats).  This iron church was later demolished as well, though, and the parish of Hazeleigh is now incorporated into that of Woodham Mortimer."]}, {"page": "William Stuart", "response": ["* William Horwood Stuart (1857\u20131906), British diplomat and vice-consul; assassinated in Batum, Georgia"]}, {"page": "Makhinjauri", "response": ["Owing to its subtropical climate and sulphur springs, the then-village Makhinjauri was developed into a resort under the Imperial Russian rule around 1904.
