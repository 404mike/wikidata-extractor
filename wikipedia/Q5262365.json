Light recorded several successful big band albums with an ace-group of New York studio musicians, many of whom were veterans of the bands of the Swing Era who were still regularly working in New York's television and recording studios. Released as Enoch Light and the Light Brigade, the arrangements used on the recordings were transcribed note-for-note from some of what were the hallmark recordings by many of the best bands of the swing era. The arranging reconstructions of these now \"classic\" arrangements were completely reconstructed by arrangers Dick Lieb, Dick Hyman, Tony Mottola and Jeff Hest. Many of the musicians employed for this series of \"recreations\" had been members of the original bands that made the original records decades earlier. This veritable \"Who's Who\" of \"swing era\" veteran musicians included saxophonists Phil Bodner, Walt Levinsky, (both also heavily featured on clarinet), Ray Beckenstein, Gerald Sanfino, Al Klink, Boomie Richman, Romeo Penque, and Sol Schlinger; trumpeters Mel Davis, Rusty Dedrick, Johnny Frosk, Bernie Glow, Joe Graves, Markie Markowicz, Bob McCoy, and Marvin Stamm; trombonists Wayne Andre, Paul Fralise, Urbie Green, Lou McGarity, Buddy Morrow, and Santo Russo; guitarist Tony Mottola, bassists Bob Haggart and George Duvivier, drummers Don Lamond, Bob Rosengarden and Ronnie Zito, pianists Dick Hyman and Derek Smith and vibraharpist Phil Kraus."]}, {"page": "Allan Ganley", "response": ["Ganley was born in Tolworth, Surrey, England.
