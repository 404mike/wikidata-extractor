He was born in Oxford.\nTaylor played for Hampshire's Second XI in 1993 at the age of 18, and the following year captained a National Association of Young Cricketers side against Minor Counties. He had a further outing for Gloucestershire seconds in 1995, but then dropped out of view for a while. In 1998 he played for Oxfordshire in the MCC Trophy, and three years later still he at last made his List A debut for the same county, against Huntingdonshire in the C&G Trophy at Vicarage Hill in East Challow (the only List A game ever played on that ground). It was not a happy occasion for Taylor: he made only 1 and Oxfordshire lost by 77 runs.\nTaylor's next List A game, in the first round of the same competition in August 2002 (though because of the vagaries of the fixture list, this was in fact the start of the 2003 competition), saw him playing for Buckinghamshire, and making by far his highest score at this level: 140 in a huge total of 424/5 which set up a crushing 230-run triumph over Suffolk at Dinton. He also played in Buckinghamshire's much closer (11-run) victory over Shropshire in the second round in September.\nFor the 2003 season Taylor was signed by Worcestershire with an eye to the first season of the Twenty20 Cup. His first innings was exactly what the county had been hoping for: opening the batting he produced a whirlwind knock of 46 from 20 balls, making a major contribution towards Worcestershire's nail-biting one-wicket victory over Northamptonshire. Unfortunately for him, single-figure scores in three further Twenty20 (and one National League) match spelt the end for him at New Road.\nIn 2004, after a few games for Berkshire, Taylor was picked up by Derbyshire to play exclusively one-day cricket for the rest of the season; Derbyshire's coach David Houghton had played with Taylor in club cricket and admired his hard hitting.\n\nHowever, he was not a success, with the only innings of real note being 29 against Middlesex in the totesport League: here he added 69 with Hassan Adnan after Derbyshire had slumped to 48/3. This proved to be Taylor's final innings for the county, however, since he was sacked by Houghton, who said that he had expected \"fireworks rather than Polyfilla\".\nSince then, Taylor has not played at the highest level of the domestic game, although he did appear in a minor match for Minor Counties against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and for Surrey's second team against MCC Young Cricketers, both in 2005.\nFollowing many years of successful club cricket, he set a world record in adult 50-over cricket by scoring 330 not out in just 160 balls for Totton & Eling cricket club on 5 May 2012. The number of sixes in the innings, 31, is also believed to be a world record.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Taylor", "response": ["* David Taylor (musician), with James Taylor Quartet", "* David Taylor (Home and Away), fictional character in the Australian soap opera Home and Away", "* David Taylor (actor) in The Adventures of the Black Stallion", "* David Taylor (writer), winner of the Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry", "* David Taylor (Green politician) (born 1957), UK Green Party politician", "* David Taylor (Labour politician) (1946\u20132009), UK Labour Party politician", "* David Taylor (Washington politician) (born 1972), politician from the US state of Washington", "* David Taylor (New Zealand diplomat) on List of ambassadors of New Zealand to South Korea", "* David Taylor (American football) (born 1949), American football player", "* David Taylor (football administrator) (1954\u20132014), General Secretary of UEFA", "* David Taylor (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131949), Scottish football player and manager, FA Cup winner with Bradford City in 1911 and 1914 with Burnley", "* David Taylor (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u2013?), English footballer for Darlington, Heart of Midlothian and Bristol Rovers", "* David Taylor (Welsh footballer) (born 1965), Welsh football player, European Golden Shoe winner", "* David Taylor (Canadian football) in 1986 CFL Draft", "* David Taylor (Nicaragua footballer) in 1997 UNCAF Nations Cup", "* David Taylor (rugby union), played in 1966\u201367 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "* David Taylor (Australian cricketer) (1881\u2013?)", "* David Taylor (chess player) (born 1941), International Correspondence Chess Federation United States champion", "* David Taylor (English cricketer) (born 1974)", "* David Taylor (snooker player) (born 1943), snooker player", "* David Taylor (wrestler, born 1990), American professional wrestler, Tokyo 2020 Olympic gold medalist in 86\u00a0kg", "* David Taylor (athlete) in 1995 European Cross Country Championships", "* David Taylor (basketball), player in 2012 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship", "* David Taylor (ice hockey), played in 2007 Memorial Cup", "* David Taylor (swimmer), participated in Swimming at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 50 metre freestyle S9", "* David Taylor (banker) (1929\u20132009), banker", "* David Taylor (veterinary surgeon) (1934\u20132013), television presenter on animal subjects", "* David Taylor (Wisconsin judge) (1818\u20131891), American jurist and legislator", "* David Taylor (programmer) on World Rugby"]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* David Taylor "]}, {"page": "Kent Street Senior High School", "response": ["* David Taylor -  cricket player with the Derbyshire County Cricket Club and the Worcestershire County Cricket Club"]}, {"page": "List of Buckinghamshire CCC List A records", "response": ["* Highest Score: 140 David Taylor v Suffolk, Dinton Cricket Club Ground, 2002", "* Most Runs in Season: 154 David Taylor, 2002", "|David Taylor|||| 154", "| 3rd || 131 || David Taylor & Paul Atkins || Suffolk || Dinton Park, Dinton || 2002"]}]}}
