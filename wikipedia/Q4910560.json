He made 23 league appearances during his four-year spell at the club. In July 1958, he was sold to Southend United in a part exchange deal which saw Southend's John McGuigan join Newcastle.

He went on to play for Sheffield United, Scunthorpe and Yarmouth Town.\nAt the end of his playing career, Punton moved into management, spending 20 years in charge of Great Yarmouth Town.
