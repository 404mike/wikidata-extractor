Luchetto Gattilusio, a Genoese poet, compared Charles directly with Charlemagne. Both reports demonstrate that Charles was regarded almost as an emperor. Among modern historians, Runciman says that Charles tried to build an empire in the eastern Mediterraneum; G\u00e9rard Siv\u00e9ry writes that he wanted to dominate the west; and Jean Dunbabin argues that his \"agglomeration of lands was in the process of forming an empire\"."]}, {"page": "Raymond III of Rouergue", "response": ["According to the Liber miraculorum Sancte Fidis (Book of the Miracles of Saint Faith), Raymond died while on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Prior to his departure, he gave the Abbey Church of Saint Foy twenty-one gilt silver vessels, an expensive gilt saddle and an estate on the Mediterranean coast with its saltworks. According to the Liber, he acquired the saddle as booty in a war against the Saracens.Pamela Sheingorn and Robert L. A. Clark (eds.), The Book of Sainte Foy (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995), 73.

During his time, Gascony was effectively independent, its duke a sovereign and any connection to the Kingdom of France theoretical. His reign fell during a period of relative peace and prosperity: the Peace of God movement had originated in Gascony in his father's time, monastic reform was introduced during his reign and the period of Viking attacks was over. Nonetheless, it was also a period of increasing feudal fragmentation, and Bernard died a violent death.Jean Dunbabin, France in the Making, 843\u20131180 (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 177.Michel Zimmerman, \"Western Francia: The Southern Principalities\", in Timothy Reuter (ed.), The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, c. 900 \u2013 c. 1024 (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 420\u201355, at 439\u201340."]}, {"page": "The English Historical Review", "response": ["1999-2001 JH Maddicott and Jean Dunbabin", "2001 Jean Dunbabin and John Rowlatt", "2001-04 Jean Dunbabin and George W.

France was more stable in the eleventh century than the tenth, and in the first century of Capetian rule relatively fewer noblemen than in the previous century were successful at building up principalities by a combination of inheritance, marriage, usurpation and force. Jean Dunbabin argues there were only two such ephemeral principalities formed in the eleventh century: Ralph's northern principality and a southern one forged by the marriage of Robert II of Auvergne and Bertha of Rouergue in 1064/66. After Ralph's death, Robert II tried to arrange a marriage between his daughter Judith and Ralph's son, but the arrangements fell through when Simon became a monk and Judith a nun."]}, {"page": "Dunbabin", "response": ["* Jean Dunbabin, honorary fellow of St Anne's College, University of Oxford."]}]}}
