The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King's Sedgemoor Drain. Galton's Canal was a  canal with one lock, connecting the River Brue to the North Drain. It was operational by 1822, and ceased to be used after the 1850s. The land is drained by a series of rhynes, or ditches with water levels (and hence the level of the water table) being controlled by a system of sluice gates and pumps. The water resource management operations are managed by the Somerset internal drainage board."]}, {"page": "Samuel \"John\" Galton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Galton Jr."]}, {"page": "Galton's Canal", "response": ["Few details of the canal have survived, and the main source of information about it comes from a paper submitted to the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England by Erasmus Galton, and published in 1845. The journal was chosen because the main purpose of the canal was the improvement of a peat bog, to provide agricultural land. In 1811, Samuel Galton Jr., a financier from Duddeston, in Birmingham, owned  of peat bog in the parish of Meare, which formed part of Westhay Moor. The moor had been split up into tenements by an Act of Parliament in 1790, but most of it remained unimproved, and was only suitable for the cutting of turf, which was used as a fuel.", "Samuel Galton set out to improve his holding, and the project was managed by his agent, a Mr. Richard Hammett, who came from the village of Street. Hammett would later provide the initial survey of the Glastonbury Canal, and it was his notes that Erasmus Galton used to prepare his article. Local opinion was that such land could not be improved, because any top dressing of soil would soon sink below the peat, and the effort expended would be wasted. However, Galton believed that if the land was drained properly before top dressing began, loss of the soil did not occur, and the land remained improved. His process consisted of dividing the land into ridges, which were  wide, and cutting ditches at both sides. Peat was moved from the edges of the ridge to its centre, and over a period of 4 to 5 years, the peat compressed, and the surface sank by around , but was firm enough to support cattle. The cost for this first stage was given as \u00a34 2s 6d (\u00a34.12) per acre (\u00a310.30 per ha)."]}, {"page": "John Howard Galton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Galton Jr."]}, {"page": "Samuel Galton, Jr.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Samuel Galton Jr."]}]}}
