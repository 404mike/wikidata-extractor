She worked on the BBC's Newsnight programme and was the reporter on an expos\u00e9 of Sir Jimmy Savile as a paedophile which was controversially cancelled by the BBC in December 2011. The decision to axe the Newsnight investigation became the subject of the Pollard Inquiry. She and colleague Meirion Jones later won a London Press Club Scoop of the Year award for their work on the story. She also won the 2010 Daniel Pearl Award for her investigation of the Trafigura toxic dumping scandal.\nMacKean went freelance after leaving the BBC, and reported on the Cyril Smith case for Channel 4's Dispatches series in September 2013.\nIn 2014, she reported on Russian vigilante gangs entrapping and attacking gay men in the documentary Hunted. Hunted won multiple awards, including the Grierson award for best current affairs documentary, and led to a follow-up, Hunted: Gay and Afraid, in which MacKean challenged American evangelical groups who support anti-gay legislation around the world.\nMacKean was named Journalist of the Year by Stonewall in 2014, in November 2015, she was named their Journalist of the Decade.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newsnight", "response": ["In the weeks after the ITV documentary Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile was broadcast on 3 October 2012, allegations were made that a Newsnight investigation into Savile by reporter Liz MacKean and producer Meirion Jones in December 2011 had been dropped shortly before transmission because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after Savile's death.  The BBC appointed Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, to examine why the investigation was dropped.

The decision to pull the Newsnight investigation eventually led to a major crisis in public trust of the BBC. The later Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean had found cogent evidence that Savile was an abuser and that the programme could have exposed Savile in 2011 but a flawed decision was made not to broadcast. There was no public mention of the Newsnight investigation into Savile at the time but In early 2012, several newspapers reported that BBC had investigated allegations of sexual abuse immediately after Savile's death, but the report was not broadcast.
