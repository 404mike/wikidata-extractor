He became the leading minister of the United Secession Church. His Life of Knox (1813) ranks high among biographies for the ability and learning which it displays, and was the means of vindicating the great Reformer from a cloud of prejudice and misunderstanding in which he had been enveloped. It was followed by a Life of Andrew Melville (1819), Knox's successor as the leader of the Reformers in Scotland, also a work of great merit. M'Crie also published histories of the Reformation in Italy and Spain. He received an honourary degree of D.D. in 1813, the first Secession minister, to receive such an award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Thomas M'Crie the Elder (1772\u20131835), pastor and historian (wrote the 'Life of John Knox')"]}, {"page": "Duns, Scottish Borders", "response": ["* Reverend Thomas M'Crie (1772\u20131835), historian and divine"]}, {"page": "James Melville (Scottish minister)", "response": ["The Diary was printed by the Bannatyne Club in 1829, and by the Wodrow Society in 1842.

Erskine was appointed sheriff depute of Orkney on 6 June 1809, and in 1814 Scott accompanied him and other friends on a voyage to Orkney. Lockhart ascribes to Erskine the critical estimate of the Waverley novels included in Scott's own notice in the Quarterly Review of Old Mortality, in answer to the sectarian attacks of Thomas M'Crie the Elder against his representation of the covenanters. By Scott's unwearied exertions on his behalf Erskine was in January 1822 promoted to the bench as Lord Kinneder. The charge against him of an improper liaison, a sex scandal with Mrs Burt, a well known prostitute from Edinburgh, so seriously affected his health and spirits that, though it was proved to be utterly groundless, he never recovered from the shock caused by the accusation.Christie's. Lot notes for the painting William Erskine, Lord Kinnedder (1756\u20131822) It \"struck\", said Scott, \"into his heart and soul\"; he became nerveless and despondent, was finally attacked by fever and delirium, and died on 14 August 1822. Lockhart states that he never saw Scott \"in such a state of dejection\" as when he accompanied him in attendance upon Kinneder's funeral. At the time George IV was paying his memorable visit to Edinburgh, and Scott, owing to his grief, plunged into the gaiety of the moment with an aching heart. \"If ever a pure spirit quitted this vale of tears\", wrote Sir Walter to a friend, \"it was William Erskine's. I must turn to, and see what can be done about getting some pension for his daughters.\" Lockhart thought that Erskine was \"the only man in whose society Scott took great pleasure, during the more vigorous part of his life, that had neither constitution nor inclination for any of the rough bodily exercise in which he himself delighted.\" If, as Erskine supposed, Redmond in Rokeby is meant for a portrait of himself, Lockhart must have exaggerated Erskine's effeminacy. Erskine wrote several Scottish songs.one of which is published in James Maidment's Court of Session Garland (1839), p. 110."]}, {"page": "Thomas McCrie the Elder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas M'Crie the Elder"]}, {"page": "Thomas McCrie the elder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas M'Crie the Elder"]}, {"page": "Thomas M'Crie the elder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas M'Crie the Elder"]}]}}
