Different states can have different levels of corporate tax or franchise tax, different qualities of shareholder and stakeholder rights, more or less stringent directors' duties, and so on. However, it was held by the Supreme Court in Paul v Virginia that in principle states ought to allow corporations incorporated in a different state to do business freely. and see Henry N. Butler, Nineteenth century jurisdictional competition in the granting of corporate privileges (1985) 14(1) Journal of Legal Studies 129 This appeared to remain true even if another state (e.g. Delaware) required significantly worse internal protections for shareholders, employees, creditors than the state in which the corporation operated (e.g. New York). So far, federal regulation has affected more issues relating to the securities markets than the balance of power and duties among directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that one state's laws will govern the \"internal affairs\" of a corporation, to prevent conflicts among state laws.See Edgar v MITE Corp,  White J., citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 302, Comment b, pp. 307\u2013308 (1971) Also VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v Examen Inc, 871 A2d 1108, 1113 (2005) 'The internal affairs doctrine applies to those matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholder.' So on the present law, regardless of where a corporation operates in the 50 states, the rules of the state of incorporation (subject to federal law) will govern its operation.Contrast the European Union decisions, including Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd (2003) C-167/01 and see Simon Deakin, Two Types of Regulatory Competition: Competitive Federalism versus Reflexive Harmonisation. A Law and Economics Perspective on Centros (1999) 2 Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies 231 Early in the 20th century, it was recognized by some states, initially New Jersey, that the state could cut its tax rate in order to attract more incorporations, and thus bolster tax receipts.See WL Cary, 'Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections on Delaware' (1974) 83(4) Yale Law Journal 663, 664, noting how under Woodrow Wilson acting as governor tightened New Jersey law, provoking Delaware to change its regulation. Quickly, Delaware emerged as a preferred state of incorporation.See William Ripley, Wall Street and Main Street (1927) 30, 'The little state of Delaware has always been forward in this chartermongering business.' In the 1933 case of Louis K. Liggett Co v Lee, Brandeis J. represented the view that the resulting \"race was one not of diligence, but of laxity\", particularly in terms of corporate tax rates, and rules that might protect less powerful corporate stakeholders. Over the 20th century, the problem of a \"race to the bottom\" was increasingly thought to justify Federal regulation of corporations. The contrasting view was that regulatory competition among states could be beneficial, on the assumption that shareholders would choose to invest their money with corporations that were well governed. Thus the state's corporation regulations would be \"priced\" by efficient markets. In this way it was argued to be a \"race to the top\".See RK Winter, 'State Law, Shareholder Protection, and the Theory of the Corporation' (1977) 6 J Leg Studies 251 An intermediate viewpoint in the academic literature,This is vast. See K Kocaoglu, 'A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law' (2008) Georgetown University Law Center Working Paper, on SSRN suggested that regulatory competition could in fact be either positive or negative, and could be used to the advantage of different groups, depending on which stakeholders would exercise most influence in the decision about which state to incorporate in.e.g. W Bratton, 'Corporate Law's Race to Nowhere in Particular' (1994) 44 U Toronto LJ 401. See also Under most state laws, directors hold the exclusive power to allow a vote on amending the articles of incorporation, and shareholders must approve directors' proposals by a majority, unless a higher threshold is in the articles."]}, {"page": "Adam Smith Professor of Corporate Governance", "response": ["* 2001-2006   Simon Deakin  FBA"]}, {"page": "Leximetrics", "response": ["La Porta, Lopez, Shleifer and Vishny's studies, although picked up by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, were widely criticised for failing to disclose their methodology adequately, misunderstanding the law in multiple jurisdictions, oversimplifying complex legal problems, and bias. Before long other researchers, such as those at the Cambridge Judge Business School, Centre for Business Research, led by Simon Deakin, began undertaking parallel studies. These sought to do the same work but more accurately, and usually came to the opposite conclusions. For example, it was found that when measured more accurately, and over time, common law countries were not outperformed by civil law countries in various shareholders' protection measures, and that labour law was in fact positive for economic development in most cases."]}, {"page": "S Deakin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Deakin"]}, {"page": "Endorsements in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)", "response": ["*Simon Deakin, Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2000s", "response": ["* Professor Simon Deakin (University of Cambridge), Law"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Law Society", "response": ["The Society's official termly magazine, Per Incuriam, features content by students as well as notable academics and professionals.

Memetics provides a model for the cultural transmission of information by using a genetic metaphor related to the movement and alteration of genes. As Simon Deakin notes, memetics supposes 'patterns of cultural evolution are closely analogous to those which occur in the natural world as a result of the interaction between genes, organisms, and environments.' Deakin provides a theory of legal memetics resting on three theses. First, that legal change is cumulative and successive changes can give rise to 'complex, multi-functional legal institutions'. Second, that legal systems are adaptive though do not optimise to become more efficient. They are constrained by history without tending towards an optimal state. Third, he argues legal concepts act like genes, encoding information about society and the world, and are passed down in a manner analogous to genetic inheritance. According to legal memetics, legal forms, like biological adaption, often outlive their initial purposes and can be adopted later in different contexts. This can lead to 'lock in', a form of path dependence, where a particular legal innovation has a long-lasting influence by increasing the cost of switching to a different legal model. In a similar manner, biological adaptation often involves the repurposing of prior adaptations which can constrain possible future routes.Dennett, D. Darwin's Dangerous Idea (Harmondsworth, 1995) These kinds of phenomena are extremely common in legal systemsBasil Markesinis and Simon Deakin, Tort Law, 4th edn. (Oxford, 1999), 532-54. and suggest legal concepts contain information about the prior environments which have shaped them."]}]}}
