From that time in 1996, Simply Red was essentially a trade name for Hucknall and a bevy of session musicians, which would vary from track to track (and gig to gig) as needed, although all post-1996 Simply Red albums and live shows did include contributions from sax player Ian Kirkham. Returning drummer Gota Yashiki (co-producing several album tracks) and backing vocalist Dee Johnson were also frequently involved with the band's later recordings and shows, as was new keyboardist/co-producer Andy Wright.", "Between 2003 and its disbandment in 2010, the band's official line-up for live performances was Mick Hucknall (vocals), Ian Kirkham (saxophone/keyboards), Dave Clayton (keyboards), Kenji Suzuki (guitar), Kevin Robinson (trumpet/flugelhorn/percussion), Steve Lewinson (bass guitar) and Pete Lewinson (drums). These musicians featured on Simply Red's albums as well, though they were often augmented or replaced by session musicians. From 2003 to 2008, John Johnson (trombone), Dee Johnson (vocals), Sarah Brown (vocals) and Chris De Margary (saxophone) also appeared on both albums and tours.", "*Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone, EWI, keyboards (1986\u20132010, 2015\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Snowed In", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "List of people from Preston", "response": ["*Ian Kirkham \u2014 saxophone player, Simply Red"]}, {"page": "Something Got Me Started", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "Stars (Simply Red album)", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "Home (Simply Red album)", "response": ["Credited musicians are (in order listed):  Andy Wright, Anthea Clarke, Arthur Adams, Bernie Worrell, Chris de Margary, Danny Saxon, Dave Clayton, Dean Parks, Dee Johnson, Freddie Washington, Gota Yashiki, Ian Kirkham, James Gadson, Joe Sample, John Johnson, Karl Vanden Bossche, Kenji Suzuki, Kevin Robinson, Larry Williams, Lenny Castro, London Session Orchestra, Mark Jaimes, Mick Hucknall, Miles Bould, Paul \"Harry\" Harris, Pete Lewinson, Sarah Brown & Steve Lewinson."]}, {"page": "Life (Simply Red album)", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone, EWI, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Simplified (album)", "response": ["Credited musicians are: Sarah Brown, Anthea Clarke, Dave Clayton, Simon Hale, Geoff Holroyde, Mark Jamies, Dee Johnson, John Johnson, Ian Kirkham, Pete Lewinson, Steve Lewinson, Chris De Margary, Roachie, Kevin Robinson, Danny Saxon, Kenji Suzuki, Andy Wright, Gota Yashiki."]}, {"page": "Men and Women (album)", "response": ["*Ian Kirkham \u2013 tenor and baritone saxophones"]}, {"page": "A New Flame", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham\u00a0\u2013 saxophones"]}, {"page": "Love and the Russian Winter", "response": ["*Ian Kirkham - saxophone"]}, {"page": "Heitor (album)", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham - Alto saxophone"]}, {"page": "Stay (Simply Red album)", "response": [":Ian Kirkham"]}, {"page": "X (Kylie Minogue album)", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 alto saxophone, electronic wind instrument "]}, {"page": "Tribute to Bobby", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "It's That Girl Again", "response": ["* Ian Kirkham \u2013 saxophones (5)"]}, {"page": "ITV Specials", "response": ["| Mick HucknallIan KirkhamSteve LewinsonKenji SuzukiPete LewinsonDave ClaytonKevin Robinson"]}, {"page": "Kirkham (surname)", "response": ["*Ian Kirkham (born 1963), English saxophonist "]}, {"page": "Big Love (Simply Red album)", "response": ["*Ian Kirkham  \u2013 saxophone on 1, 2, 10, 11"]}]}}
