Firefighters made a decision to deliberately collapse the roof of the South Transept by pouring tens of thousands of gallons of water onto it, in order to save the rest of the building from destruction. A total of 114 firefighters from across North Yorkshire responded to the fire and contained it, while York Minster's staff and clergy rushed to preserve historical objects in the building. The glass of the South Transept rose window was shattered by the heat but the lead held it together, allowing it to be taken down for restoration. A subsequent investigation found an 80% chance that the fire was caused by a lightning strike to a metal electrical box atop the roof, a 10% chance that the fire was caused by arson, and a 10% chance that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Some traditionalist Anglicans suggested the fire was a sign of divine displeasure at the recent consecration as Bishop of Durham of David Jenkins, whose views they considered heterodox."]}, {"page": "David Jenkins", "response": ["David Jenkins may refer to:", "* David Jenkins (composer) (1848\u20131915), Welsh composer", "* David Jenkins (musician) (born 1947), singer for the band Pablo Cruise", "* David Jenkins (television writer), creator of People of Earth", "* David Jenkins, set designer", "* David Jenkins (North Carolina), 18th Century North Carolina politician", "* David Jenkins (Georgia politician), American politician from Georgia", "* David Jenkins (bishop) (1925\u20132016), of Durham", "* David Jenkins (Archdeacon of Westmorland and Furness) (1929\u20132014), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (archdeacon of Sudbury) (born 1961), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1904) (1904\u20131951), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Wales", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1914) (1914\u20131979), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Cardiff ", "* David Jenkins (figure skater) (born 1936), American figure skater", "* David Jenkins (footballer) (born 1946), English footballer for Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur", "* David Jenkins (sprinter) (born 1952), Scottish athlete", "* David Jenkins (Olympic diving coach) (1989-2021), Team Great Britain Olympic diving coach", "* David Jenkins (Royalist) (1582\u20131663), Welsh judge and Royalist during the English Civil War", "* David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins (1899\u20131969), British Law Lord", "* David Jenkins (librarian) (1912\u20132002), Welsh librarian", "* David Jenkins (British Army officer), British Army major general", "* David Jenkins, journalist and editor of GameCentral"]}, {"page": "Spitting Image", "response": ["Archbishop Robert Runcie, Mary Whitehouse and Cliff Richard were portrayed as Christian censors.

His film credits include We Make Ships (1988), Channel 4; Tell Them in Gdansk (1989), Channel 4 - \"The end of shipbuilding on the River Wear was announced in December 1988, but many shipyard workers refused to give up the fight. This film centres on a party held for the redundant shop stewards and their families and combines the music of the Flying Pickets and the humour of comedian Mike Elliott to illustrate the ironies of the closure. The title highlights Mrs Thatcher's support for the striking shipyard workers in Gda\u0144sk while shutting down UK yards; Birmingham Is What I Think With (1991), Arts Council England--about the poet Roy Fisher; The Shadow and the Substance (1994), Channel 4. The Shadow and the Substance (the title is a quote from John Clare\u2019s poem on enclosure) examined the nature of work in an increasingly high-tech environment. In the film Rosemary Cramp, Emeritus Professor of Archaeology at Durham, discusses the basic human need and dignity in \"labour\" in prehistoric times as do redundant shipyard workers from Sunderland and Tyneside. This was contrasted with the \"psychic need\" to work as seen by the Adam Smith Institute justifying the paying of slave labour wages. It also featured the Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, on the morality of the poor stealing food. The Durham Miners\u2019 Gala featured Tony Benn speaking about privatisation eroding morality and citizenship. Young women working at a new Fujitsu semiconductor plant situated in a former mining area are asked if they feel secure in their jobs. This was to be the future, replacing mining and heavy industry. Their manager admits \"humans contaminate the product\". (The factory later closed with a loss of 600 jobs during Tony Blair\u2019s premiership.) The film concludes with a visit to the philosopher Andre Gorz who predicts the collapse of \"work\" and posits a radical alternative for trade unionist and socialists."]}]}}
