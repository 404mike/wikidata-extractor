He played as a forward.\nGodfrey was born in Waleswood, near Rotherham. He scored freely in wartime competition, but was unable to settle when the Football League began again. He scored on his debut for Birmingham in the Second Division on the opening day of the first post-war season, in a 4\u20131 home win against Hull City, but by the end of that season he had moved to Merthyr Town via both Coventry City and Manchester City.
