However, the concepts with regard to system and organization are not definitely pointed out in theory. On the part of system theory there is hardly any link to the modern theory of social systems with their core concepts of the observed observer and the autopoiesis. On the part of organizational theory, Karl E. Weick described the problem that the term organization leaves open in how far a special behavior of an involved person takes place at a certain place or refers to a certain place very early on. In the same manner it is not clear in how far behavior is controlled by an organization or contributes to the embodiment of an organization or if both or none of this is true. Gareth Morgan also alluded to the fact that organizations can be analyzed from different perspectives. Dependent upon the perspective the analysis yields pronouncedly different implications for the design, change, and the guiding- and leadership concepts.", "Gareth Morgan (1986) Images of Organization, Sage"]}]}}
