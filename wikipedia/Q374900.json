Lewis's friendship with Coghill and Tolkien grew during their time as members of the Kolb\u00edtar, an Old Norse reading group that Tolkien founded and which ended around the time of the inception of the Inklings. At Oxford, he was the tutor of poet John Betjeman, critic Kenneth Tynan, mystic Bede Griffiths, novelist Roger Lancelyn Green and Sufi scholar Martin Lings, among many other undergraduates.

Olivier's portrayal (directed by Glen Byam Shaw, with Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece.

At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City.

It was controversial because of Lady Macbeth's being nude in a scene, and received an X rating because of its graphic violence and nudity. In his autobiography, Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate's murder would be subject to scrutiny and probable criticism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous."]}, {"page": "Samuel Beckett", "response": ["Blin's knowledge of French theatre and vision alongside Beckett knowing what he wanted the play to represent contributed greatly to its success.

It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in The Sunday Times and, later, Kenneth Tynan. After the showing in Miami, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany.

After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as \"one of the worst errors of judgment\" he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, \"made more sense\u00a0... than the usual battle-axe\" portrayal of the character.

He was thought unconvincingly villainous; the influential young critic Kenneth Tynan professed himself \"unmoved to the point of paralysis,\" though blaming the director more than the star.Tynan, p. 107 Richardson's third and final role in the Stratford season, Volpone in Ben Jonson's play, received much better, but not ecstatic, notices.\"Stratford Festival\", The Times 16 July 1952, p. 9; and \"Jonson on Avon\", The Observer, 20 June 1952, p. 6 He did not play at Stratford again.", "Richardson thought himself temperamentally unsuited to the great tragic roles, and most reviewers agreed, but to critics of several generations he was peerless in classic comedies. Kenneth Tynan judged any Falstaff against Richardson's, which he considered \"matchless\",Tynan, pp. 98 and 102 and Gielgud judged \"definitive\".Gielgud (1979), p. 92 Richardson, though hardly ever satisfied with his own performances, evidently believed he had done well as Falstaff.

Reviews were mixed. Most of the critics who attended the first night felt it was a failure, and it looked as if the English Stage Company was going to go into liquidation., cite a letter from Stephen Daldry \"I have in our archives letters from members of the audience from the original production of Look Back in Anger demanding their money back. Had we honoured every one of those requests, this theatre would not have been able to survive\" Milton Shulman in the Evening Standard, for example, called the play \"a failure\" and \"a self-pitying snivel\". But the following Sunday, Kenneth Tynan of The Observer \u2013 the most influential critic of the day \u2013 praised it to the skies: \"I could not love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger\", he wrote, \"It is the best young play of its decade\". Harold Hobson of The Sunday Times called Osborne \"a writer of outstanding promise\". During production the married Osborne began a relationship with Mary Ure, and would divorce his wife, Pamela Lane, to marry Ure in 1957.", "Osborne and Gilliatt were married for five years (together for seven), and became the parents of his only natural daughter, Nolan.The name was chosen in honour of Captain Nolan, who led the famous Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War. At the time of her birth, Osborne was researching that war and writing the screenplay of the film his next wife would star in. (Osborne, p. 240) Osborne had an abusive relationship with his daughter: he cast her out of his house when she was 17; they never spoke again. Osborne and Gilliatt's marriage suffered through what Osborne perceived to be an unnecessary obsession on her part with her work, writing film reviews for The Observer. \"I tried to point out that it seemed an inordinate amount of time and effort to expend on a thousand-word review to be read by a few thousand film addicts and forgotten almost at once.\" Osborne, a misogynist, wanted Gilliatt to give up her careers as a film critic, theatre critic, short story writer, novelist, opera librettist, screenwriter, and writer of books on movie comedy and film directors, and move with him to a country house where she would tend his needs, including his growing alcoholism. Osborne had put a refrigerator in the couple's bedroom and filled it with champagne to alleviate his night terrors, which Gilliatt helped guide him through. Behind her back, he conducted a long-term affair with Jill Bennett, who passed herself off as Gilliatt's best friend. Kenneth Tynan described Osborne and Bennett's behavior as the most duplicitous that he had ever witnessed. It was only after this betrayal that Gilliatt's drinking increased. She refused to give up her ambitions and careers and Osborne demonized her for it. He remained a misogynist and homophobe until the end of his life."]}, {"page": "South Pacific (musical)", "response": ["When South Pacific opened in London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed.

In the 1970s, she was interviewed extensively on film for the documentaries Memories of Berlin: The Twilight of Weimar Culture (1976), produced and directed by Gary Conklin, and Hollywood (1980), by Brownlow and David Gill. Lulu in Berlin (1984) is another rare filmed interview, produced by Richard Leacock and Susan Woll, released a year before her death but filmed a decade earlier. In 1979, she was profiled by the film writer Kenneth Tynan in his essay \"The Girl in the Black Helmet\", the title an allusion to her bobbed hair, worn since childhood. In 1982, writer Tom Graves was allowed into Brooks's small apartment for an interview, and later wrote about the often awkward and tense conversation in his article \"My Afternoon with Louise Brooks\"."]}]}}
