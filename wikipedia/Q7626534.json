Then in the 109th minute of the match Hereford won a throw in. Substitute Stuart Fleetwood received the ball from Ryan Green but was tackled. The ball ran loose to Green who deftly clipped the ball into the far corner of the goal with his left foot, scoring what was only the second senior goal of his career. With eleven minutes to go it looked as if Hereford had done enough for victory. However the drama was not over as Hereford goalkeeper Wayne Brown received a head injury after going for a ball. With all substitutions now made it looked at one stage as though Hereford would need an emergency goalkeeper, and midfielder Ferrell even had a spare goalkeeper's jersey on for a moment. But, after several minutes, Brown recovered and play resumed although there was six minutes of stoppage time added on. Halifax tried everything to equalise, putting centre-back Adam Quinn up front who had a shot destined for the top corner well saved by Brown.", "|FW ||7 ||Stuart Fleetwood || || "]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Football Conference", "response": ["|1||align=left| Stuart Fleetwood ||align=left| Forest Green Rovers || 28||0||6||2||36"]}, {"page": "List of Hereford United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Stuart Fleetwood"]}, {"page": "John Paul Kissock", "response": ["Having already scored against Lincoln for Southport on the opening day of the season, Kissock appeared against them for the second time in two months on 17 September when Luton were pitted against them at Kenilworth Road.

With six minutes left to play, standing near the left-hand corner of the penalty area and the goal line, he received a short corner from Adam Watkins. Kissock twisted past a Lincoln defender, and turning quickly, ran towards the net along the byline; from a tight angle he crossed the ball low for forward Stuart Fleetwood, who was waiting in the middle of the six-yard box. In the words of the official club match report, Fleetwood \"couldn't miss\" from such short range; he prodded the ball home to score the only goal of the game.
