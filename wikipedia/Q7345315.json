One of her children died in infancy, and her husband died from Spanish flu in 1918, leaving her a financially troubled widow. She succeeded her father in 1927, and immediately set about reinforcing her feudal rights and promoting tourism on the island, which she affectionately called \"the last bastion of feudalism\".

Robert was not aware that the marriage made him jure uxoris seigneur of Sark, his wife's co-ruler, until they set foot on the island. Hathaway's strong personality, however, ensured that she had the final say in the matters of government; while her husband attended government meetings as seigneur, she accompanied him to \"give advice\". Lecture tours in the United States, aided by her second husband's connections, were part of her efforts to promote tourism and bring more revenue to the island.", "Sibyl and Robert Hathaway's happy marriage ended with his death in 1954, six years after the death of her eldest child, Bridget.
