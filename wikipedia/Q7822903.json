The acknowledgement by Ford of good design from other manufacturers was praised by the press, however the design of the Scorpio itself received universal condemnation, and the focus group failed to placate the media regarding the car's appearance, who would later go on to viciously attack the styling on release.left|thumb|Ford Scorpio Mk II saloonthumb|left|Ford Scorpio MK II estate On release, the styling was immediately criticised in both the automotive press and the non-automotive mainstream media, with entire pages in the latter attacking the aesthetics. Tony Mason of Top Gear disliked the front, saying that the headlamps looked out of place and the car looked incomplete, Edward Stobart described the car as 'the ugliest car in Britain', particularly disliking the 'featureless' rear, saying that it did not look as good as the BMW 7-Series, while Ken Greenley of the Royal College of Art (designer of the SsangYong Musso and Rodius) disliked the entire design philosophy. Described as 'just plain ugly', 'like one of those fairground cars with a silly face on the front', 'like something out of Walt Disney, someone has gone on acid and tripped to the Seventies for the front', and 'designed by a committee of people in sunglasses sitting in the dark'. Other reviewers were even more scathing, one saying that 'it doesn't have much of a personality... the front of the car is like a face with a huge beaming smile... it looks a bit ridiculous really', another describing the front end as ' like someone's just rammed a banana up its bottom', and another remarking 'I wouldn't feel proud of this... it's the ugliest car going'."]}, {"page": "Mason (surname)", "response": ["*Tony Mason, British rally co-driver"]}, {"page": "Rally Report", "response": ["It was transmitted on BBC2 from 1984BBC Genome Project - BBC2 listings 24 November 1984 until 1998 and usually featured previews, a live stage, twice nightly reports and a wrap-up compilation.
