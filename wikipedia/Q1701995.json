He is mainly known for being a member of Siouxsie and the Banshees from mid-1984 until early 1987.\nIn the early 1980s, he joined Sheffield band Clock DVA after the release of their second studio album. His first recording with Clock DVA was the EP Passions Still Aflame in 1982. It was followed by the album Advantage in 1983.\nHe was then recruited by Siouxsie and the Banshees to be a full-time member of the group from May 1984. With the Banshees, he recorded The Thorn EP (1984), and two studio albums Tinderbox in 1986, and the covers album Through the Looking Glass in 1987. He left the band in January 1987. \nCarruthers teamed up with his friend drummer Paul Ferguson to form the band Crush with American musicians. They released a self-titled album in 1993. That year, he also played guitars on Lloyd Cole's third solo album Bad Vibes, and also took part in the album Wishing Well by Californian band Ten Wings. In 2007, while in New York, he co-composed several songs with Kim Fahy's group the Mabuses on their album Mabused!.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["Ex-Clock DVA guitarist John Valentine Carruthers replaced him. The Banshees then reworked four numbers from their repertoire, augmented by a string section, for The Thorn EP. NME praised the project at its release: \"The power of a classical orchestra is the perfect foil for the band's grindingly insistent sounds\". The new Banshees lineup spent much of 1985 working on a new record, Tinderbox. The group finished the song \"Cities in Dust\" before the album, so they rushed its release as a single prior to their longest tour of the UK. Tinderbox was finally released in April 1986. Sounds magazine noted: \"Tinderbox is a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette\". Due to the length of time spent working on Tinderbox, the group desired spontaneity and decided to record an album of cover songs, Through the Looking Glass, in 1987. Mojo magazine later praised their version of \"Strange Fruit\". After the album's release, the band realised Carruthers was no longer fitting in and decided to work on new material as a trio."]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*John Valentine Carruthers (Siouxsie and the Banshees)"]}, {"page": "Carruthers", "response": ["*John Valentine Carruthers (born 1958), English musician, Siouxsie and the Banshees"]}, {"page": "Tinderbox (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)", "response": ["Tinderbox is the seventh studio album by English rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees.
