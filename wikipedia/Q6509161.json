Homer's departure from EastEnders was announced in late 1998, along with that of his co-star Andrew Lynford.

Gay campaigning group Stonewall's spokesman Matt Aston commented on this, saying: \"Gay characters did seem to be on the rise for a while, but now they've got a bit of a low profile. We'd like to see a few more positive role models in the media, especially to encourage young people who are coming to terms with their sexuality, as well as their friends and members of their family.\" However, Aston praised the way Tony's sexuality was handled, saying, \"It was very good for breaking what had been a taboo on prime-time television. It was a positive portrayal of how people can be confused about their sexuality. And as with any kind of exposure of these issues, people are made more aware of them and the problems people have with their sexuality. People also link them with us and get in touch to talk about it.\" EastEnders first gay kiss attracted criticism, but it was noted that by the time Tony and Simon had their first kiss, \"fewer feathers were left to be ruffled.\""]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by Emmerdale", "response": ["| Best Actress || Leah Bracknell || ", "| Best Dramatic Performance || Leah Bracknell || ", "| Best Exit || Leah Bracknell || ", "| rowspan=\"3\"| 2003 || Best Actress || Leah Bracknell ||  || align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"| ", "| Best Actress || Leah Bracknell || ", "| rowspan=\"4\"| 2002 || Most Popular Actress || Leah Bracknell ||  || align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|", "| Best Soap Actress || Leah Bracknell || "]}, {"page": "List of Emmerdale characters (1989)", "response": ["The following is a list of characters that first appeared in the British soap opera Emmerdale in 1989, by order of first appearance.
