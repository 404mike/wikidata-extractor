He was accompanied on some of his travels by William Jackson Hooker and by Charles Cardale Babington.  Borrer was particularly interested in lichens, willows, roses and succulents although had a very broad knowledge of plants. He was particularly good at recording plant identifications but often omitted the date and location where the plant was collected. He was also frequently consulted about identifications. He attempted to grow many plant species in his garden so that he could distinguish key identification characteristics without concerns that differences were caused by different habitats. In W. A. Clarke's First Records of British Flowering Plants published in 1897, Borrer was credited as the first to identify 21 species of flowering plants at locations from Cornwall to Caithness. These included Isnardia palustris at Buxted in 1827 and the grass Leersia oryzoides at Henfield Levels in 1844 and several willows. He also identified several marine algae and lichens.He met and corresponded with other botanists in the UK and abroad including Joseph Banks, Dawson Turner, Hewett Cottrell Watson and Joseph Hooker and exchanged plant specimens with them. Borrer was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1805 as well Fellow of the Royal Society in 1835. He was also a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society based in Edinburgh. Borrer was one of those who proposed William Hooker for fellowship of the Linnean Society in 1806.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Jackson Hooker", "response": ["In 1807, Hooker was bitten by an adder when walking near Burgh Castle and badly hurt. He was found by friends and taken to Dawson Turner's house, where he was cared for until he recovered completely from the effects of the snake's bite. Once he had fully recovered, he accompanied Turner and his wife Mary on a tour of Scotland. In 1808 he again travelled to Scotland, this time accompanied by his friend William Borrer. During this journey he discovered a new species of moss, Andreaea nivalis, on Ben Nevis, which may have led to him publishing a paper Some Observations on the Genus Andreaea in 1810."]}, {"page": "Henfield", "response": ["Started in the 1930s, Henfield Museum moved to its current location in the Henfield Hall in 1974.

In 1855 the tower was restored by an unknown architect. In 1870 and 1871 a large-scale restoration was undertaken to the designs of the architects William Slater and Richard Carpenter. Most of the walls were refaced with flint, the chancel was lengthened eastward and raised in height, a new south chancel chapel was built, both aisles were entirely rebuilt, the roof of the nave was opened up and new clerestory lancet windows installed."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1835", "response": ["# William Borrer (1781\u20131862), botanist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* William Borrer (1781\u20141862), botanist"]}, {"page": "Punctelia subflava", "response": ["The lichen was first formally described in 1847 as Parmelia subflava by botanist Thomas Taylor. The type specimen, described from the herbarium collection of William Borrer, was collected on Tasmania (called Van Diemen's Land in the original publication). Taylor compared it to the common species Parmelia sulcata, noting that it was smaller, and had neither a reticulated surface nor the retuse lobes (having an obtuse or rounded apex with a shallow notch) characteristic of that widespread species. John Elix and Jen Johnston transferred Parmelia subflava to the genus Punctelia in 1988. Several years earlier, David Galloway and Elix had proposed Parmelia subflava to be synonymous with Punctelia rudecta. It is now known that Punctelia rudecta is a Northern Hemisphere species and does not occur in Australasia."]}, {"page": "Punctelia borreri", "response": ["Punctelia borreri is named after William Borrer, a botanist who made the first scientific collections of the lichen in early 19th-century England. James Edward Smith was the first to publish a scientific description of the species in 1807, followed independently a year later by Dawson Turner. It was later assigned as the type species of Punctelia by Hildur Krog when she circumscribed the new genus in 1982. Punctelia borreri is used as a component of traditional Chinese medicine. The lichen has been shown to harbour other organisms, including endophytic fungi and lichenicolous fungi.", "The lichen was first formally described as Lichen borreri by English botanist James Edward Smith in the 25th volume of his work English Botany, published in 1807. The first scientific collections of the lichen were made by another English botanist, William Borrer, whose name is honoured in the species epithet borreri. The type locality was Sussex, where Borrer noted the lichen to be \"not uncommon on the trunks of trees, especially on fruit trees\". Smith described the specific characteristics of the new species as follows: \"Leafy, slightly imbricated, tawny grey, even, sprinkled with white powdery warts; its segments sinuated, rounded at the ends: brown and fibrous beneath. Shields bright chesnut.\" Smith suggested that it had been overlooked by botanists until that time, who might have mistaken it for the common and widespread Parmelia saxatilis. The type specimen collected by Borrer is now part of the lichen collection at the Natural History Museum in London."]}]}}
