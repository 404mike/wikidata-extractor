M. W. Turner. \nFinberg was educated at City of London College, Kings College London and the Lambeth School of Art. In 1905, Finberg was commissioned to catalogue and organise the paintings in the Turner Bequest. His work rediscovered numerous previously unknown Turner canvases which led to Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen to build a new wing devoted to Turner at the Tate Britain. His resulting publication of the Complete Inventory of the Drawings of the Turner Bequest in 1909 is still widely used by contemporary scholars and students. In 1911 he co-founded the Walpole Society.", "link_mentions": {}}}
