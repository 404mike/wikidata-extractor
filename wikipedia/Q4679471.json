An outside-left, he was an integral part of the Celtic team of the 1920s. He provided many assists to Jimmy McGrory, the greatest British goalscorer of all time. In August 1928, after a dispute over terms, he departed Celtic Park with a great amount of hesitation for Sunderland before returning north again with Aberdeen. During the 1933 close season he was transferred to Partick Thistle.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
