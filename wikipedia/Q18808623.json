He thus became Darlington's first substitute since their use was permitted at the start of the season. He was a member of the Darlington team that beat a Blackpool team containing four England internationals, including full-back Jimmy Armfield, in the third round of the 1965\u201366 League Cup away from home. According to the Journal, he \"had particularly bad luck with two drives, one of which hit the bar from  and the other England international goalkeeper Tony Waiters did well to palm away\". He had better luck with a third: after it \"hammered the crossbar\", Bill Hopper equalised from the rebound, before George McGeachie's goal eliminated the First Division side. The next day's report in the Northern Echo told how Johnstone had \"time and again led Armfield a merry dance\". quoted in  He scored his first goal for Darlington on 25 September, and had seven by the end of October. Although his goalscoring dried up, he finished with nine goals from 25 appearances as Lol Morgan led Darlington to runners-up spot in the 1965\u201366 Fourth Division, which gave them their first promotion since the 1920s. Morgan was replaced over the close season by Jimmy Greenhalgh, and Johnstone played in the first two matches of the following season before himself leaving the club."]}]}}
