She became the first female cabinet minister, and the first woman to be a privy counsellor in the UK, when she was appointed Minister of Labour in the Labour government of 1929\u201331. She had earlier become the first woman to chair the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).\nBondfield was born in humble circumstances and received limited formal education. After serving an apprenticeship to an embroidress she worked as a shop assistant in Brighton and London. She was shocked by the working conditions of shop staff, particularly within the \"living-in\" system, and became an active member of the shopworkers' union. She began to move in socialist circles, and in 1898 was appointed assistant secretary of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks (NAUSAWC). She was later prominent in several women's socialist movements: she helped to found the Women's Labour League (WLL) in 1906, and was chair of the Adult Suffrage Society. Her standpoint on women's suffrage\u2014she favoured extending the vote to all adults regardless of gender or property, rather than the limited \"on the same terms as men\" agenda pursued by the militant suffragists\u2014divided her from the militant leadership.\nAfter leaving her union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising secretary for the WLL and later as women's officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She was elected to the TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority Labour government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929\u201331 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second Labour government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefits alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow Ramsay MacDonald into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931. Bondfield remained active in NUGMW affairs until 1938, and during the Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 8", "response": ["*1929 \u2013 Margaret Bondfield is appointed Minister of Labour.

Bevan gained more than twice the votes of Liberal candidate William Griffiths, receiving 20,000 votes to Griffiths' 8,000. In keeping with his background, Bevan described his initial thoughts on the House of Commons as a shrine to \"the most conservative of all religions \u2013 ancestor worship\".

This brought her new contacts, who would typically meet at Fabian summer schools to hear lectures by ILP leaders such as Ramsay MacDonald and Arthur Henderson, and trade union activists such as Ben Tillett and Margaret Bondfield.  Amid these distractions she continued to study hard, and won several prizes. In the summer of 1913 she sat her finals and was awarded her BA degree\u2014not the First Class honours that her tutors had predicted, but an Upper Second. Wilkinson rationalised thus: \"I deliberately  sacrificed my First\u00a0... to devote my spare time to a strike raging in Manchester\".Cole 1938, p. 67.", "Throughout her career Wilkinson was an opponent of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru.Bartley, p. 83. In 1927 she was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy.Bartley, p. 45. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office\u2014ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence.Webb, p. 133. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'.Perry, pp. 88\u201389. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over.Bartley, p. the 34. During the debate she said: \"[W]e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country\u00a0... just as we have [previously] opened the door to the older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build\".", "In May 1929 Baldwin called a general election. As a member of Labour's National Executive, Wilkinson helped to draft her party's manifesto, although her preference for a list of specific policy proposals was overruled in favour of a lengthy statement of ideals and objectives.Bartley, p. 47.Marquand, pp. 477\u201379. In Middlesbrough she was re-elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents. Overall, Labour emerged from the election as the largest party, with 288 members (nine of whom were women), while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively. MacDonald formed his second minority administration, and included two women in ministerial posts: Margaret Bondfield as Minister of Labour and Susan Lawrence as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Ministry of Health. Wilkinson was not given office, but was made Lawrence's Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS), an indication that she was marked for future promotion.Bartley, p. 48.Vernon, p. 102.", "The discipline of working in a ministerial post, together with the influence of Morrison and her alienation from communism, turned Wilkinson away from many of her former left-wing stances. She supported Morrison's decision in January 1941 to suppress the communist newspaper The Daily Worker on the grounds of its anti-British propaganda, and voted for the wartime legislation that banned strikes in key industries. Now accepted within the mainstream of the Labour Party, she served on several key policy committees, and in June 1943 became vice-chairman of the party's National Executive.  She succeeded to the chair when the incumbent, George Ridley, died in January 1944.Vernon, p. 195. In the 1945 New Year Honours she was appointed a Privy Counsellor, only the third woman (after Margaret Bondfield and Lady Astor) to receive this honour.Bartley, pp. 112\u201313.Vernon, p. 194. In April 1945, she was part of a parliamentary delegation that travelled to San Francisco to begin work on the establishment of the United Nations.Bartley, p. 116.", "Wilkinson was the second woman, after Margaret Bondfield, to achieve a place in the British cabinet. As Minister of Education she saw as her main task the implementation of the 1944 Education Act passed by the wartime coalition.Bartley, pp. 123\u201324. This Act provided universal free secondary education, and raised the minimum school leaving age from 14 to 15 with effect from 1947. It said nothing about how secondary education should be organised; Labour's education specialist, James Chuter Ede, who had put the Act through Parliament along with Rab Butler, felt this should be decided at a local authority level.  Many experts felt that children should take an examination \u2014 the \"11-plus\" \u2014 which would determine whether their secondary education would be in a grammar (academic), technical or \"modern\" school. However, many in the Labour Party saw this tripartite arrangement as perpetuating elitism, and wanted a scheme based on \"multilateral\" schools, or what later became known as the \"comprehensive\" system (Chuter Ede preferred this). The system envisaged large schools under a single roof, each with a range of appropriate courses of study for different levels of ability, and flexible movement between courses as children's aptitudes changed.Vernon, p. 203. Wilkinson believed, however, that such a major reconstruction was unachievable at that time, and limited herself to more attainable reforms. Her cautious attitude disappointed and angered some of the Labour left wing and teacher' representatives, who considered that a great opportunity to incorporate socialist principles into education had been missed. Wilkinson, however, was persuaded to the view that selection at 11 would allow all those with higher IQs, irrespective of class background, to obtain a grammar school education.Perry, pp. 376\u2013378."]}, {"page": "Dunkery Hill", "response": ["In 1918 Sir Thomas Acland granted to the National Trust a 500-year lease of a large part of the Holnicote Estate, including Dunkery Hill.

She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase; the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument. The beacon itself, and  of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further  of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead.

Frustrated by the government's economic orthodoxy (a controversial policy upheld by the fiscally conservative Chancellor, Philip Snowden), Mosley submitted an ambitious set of proposals for dealing with the crisis to the Labour Cabinet in what became known as \"Mosley's Memorandum\". These included much greater use of credit to finance development through the public control of banking, rationalisation of industry under public ownership, British agricultural development, import restrictions and bulk purchase agreements with foreign (particularly Imperial) producers, protection of the home market by tariffs, and higher pensions and allowances to encourage earlier retirement from industry and to increase purchasing power. Although Macdonald was sympathetic to some of Mosley's proposals, they were rejected by Snowden and other members of the Cabinet, which led Mosley to resign in frustration in May 1930. The government continued to adhere to an orthodox economic course, as characterised by the controversial decision of the Minister of Labour Margaret Bondfield to push through Parliament an Anomalies Act, aimed at stamping out apparent \"abuses\" of the unemployment insurance system. This legislation limited the rights of short-time, casual and seasonal workers and of married women to claim unemployment benefit, which further damaged the reputation of the government amongst Labour supporters.Labour Inside the Gate: A History of the British Labour Party between the Wars by Matthew Worley Bondfield was caught between the financial orthodoxy of Snowden, the critics of cuts on Labour's backbenches and the baying for even more cuts on the Opposition benches, and in the end she ended up satisfying none of them.Tony Judge Margaret Bondfield: First Woman in the Cabinet (2018)", "* Margaret Bondfield \u2013 Minister of Labour", "| Margaret Bondfield"]}, {"page": "Reading (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Labour: Margaret BondfieldReport of the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, 1939"]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Margaret Bondfield (1873\u20131953) \u2013 politician, chair of the Adult Suffrage Society, first woman Cabinet minister in the United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Labour Club", "response": ["CULC attracted a wide array of prominent speakers.
