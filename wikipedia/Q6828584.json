The two men formed a romantic relationship that was to last for 36 years. The couple lived and worked together quite openly, until Benthall's death at age 55 in 1974.\nHis first connection with the Old Vic was during the 1944 season when the company, owing to enemy action, had been forced to relocate to the New Theatre (now the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre) where Benthall directed a production of Hamlet jointly with Tyrone Guthrie. Benthall provided the scenario for two ballets by Arthur Bliss: Miracle in the Gorbals (1944), and Adam Zero (1946). He was the artistic director of the Old Vic between 1953 and 1962, and produced all of the Shakespeare plays in the First Folio over five years.A few years later, he directed I'm Solomon, a musical remake of an Israeli musical called King Solomon and Shalmai the Shoemaker (\"Shlomo ha'Melech ve'Shalmai ha'Sandlar\") that ran in Jaffa in the Summer of 1967. I'm Solomon starred Dick Shawn, Salome Jens and Carmen Mathews. Ernest Gold, who had written the score for the movie Exodus (1960), wrote the music. Geoffrey Holder choreographed the show. Benthall then directed Coco starring Katharine Hepburn with music by Andr\u00e9 Previn and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner. Michael Bennet choreographed the show. Benthall then directed Her First Roman, a musical version of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra starring Leslie Uggams and Richard Kiley.\nBenthall was a close friend of Vivien Leigh for many years.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
