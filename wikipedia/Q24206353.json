He then moved to Liverpool, but didn't play a match for their senior team. He had a successful stint with Johannesburg Ramblers before playing a final season (1961\u201362) in England with Derby County F.C. during which he made 18 appearances and scored 6 goals.After this, Palmer moved to Australia and played two seasons with Port Melbourne Slavia in the Victorian State League.

Their qualifying campaign started off well, with a goal from Roy Vernon proving the difference in a 1\u20130 win over Czechoslovakia in Cardiff, but a 2\u20131 loss to East Germany in Leipzig and a 2\u20130 defeat to Czechoslovakia left Wales bottom of the group going into the final match at home to East Germany on 25 September 1957. Goals from Des Palmer and Cliff Jones gave Wales a 3\u20130 lead going into the half-time break; Manfred Kaiser pulled one back for the East Germans, but it proved to be too great a margin to overcome, and Palmer completed his hat-trick to give Wales a 4\u20131 win and put them level on points with Czechoslovakia at the top of the group. A win for East Germany over Czechoslovakia by the right scoreline the following month would see Wales qualify for their first World Cup as group winners.

The FAW were still reluctant to call-up replacements and only an outcry from the press prompted Ray Daniel and Des Palmer to join up with the side. Nevertheless, Wales lost the match 2\u20130 which made qualification unobtainable. In the final group match, Palmer scored a hat-trick to defeat East Germany 4\u20131. A second opportunity at qualification emerged in December 1957 as the volatile political situation in Israel led to Turkey, Indonesia and Sudan withdrawing from matches against the nation for varying reasons. FIFA rules decreed that no team could qualify for a World Cup without playing a match, and so a play-off against a European qualifying group runner-up was arranged. Belgium was drawn first but also refused to play Israel leading to a second draw in which Wales were selected. The FAW accepted the offer and Wales travelled to Tel Aviv for the first leg, winning 2\u20130 after goals from Ivor Allchurch and Dave Bowen. The result was the first time Wales had won an international fixture outside Britain. Allchurch scored again in the second leg and a further goal from Cliff Jones secured Wales' first qualification to a major international tournament.", "In the group stage of the tournament, Wales were drawn alongside Mexico, Hungary and hosts Sweden. The side's preparations for the tournament were hampered by confusion over the availability of John Charles; having failed to qualify, the Italian Football Federation had instead organised a club tournament featuring Charles' side Juventus who were reluctant to release the player. Wales manager Jimmy Murphy prepared his team to play without Charles, but the player eventually secured his release and arrived in Sweden only three days before the start of the competition. The side was further weakened by the omission of Trevor Ford, the nation's record goalscorer. He had been banned from playing in Britain in 1956 after he revealed an illegal payments scandal in club football in his autobiography. Despite continuing to play abroad, he was overlooked for selection. Derek Tapscott had also fallen out with the FAW while Des Palmer missed out due to injury, leading to Colin Webster being selected in their stead.
