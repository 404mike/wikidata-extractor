His injury was reflected in the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. To help Shearer get over the injury, club physiotherapist Paul Ferris devised unorthodox methods. At the club's training ground at Durham University, Ferris stacked six school benches and placed Shearer on top with high-jump mats either side \u2013 the striker trying to improve his balance by standing on one leg and bending over to pick up coins while having objects thrown at him, while a crowd of student onlookers watched on. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2\u20130 to Arsenal.", "Shearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias. In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that \"the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me\". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters. Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder."]}, {"page": "Paul Ferris", "response": ["Paul Ferris may refer to:", "* Paul Ferris (composer) (1941\u20131995), English film composer", "* Paul Ferris (footballer) (born 1965), Northern Irish former footballer and now physiotherapist", "* Paul Ferris (Scottish writer) (born 1963), Scottish writer and criminal", "* Paul Ferris (Welsh writer) (1929\u20132018), Welsh biographer and novelist"]}, {"page": "Graham Wylie", "response": ["Speedflex (Europe) Ltd was formed in 2011 by chairman Wylie, Paul Ferris and Alan Shearer."]}, {"page": "Paul Ferris (physio)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Ferris (footballer)"]}]}}
