Antrim's use of the short puck-out strategy was not proving a success with the Saffrons particularly caught in the 20th minute, as Davy O'Halloran controlled possession from Ger Dixon's puck-out and fired the reigning champions to a 0-13 to 0-2 lead. O'Halloran fired Clare's opening goal in the 23rd minute. Further points were added before Shane O'Donnell's 27th-minute goal gave Clare a 2-16 to 0-3 lead.
