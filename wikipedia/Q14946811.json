Abercrombie's batting style is unknown.\nWhile attending the Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, Abercrombie made a single first-class cricket appearance for Cambridge University in The University Match against Oxford University at Lord's in 1838. He was absent injured in Cambridge University's first-innings, but did return for their second-innings, where he was dismissed for a duck by Alfred Lowth. The fixture was won by Oxford University by 98 runs.Prior to Cambridge Abercrombie, attended Tonbridge School.\nHe died at Roxeth, Middlesex on 20 August 1892.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tonbridge School", "response": ["Knox retired in 1812, and was succeeded by his younger son, Thomas. The period of Knox's headmastership was one of national economic and political change, but at the school the greatest change was the increasing importance of cricket. John Abercrombie was the school's first cricket blue (for Cambridge) in 1839. In 1818, a nationwide commission visited Tonbridge to investigate on behalf of the reforming government. Over the next few years, a new scheme for the school was prepared and approved by the Lord Chancellor. New buildings were agreed upon by the governors, and a new dining room and dormitories were built. The school also bought the Georgian building on the High Street to the north of the new junior school, and it was renamed Judde House. This was the school's second boarding house, with the original buildings serving to house boys of the larger School House. In 1826, the governors bought the field which now contains the Head cricket ground, and the patches to the north and south of it, later to be called the Upper and Lower Hundreds. In 1838, Knox took the decision to level the Head, a considerable project, using labour and earth from the new railway workings in the town. The labourers often engaged in fights with the boys, as they were lodged nearby. The Head became the focal point of the school and was regarded as one of the most beautiful cricket grounds in the south of England. Thomas Knox died shortly after the completion of his cricket pitch, in 1834, whilst preparing to preach in the parish church. His death brought to an end the 71-year reign of the Knox family."]}, {"page": "John Abercrombie", "response": ["John Abercrombie or Abercromby may refer to:", "*John Abercrombie (guitarist) (1944\u20132017), American jazz guitarist", "*John Abercrombie (congressman) (1866\u20131940), President of the University of Alabama and United States Representative from Alabama", "*John Abercrombie (cricketer) (1817\u20131892), English cricketer", "*John Abercrombie (physician) (1780\u20131844), Scottish physician and philosopher ", "*John Abercrombie (horticulturalist) (1726\u20131806), Scottish horticulturalist and writer"]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* John Abercrombie, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|John Abercrombie"]}]}}
