Historian Perry Miller wrote that the Puritans \"liberated men from the treadmill of indulgences and penances, but cast them on the iron couch of introspection\". It was expected that conversion would be followed by sanctification\u2014\"the progressive growth in the saint's ability to better perceive and seek God's will, and thus to lead a holy life\". Some Puritans attempted to find assurance of their faith by keeping detailed records of their behavior and looking for the evidence of salvation in their lives. Puritan clergy wrote many spiritual guides to help their parishioners pursue personal piety and sanctification. These included Arthur Dent's The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven (1601), Richard Rogers's Seven Treatises (1603), Henry Scudder's Christian's Daily Walk (1627) and Richard Sibbes's The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax (1630)."]}, {"page": "John Bunyan", "response": ["Within two years of leaving the army, Bunyan married.
