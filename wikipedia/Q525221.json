Hardeep Singh Kohli initially voltuneered to lead the men, but after half an hour the other men began complaining about his overly autocratic leadership style, and when Kelvin MacKenzie off-handedly told him that \"You're not flamin' Hitler,\" Hardeep flew into a rage, demanded that filming be stopped and threatened to walk off the show.
