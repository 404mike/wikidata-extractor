Three days later, on 5 February, Stevenage secured their first home win since October, beating Notts County 2\u20130 at Broadhall Way. Loanee Sam Hoskins gave Stevenage the lead inside the first minute, finishing calmly after Filipe Morais' shot had deflected into his path. Substitute Marcus Haber headed in a Morais cross in the final minute to give Stevenage a two-goal cushion. The team then made the long journey north to face Carlisle United on 9 February, losing the match 2\u20131. Carlisle were two goals to the good within the first fourteen minutes.

A third straight defeat followed a week later, with Stevenage losing 2\u20131 at home to Oldham Athletic.

However, Oldham fought back with second-half goals from Dean Furman and James Tarkowski, taking all three points and inflicting Stevenage's eighth defeat in ten matches. Another defeat followed four days later, on 23 February, this time a 2\u20131 loss to Shrewsbury Town at New Meadow. Similarly to their previous match against Oldham, James Dunne gave Stevenage the lead in the first-half. Shrewsbury equalised on the half hour mark, before scoring late-on to secure all three points.
