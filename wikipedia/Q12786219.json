He also played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland and Cornwall. An adaptable cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a wicket-keeper, but when he moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive batsman who bowled at medium-pace when needed.\nBurns started his cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He struggled to break into the first team with his new county, and spent most of his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.\nFor Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season twice, and was part of the team which won the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. He provided Somerset with a batting all-rounder, particularly in one-day cricket in which he averaged 27 with the bat and 30 with the ball for the county. He took over as Somerset captain in 2003, primarily due to the lack of other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with being sacked. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by Graeme Smith, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an umpire, and was promoted to the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) reserve list in 2012.\nIn January 2016 Burns was promoted to the full list of the ECB's umpiring list.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Burns", "response": ["Mick, Micky, Mickey, Mike or Michael Burns may refer to:", "*Michael Burns (actor) (born 1947), American performer during 1960s and 1970s; later historian and academic", "*Michael Burns (executive) (born 1958), American vice chairman of Lionsgate", "*Michael Burns (Tennessee politician) (1813\u20131896), Irish-born American banker and businessman", "*Michael Burns (Gaelic footballer) (1961\u20132015), Irish Gaelic midfielder", "*Michael Burns (footballer) (born 1988), English midfielder", "*Michael Burns (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1979), New Zealand cricketer"]}]}}
