Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University. Zipperstein earned his B.A. and Ph.D. at the University of California at Los Angeles.\nIn 1993 Zipperstein accepted an invitation to teach Jewish Studies for a semester at the Russian State University for the Humanities, Russia's main center for Archival Studies in Moscow.In 2020 Zipperstein published a newly discovered document in which Mohammed Ali Tewfik, Regent of Egypt during the minority of Farouk of Egypt, responded to the 1929 Palestine riots at Jerusalem's Western Wall by proposing that \"instead of fighting or dealing unjustly by one party or the other, it would be infinitely better to come to an understanding. The Mohametans may be willing to accept a sum of money which would help them to do good for the community and as the Jews are rich, if this thing (the Wailing Wall) is so much desired by them, there seems no reason why they should not pay for it. If this could be done, it would avoid coercion and possibly injustice to one or other of the parties... Let them give \u00a3100,000 and I feel sure this would settle the difference.\"", "link_mentions": []}}
