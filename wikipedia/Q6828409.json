According to Michael Banton (2008), this statement broke more clearly with the notion of race-as-species than the previous two statements, declaring that almost any genetically differentiated population could be defined as a race. The statement stated that \"Different classifications of mankind into major stocks, and of those into more restricted categories (races, which are groups of populations, or single populations) have been proposed on the basis of hereditary physical traits. Nearly all classifications recognise at least three major stocks\" and \"There is no national, religious, geographic, linguistic or cultural group which constitutes a race ipso facto; the concept of race is purely biological.\" It concluded with \"The biological data given above stand in open contradiction to the tenets of racism. Racist theories can in no way pretend to have any scientific foundation.\""]}, {"page": "Clifford Geertz", "response": ["*1966. \"Religion as a Cultural System.\" Pp.\u00a01\u201346 in Anthropological Approaches to the Study of Religion, edited by Michael Banton.

Grady H. Nunn, reviewing it in The Journal of Politics, described the book's scope as \"awesomely unconventional\". In his review in International Affairs, Michael Banton described the book as unduly idealistic and \"too personal\" to generate in the reader \"the kind of theoretical understanding which, by its ability to generate good hypotheses, stimulates self-sustaining advance.\" Tom Woodhouse described the book's \"focus on relationships as the subject of peace\" as that \"which above all distinguishes and characterises\" Curle's work."]}]}}
