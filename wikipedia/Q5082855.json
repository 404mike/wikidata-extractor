He also played at minor counties level for Hertfordshire, and later still stood as a first-class umpire in both England and South Africa. Tarbox's career statistics were fairly modest, but as his obituary in Wisden noted, he frequently chipped in with a few useful runs or wickets, valuable commodities for the generally weak Worcestershire sides of the day.He achieved his best innings figures in his first season of 1921, in only the seventh match of his first-class career, when in June he claimed 7\u201355 against Somerset at Worcester.\nA few weeks later, and against the same opponents, he achieved what was to prove his only ten-wicket match haul, picking up 4\u2013126 and then 6\u201332 in a big Worcestershire victory at Taunton.\nHe ended 1921 with 629 runs at 17.97 and 47 wickets at 27.29.\nWisden said that Tarbox \"never fulfilled the promise\" of that first season.\nHowever, he continued to put in useful performances and was generally a regular in the team. His most productive seasons with the ball were 1927 and 1928, when he took 81 and 79 wickets respectively.\nAs a batsman, the highlights were the only two centuries of his career: 103 not out against local rivals Warwickshire at Edgbaston in May 1925,\nand 109 \u2013 in an innings in which the second highest score was 29 \u2013 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in July 1927.The 1929 season was a very poor one for Tarbox \u2013 he averaged under 12 with the bat and over 42 with the ball \u2013 and Worcestershire released him at the end of the summer.\nThat was the end of his first-class playing career, but he returned to his home county of Hertfordshire and played for them for several years in the Minor Counties Championship; for them he scored relatively few runs but took many wickets, including 6\u201313 against Berkshire in July 1931.After his last game for Hertfordshire in 1934, Tarbox became an umpire, and stood in over 150 English first-class games between 1936 and 1947. He then added another ten matches as an umpire in South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cecil Ponsonby", "response": ["He was to play only one more first-class match, against Nottinghamshire in late August 1928. This was a chastening year for Worcestershire: in 30 County Championship matches they won not a single game, and against a Nottinghamshire side containing Larwood, Voce and Staples they were thrashed by an innings and 21 runs. Ponsonby made a pair, but he did manage one final dismissal when he caught Notts' opener George Gunn off the bowling of Charles Tarbox."]}, {"page": "Tarbox (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Tarbox (1891\u20131978), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Tarbox, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Tarbox"]}]}}
