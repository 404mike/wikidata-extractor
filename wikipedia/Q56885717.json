A greater part of her books dealt with the lives and reminiscences of the British landed gentry of Yorkshire. She was the founder of the De Morgan Centre for the Study of 19th Century Art and Society.

Her mother was a granddaughter of Thomas William Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester. Stirling's parents married in 1853.

The painter John Roddam Spencer Stanhope was her maternal uncle. The Pickering siblings had a special relationship with their nanny which lasted until her death: Jane Hales was portrayed by Evelyn de Morgan as early as 1866, and later lived with Wilhelmina Stirling until her death in 1925, since she had never married herself. ", "Stirling wrote her first novel as a child, The Adventures of Prince Almero: A Tale of the Wind-Spirit, for the entertainment of her cousins. After a revision it was later published in 1890. In honor of her father she wrote her first works under the male alias Percival Pickering. Stirling was only 25 years old at the time. Her novel A life Awry was published in 1893 and performed as a play in 1899. Her writing was not all fictional, a greater part of her publications dealt with the English landed gentry, her mother's ancestors, and artists she knew, including her sister Evelyn and brother-in-law William De Morgan. She is considered the author of more than 30 novels and historical reports. Her writings are a uniquely valuable if sometimes questionable source of biographical information.
