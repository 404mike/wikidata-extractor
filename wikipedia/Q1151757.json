After regaining fitness, Arca made his return to the first team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1\u20130 win over Everton on 14 October 2006. With the progress of Andrew Taylor at left-back, Arca had been utilised as central midfielder. He scored his first goal for the club against Charlton Athletic on 23 December 2006. Arca then scored against Charlton Athletic for the second time this season, in a 3\u20131 win.

Before the end of the campaign, Brown received two foul challenges in which the perpetrator appeared to deliberately stamp on his groin area: Andrew Davies of Ross County was ordered off at the time, with Brown stating \"I didn't want more kids anyway\" but later adding that \"Stamping on opponents when the ball is nowhere near you is definitely not being a hard man or going into a hard tackle\"; the referee took no action against Steven Naismith of Hearts at the time, but the Scotland forward was later banned by the SFA. On the latter incident, Brown commented \"I think they try to wind me up and get me sent off but let's be honest, I am past that stage and have matured eventually.
