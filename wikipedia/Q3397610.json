During the summer and throughout the season some of the most influential players of the previous campaign left Nene Park, including Lee Tomlin, Mark Byrne, Jamie Stuart, Andrew Lawton and Paul Terry. Because of these losses the Diamonds struggled to make a serious play-off push, and by mid-April were 10th in the table, some thirteen points off a promotion spot. Disappointing runs in the FA Cup, FA Trophy and Hillier Cup did little to consolidate the campaign."]}, {"page": "Leon Knight", "response": ["Knight signed for Rushden & Diamonds on a three-year contract on 24 August 2008. but was transfer listed on 29 October, along with Lee Tomlin, Curtis Woodhouse, Andy Burgess, Phil Gulliver, Sagi Burton, Lee Phillips and Dean McDonald, after the club's poor start to the season. On 12 December, Rushden & Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden & Diamonds retained the player's registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless \u00a330,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009\u201310 season, but Rushden & Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year."]}, {"page": "England national football C team", "response": ["|Paul Brown, Lee Tomlin, Sean Newton, Shaun Densmore"]}, {"page": "Jamie Ward", "response": ["On 31 January 2018, Ward joined Cardiff City on loan for the remainder of the 2017\u201318 season in a swap deal involving Lee Tomlin moving to Forest on loan.

The game ended 2\u20131 to Southampton after a brace of goals from Rickie Lambert, including a final-minute winner, reversed the initial Exeter lead. Daniel Nardiello opened the scoring for the home side just before half time, and it took until 20 minutes before the end for the visitors to come back, when Lambert headed in a cross from new signing Dany N'Guessan to equalise. Lambert doubled his tally in the last minute of normal time, heading in another cross this time from returning midfielder Dean Hammond. On 5 February Southampton dropped two points in the return match against Peterborough United, sharing the spoils in an eight-goal thriller. The visitors started off the game well, going 2\u20130 up within half an hour following a Richard Chaplow goal and a Rickie Lambert penalty, but in the last six minutes of the first half Peterborough equalised with strikes from Craig Mackail-Smith and Chris Whelpdale. Lambert scored a second penalty just after the break to extend his lead as the club's top scorer of the season, and returning captain Dean Hammond restored the Saints' two-goal lead just three minutes later. A further two penalties for Peterborough led to a 4\u20134 draw, with the final goal coming from Lee Tomlin in the third minute of injury time at the end of the match. A week later the Saints reduced Huddersfield Town's lead in 3rd place of the table when they defeated Carlisle United 1\u20130 at home in a relatively uneventful game. The game was initially brought alive within the last five minutes of the first half, when Carlisle defender Gary Borrowdale was sent off after receiving a second booking for arguing with the assistant referee, after which Rickie Lambert scored his 50th Southampton goal by heading in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. In the second half, further chances were limited and Southampton nervously picked up three points while Huddersfield played out a goalless draw with Oldham Athletic meaning Southampton could go ahead of Huddersfield should they win their game-in-hand. Southampton remained fifth with several games in hand over Peterborough, Huddersfield and Bournemouth after drawing 0\u20130 with Hartlepool United on 22 February. Southampton upheld their unbeaten league run at the weekend, beating Swindon Town 4\u20131 at home in a convincing performance marked by only five minutes of Swindon dominance in the second half. Adam Lallana opened the scoring for the home side after just 15 minutes, and chances for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado could have increased the scoreline going into half-time. In the second half, winger Matt Ritchie equalised for Swindon, but his effort was cancelled out within minutes when Rickie Lambert and Radhi Ja\u00efdi both scored from set pieces within two minutes of one another to make it 3\u20131. With more chances for Saints in the later stages of the game, substitute Lee Barnard eventually confirmed the win for Southampton with a goal in stoppage time."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Peterborough United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Lee Tomlin"]}, {"page": "David Ball (footballer)", "response": ["Ball signed a -year deal for Darren Ferguson's Peterborough United on 31 January 2011 after being bought for an undisclosed transfer fee. He scored five goals in 21 appearances for \"Posh\" in the second half of the 2010\u201311 season, and was a stoppage-time substitute for Lee Tomlin in the League One play-off final as United secured promotion into the Championship with a 3\u20130 victory over Huddersfield Town.", "He was partnered with Tomlin following the sale of Craig Mackail-Smith to Brighton at the start of the 2011\u201312 season. However Ball returned to League One on loan at Rochdale on 31 August after Peterborough signed Emile Sinclair from Macclesfield Town. He scored four goals in eight games for the \"Dale\", which led to him being recalled to London Road on 10 October to compete with Paul Taylor and Emile Sinclair for a starting place in the absence of Nicky Ajose (loaned out) and Lee Tomlin (injured). Ball made just five substitute appearances however, and returned to Rochdale on loan on 24 November. His second loan spell at Rochdale was not as successful as his first spell as he failed to find the net in seven games and manager Steve Eyre was sacked. He was put on the transfer-list at Peterborough in April 2012."]}]}}
