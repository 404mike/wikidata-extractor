The marriage was a very happy one, and they had six children, including Malcolm MacDonald (1901\u201381), who had a distinguished career as a politician, colonial governor and diplomat, and Ishbel MacDonald (1903\u201382), who was very close to her father. Another son, Alister Gladstone MacDonald (1898\u20131993) was a conscientious objector in the First World War, serving in the Friends' Ambulance Unit; he became a prominent architect who worked on promoting the planning policies of his father's government, and specialised in cinema design. MacDonald was devastated by Margaret's death from blood poisoning in 1911, and had few significant personal relationships after that time, apart from with Ishbel, who acted as his consort while he was Prime Minister and cared for him for the rest of his life.
