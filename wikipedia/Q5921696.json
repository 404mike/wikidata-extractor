Despite being opposed by a coalition candidate in Cannock, Rees was a natural supporter of the Lloyd George coalition. He was typical of the backbench Coalition Liberals of the period, many of whom were wealthy industrialists. On the backbenches the party was strongest in terms of bank balances rather than political expertise.Chris Cook, Age of Alignment: Electoral Politics in Britain 1922\u201329; Macmillan, 1975 p15n His wealth, his position in industry, his fierce anti-socialism, all commended him to Conservatives as his nonconformity, his interest in Welsh national movements and his support for free trade made him attractive to Liberals. Bristol was a coalition stronghold, all five seats in the city being represented at the 1918 general election by parties and candidates supporting the coalition. The sitting Liberal MP for Bristol South, Sir William Howell Davies, who had represented the constituency since 1906, was retiring and Rees was selected to replace him. Despite the fall of the Lloyd George coalition following the vote of the Conservative Party at the Carlton Club, the Tories were reluctant to break the electoral arrangements in Bristol which ensured straight fights in all the seats against Labour to the benefit of their candidates and the Conservatives did not oppose Rees in his contest with D J Vaughan, the Labour man. Thus Rees was elected to Parliament at the 1922 general election with a majority of 3,459 votes."]}, {"page": "Pyle RFC", "response": ["* Howell Davies 4 caps"]}, {"page": "William Howell Davies", "response": ["#REDIRECT Howell Davies"]}, {"page": "Howell Davies (rugby)", "response": ["Howell Davies won caps for Wales (RU) while at Neath RFC in 1912 against England, and Scotland."]}, {"page": "Parthian Books", "response": ["*Congratulate the Devil, Howell Davies"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1908", "response": ["|William Howell Davies, MP"]}, {"page": "Statue of Edward Colston", "response": ["Two appeals to Colston-related charitable bodies raised \u00a3407 towards the cost of the statue.
