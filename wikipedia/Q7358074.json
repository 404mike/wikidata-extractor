He is the Philip Wetton Professor of Astrophysics at Oxford University. His research interests centre on cosmology and how galaxies form and evolve. He has a longstanding interest in astronomical instruments and telescopes and developed the scientific case for the UK's involvement in the 8m Gemini telescopes project. He has pioneered the use of a new class of astronomical spectrograph to measure the masses and ages of galaxies, as well as search for black holes in their nuclei. He is the founding Director of the Oxford Centre for Astrophysical Surveys which is funded by the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of knowledge about galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale structure", "response": ["* 1987\u00a0\u2014 David Burstein, Roger Davies, Alan Dressler, Sandra Faber, Donald Lynden-Bell, R.

Opening the project to the general public saved the professional astronomers the task of studying all the galaxies themselves, resulting in classification of a large number of galaxies undertaken in a shorter time than what smaller research teams would be able to do, classifying 900,000 galaxies in months rather than years if done by smaller research teams. Computer programs had been unable to reliably classify galaxies: several groups had attempted to develop image-analysis programs. Kevin Schawinski stated: \"The human brain is actually much better than a computer at these pattern recognition tasks.\" However, volunteers astonished the project's organizers by classifying the entire catalog years ahead of schedule. An online forum was later set up two weeks after the initial start, partially due to a large volume of emails being sent around, to the point that it was troublesome for those receiving them to process and respond to them. This led volunteers to point out anomalies that on closer inspection have turned out to be new astronomical objects such as 'Hanny's Voorwerp' and 'the Green Pea galaxies'. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed by what they\u2019ve managed to achieve,\u201d says University of Oxford astronomer Roger Davies, former president of the Royal Astronomical Society.\u201cThey\u2019ve made it possible to do things with a huge survey.\u201d", "The Galaxy Zoo forum became a hotbed for the discussion of the SDSS images and more general science questions. Its 'global moderator', UK teacher Alice Sheppard, said of it: \"I don't quite know what it is, but Galaxy Zoo does something to people. The contributions, both creative and academic, that people have made to the forum are as stunning as the sight of any spiral, and never fail to move me.\" Author Michael Nielsen wrote in his book Reinventing Discovery: \"But Galaxy Zoo can go beyond computers, because it can also apply human intelligence in the analysis, the kind of intelligence that recognizes that Hanny's Voorwerp or a Pea galaxy is out of the ordinary, and deserves further investigation. Galaxy Zoo is thus a hybrid, able to do deep analyses of large data sets that are impossible in any other way.\" A community feeling was also created. Roger Davies stated: \"The community of Galaxy Zoo gives them the opportunity to participate that they\u2019re looking for.\u201d This community became known as the 'Zooites'. Aida Berges, a homemaker living in Puerto Rico who has classified hundreds of thousands of galaxies, stated: \"Every galaxy has a story to tell. They are beautiful, mysterious, and show how amazing our universe is. It was love at first sight when I started in Galaxy Zoo ... It is a magical place, and it feels like coming home at last.\" The Galaxy Zoo Forum became a read-only archive in July 2014.
