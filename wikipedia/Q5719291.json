By the 1840s, he was in London, and became a regular performer at the Cyder Cellar in Covent Garden.  His fame rested on one song, \"Sam Hall\", which had originated some years earlier as the story of a habitual criminal.  He performed the song in character as a chimney sweep awaiting execution, \"sitting astride a chair, the effect of his tattered clothes and bedraggled hat increased by the blackened clay pipe held between his teeth, which was removed only for purposes of expectoration, and for the greater emphasis of the oaths which bespatter the verses.\"   The song was notorious for its refrain of \"Damn your eyes!\", sometimes replaced by a stronger expletive.Richard Anthony Baker, British Music Hall: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2014, , pp.4-5 Ross's performances drew large crowds, and were \"unanimously held to possess a degree of power.... for a number of years, a crowded room was assured whenever Ross was announced.\"  The critic W. J. MacQueen-Pope said that \"as a piece of characterisation of its kind, it is doubtful if it was ever excelled,\"  and Henry Chance Newton described Ross as a \"really comic comic singer and splendid character actor..  bringing down the house as he always did with his drolleries\". \"William Gribbon Ross\", ShirlieRoden.com.
