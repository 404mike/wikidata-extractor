The politics of Thebes are inextricably linked with those of its royal family: the rupture between Eteocles and Polynices results in a split within the Theban polity and leads ultimately to civil war. Another aspect of this theme is the dominance of male actors over their female contemporaries which mirrors the patriarchal society of Flavian Rome. Statius shares this concern with his epic predecessor Lucan, whose Bellum civile portrayed the civil war between Pompey and Caesar as failure of their marriage ties."]}, {"page": "Mount Pleasant, Harare", "response": ["* Kathleen Coleman (1975), classicist and professor at Harvard University"]}, {"page": "Agnes Bennett", "response": ["* Kathleen Coleman"]}, {"page": "Mary De Garis", "response": ["* Kathleen Coleman"]}, {"page": "Kathleen M.
