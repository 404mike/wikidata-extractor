The vessels included, besides Invincible, the Type 82 destroyer Bristol; the Type 42 destroyer Newcastle; the Type 22 frigate Battleaxe; the Leander-class frigates Arethusa and Euryalus; Tribal-class frigate Zulu; the Rothesay-class frigate Rhyl; the Oberon-class submarine Otus; the Swiftsure-class submarine Splendid  and the support vessels RFA Olwen and Resource.  A large number of Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, Blackburn Buccaneer and SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft were also sent to RAF Gibraltar to take part.  The exercise was commanded by Rear Admiral Robert Gerken, Flag Officer, Second Flotilla. The Spanish government lodged a diplomatic protest against the exercise and associated ship movements; it was also objected to by the Soviet government who called it provocative.  The British vessels in the exercise were shadowed by two Spanish frigates and a destroyer.  Specific attention was paid during the exercise to anti-submarine warfare with the surface vessels hunting Splendid and Otus.  Anti-aircraft procedures, which proved important during the Falklands War, were also practised against the RAF aircraft.  The exercises were focused on two areas, one  west of Gibraltar (in the Atlantic) and one  east of Gibraltar (in the Mediterranean) and practice missile firings were carried out in both areas.  The British vessels returned to Portsmouth at the completion of the exercise at the end of April."]}]}}
