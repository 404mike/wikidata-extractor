The seat had not been contested in either 1918 or 1922, and in a straight contest with the sitting Conservative MP, Boulton won 46% of the votes. Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat.  The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total. He did not stand for Parliament again.", "link_mentions": {}}}
