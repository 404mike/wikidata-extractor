He was born at Croydon, Surrey and died at Alverstoke, Hampshire.\nA tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, MacDonald Watson was a Royal Navy officer with little time for first-class cricket. He played a single match in 1932 and then three in 1933. In his third game, he took five Derbyshire wickets for just 27 runs in 14 overs in the match at Ilkeston, and these constituted more than half of his first-class haul of eight wickets in his four games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Alastair MacDonald Watson (1932\u20131933) 4 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Alistair MacDonald Watson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alastair MacDonald Watson"]}, {"page": "Alistair MacDonald-Watson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alastair MacDonald Watson"]}, {"page": "Alastair MacDonald-Watson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alastair MacDonald Watson"]}, {"page": "Alastair Watson", "response": ["* Alastair MacDonald Watson (1909\u20131987), English cricketer"]}]}}
