In 1949 he unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative Party parliamentary candidate for St Pancras North.  Shields served on Hampstead Borough Council between 1947 and 1965, serving as deputy leader, and as Chairman of the finance and works committees.\nShields later became an adviser in merger broking, especially in the role of director of Chesham Amalgamations and Investments (1964\u20131984). He was Chairman of the London area of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations (1961\u20131963), and was thrice a member of the Conservative Party National Executive.\nHe was knighted in 1964 for political and public services in London and Hampstead.\nDuring his time as the chairman of the Commission for New Towns (1982\u20131995) Shields oversaw the doubling in the number of new towns under the control of the commission, as all the independent New Town Development Corporations were wound up by 1992, as part of the Conservative Government's proposals under Margaret Thatcher to reduce the number of Quangos.  The commission, under his chairmanship, was converted from a holding body to a disposal agency, selling off billions of pounds of assets.  At the same time Shields also served on the board of London Transport (1986\u20131993), six months doing so as interim Chairman (1988\u201389) after the Fennell report into the King's Cross fire, and afterwards as deputy chairman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English Partnerships", "response": ["*Neil Shields, Chairman of the Commission for New Towns 1982\u20131995"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*12 September \u2013 Neil Shields, politician and businessman (born 1919)"]}, {"page": "London Regional Transport", "response": ["* Sir Neil Shields, 1988\u20131989"]}, {"page": "1919 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 September \u2013 Neil Shields, politician and businessman (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Chesham Amalgamations", "response": ["By 1969, the company had recruited Sir Neil Shields as its third director."]}, {"page": "Sir Neil Shields", "response": ["#REDIRECT Neil Shields"]}, {"page": "List of heads of public transport authorities in London", "response": ["*Sir Neil Shields, 1988\u20131989"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampstead", "response": ["*Sir Neil Shields (British Conservative Party politician and businessman)\"Obituary: Sir Neil Shields\" TimesOnline.co.uk, 1 November 2002 (Retrieved 18 June 2009)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2002", "response": ["*Neil Shields, 83, British politician and businessman."]}, {"page": "Keith Bright", "response": ["In 1987, a major fire at King's Cross Underground station killed 31 people. Following the fire, Bright offered to resign - however Transport Secretary Paul Channon requested Bright to stay as chairman throughout the subsequent public inquiry. During the inquiry, Bright was criticised for suggesting that an arsonist was to blame for the fire. In 1988, the Fennell Report into the fire was published, which revealed serious issues with the safety of the Underground and its management culture. Both Bright and Tony Ridley (Chairman of London Underground) resigned. He was replaced on an caretaker basis by Sir Neil Shields (1988-89), and then by Sir Wilfrid Newton."]}]}}
