In 1950\u201351 Southampton had problems with the goalkeeping position and in all used four different custodians (the others were Eddie Thomas and Len Stansbridge).

He joined Southampton as an amateur in November 1933, and made frequent reserve-team appearances. At the start of the 1936\u201337 season, both regular custodian Bert Scriven and new signing Len Stansbridge were unavailable, so Bernard was drafted into the first team for matches at home to Chesterfield (won 3\u20132) and away to Doncaster Rovers (lost 2\u20130), before Scriven's return."]}, {"page": "Eddie Thomas (footballer, born 1932)", "response": ["He made his reserve team debut on 17 December 1949, displacing Len Stansbridge, and over the next year, he and Stansbridge vied for the role of second choice 'keeper behind Scottish international Ian Black. Black moved to Fulham in July 1950, with Northern Irish international Hugh Kelly joining the Saints in exchange. On 7 October 1950, Kelly was called into the Northern Irish team for a match against England and manager Sid Cann promoted Thomas to the first-team for a match against Birmingham City. At a month before his 18th birthday, Thomas thus became Southampton's youngest-ever first-team goalkeeper, until the debut of Bob Charles in 1959. Although the match was lost 2\u20130, Thomas was not deemed to be at fault for either of the goals."]}, {"page": "Hugh Kelly (footballer, born 1919)", "response": ["By the end of the season, Kelly had fallen out of favour with the Southampton manager, Sid Cann, following disciplinary problems after a match at Leicester in April 1951. After the match, the team stayed in the Midlands to play a friendly match at Boston. Kelly returned to the team hotel with Ken Chisholm of Coventry City and two young ladies. When the Southampton trainer, Jimmy Easson, tried to get the ladies to leave, he and Kelly had an argument which culminated in Kelly giving the trainer a black eye. As a result, Kelly was immediately placed on the transfer-list, with John Christie taking over from him in goal for the last two matches of the season. By now completely out of favour, Kelly was fifth choice 'keeper behind Fred Kiernan, Christie, Len Stansbridge and Eddie Thomas and was unable even to get a match in the reserves, spending the whole of 1951\u201352 on the sidelines, with some time back in Ireland."]}, {"page": "George Ephgrave", "response": ["In March 1939, at the end of the last full season before the Second World War, the goalkeeper signed for Swindon Town, where he made his first appearance in the Football League. During the conflict, Ephgrave served his country in the Royal Marines, resulting in him being captured on Crete and held as a prisoner of war in Odessa, Ukraine for four years. On his return to England he was signed by Southampton, where he was used as the first-choice goalkeeper for the first season after the war. In the 1946\u201347 season he played in 29 of the 42 Second Division league games, as well as in both of the FA Cup games the Saints played, although in the following season he was second choice to Len Stansbridge and, later, Ian Black, making only seven league appearances in the first half of the campaign."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Len Stansbridge, footballer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["The year began poorly for the Saints with three consecutive losses away from home in which the side conceded 11 goals, prompting Dodgin to replace regular goalkeeper George Ephgrave with Len Stansbridge for much of the rest of the season. Through February and March, the team won four out of seven matches to move away from the relegation zone and back up to the top ten, although four straight losses saw them drop back down to 15th in April. Seven players were released by the club near the end of the month. Three wins from their last six matches meant that Southampton finished 14th in the Second Division table, compared to 18th in the last pre-war season.", "!scope=\"row\"|Len Stansbridge"]}]}}
