Following Ty Gooden's centre from the left, the diving Thomson stole in front of Stuart Balmer to glance the ball into the far corner of the net. The goal was reminiscent of Keith Houchen's cup final goal for Coventry City versus Tottenham Hotspur.

Each semi-final was played on a two-legged basis, with one game at each team's home stadium and the result determined based on the aggregate score of the two games. In the first leg of their semi-final away to Stoke, Gillingham conceded two goals in the first eight minutes of the game.  Although Ty Gooden scored for the \"Gills\" after 18 minutes, Stoke extended their lead to 3\u20131 in the second half.  In the fifth minute of stoppage time, Andy Hessenthaler scored a goal for Gillingham, making the final score 3\u20132.  Wigan drew 0\u20130 in the first leg against Millwall, with BBC Sport noting that both teams appeared \"edgy from the outset and perhaps too anxious to impress\".

Striker Iffy Onuora and midfielder Ty Gooden both joined from Swindon Town for a combined transfer fee of \u00a3200,000. It marked the start of a second spell at the club for Onuora, who had played for Gillingham between 1996 and 1998; he was a regular starter for the remainder of the season, with Rowe largely used only as a substitute.  The team's first match of 2000 resulted in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Reading; Thomson gave Gillingham the lead in the 90th minute, but their opponents then equalised in injury time. The next two games both ended in defeat, and a goalless draw away to Chesterfield in the first match of February meant that the team had gone five games without a win.
