Amaya, known as Vixen in the field, was recruited by the Justice Society of America to fight against Axis forces alongside leader Rex Tyler / Hourman, Commander Steel, Obsidian, Stargirl, and Doctor Mid-Nite. At some point, Amaya's enters into a relationship with Rex and when he is murdered, she joins the Legends to find his killer. Amaya is confirmed to be Mari McCabe's grandmother when Ray Palmer, who had previously worked with Mari, warns Nate Heywood about changing Mari's destiny by getting involved with Amaya. Despite defeating Rex's killer and gaining knowledge of her tragic destiny, Amaya decides not to alter time and remains with the Legends for the time being, while also pursuing her relationship with Nate. Season three makes further connections between Amaya and the web series with the introductions of new Legend, Zari Tomaz, and secondary antagonist, Kuasa. Zari, a vigilante from 2042, forms a bond with Amaya due to the former's possession of the air totem of Zambezi. Kuasa, who is Mari's biological sister, enemy, and uneasy ally, has been revived by the season's main antagonist Mallus since her death in the Vixen web series, again in possession of the water totem. Ray, recalling his previous battle with the water-bending villain, confirms to Amaya that Kuasa is indeed her granddaughter. Amaya discovers that her future counterpart wiped her memories as the Legends to preserve Mari's destiny, and realizes that although Mari became a superhero, Kuasa's life was irreparably damaged. Amaya, with the help of her future daughter Esi, saves her village from being destroyed in 1992. The new timeline reflects these changes, with Mari and Kuasa sharing the Anansi Totem.
