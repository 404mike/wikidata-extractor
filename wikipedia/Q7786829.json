He published political pamphlets and broadsides, contributing to the poetry columns of the Black Dwarf and other periodicals.\nRickman married outside the Quaker faith, and after being disowned by the Society of Friends moved to London, where in 1783 he set up as a bookseller. He was a member of the Headstrong Club, and a friend of Thomas Paine, who lived with him when composing The Rights of Man in 1791 - they had first met during the time Paine was living in Lewes between 1768 and 1774.
