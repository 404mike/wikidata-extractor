At Highbury he formed a formidable back line with Tony Adams, Nigel Winterburn and his former Stoke teammate Lee Dixon and ended up with nine major honours to his name. He left the Gunners in 1999 and ended his playing career with Sunderland.Since his playing career has ended Bould has worked at the successful Arsenal Academy as Head Youth Team Coach at Arsenal.

Coincidentally it was Bright who Linighan outjumped to score. Thanks to his goal, Arsenal became the first club in English football to win the Cup Double.
