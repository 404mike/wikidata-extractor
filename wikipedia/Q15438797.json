One song, we was sittin' up there just talkin', me and my granddaughter, and I said, \"Yeah, if you got anything in layaway, you better get it out.\" And I made a song of that\". Also, Bryant's knowledge of early blues in Atlanta and Georgia, was used as a source by the music historians Peter B. Lowry and Bruce Bastin. Her own recording career was late in commencing before Dave Peabody's 1997 album, Down in Carolina, contained a guest appearance from Bryant on her penned track, \"McTell, Moss, & Weaver\"."]}]}}
