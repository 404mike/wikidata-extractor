He remained with the party after being severely wounded twice, but had refused to leave until the general retirement was ordered, and even then he repeatedly went back into the open to carry wounded men to safety. In the latter part of the day, he sprang forward to bring in another wounded man. While carrying the helpless infantryman to the safety of the trench Daniel was seen to stagger. Subsequently, Daniel was found to have been shot a third time, in his right jaw, and, incapacitated, he took no further part in the action.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carrickfergus", "response": ["*Two Victoria Cross recipients, Daniel Cambridge and James Crichton"]}, {"page": "James Crichton (soldier)", "response": ["Several memorials are dedicated to Crichton, including a plaque on the first house in which his family lived in Carrickfergus, his place of birth, in Northern Ireland.
