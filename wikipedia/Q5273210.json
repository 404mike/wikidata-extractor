Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time."]}, {"page": "Dean Park Cricket Ground", "response": ["* Highest individual innings: 316 by Dick Moore for Hampshire v Warwickshire, 1937"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  Dick Moore 1936-1937"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club first-class cricket records", "response": ["* Highest Score: 316 Dick Moore v Warwickshire, Dean Park, Bournemouth 1937"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Dick Moore (1934\u20131938)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Dick Moore (1936\u20131937) : R.
