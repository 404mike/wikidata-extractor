She and Barbara Bush are the only two women to be married to one U.S. president and the mother of another.Adams's life is one of the most documented of the First Ladies: she is remembered for the many letters she wrote to her husband while he stayed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the Continental Congresses.

He previously served as the eighth United States Secretary of State from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and as a member of the United States Senate and House of Representatives representing Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as the second U.S. president from 1797 to 1801, and First Lady Abigail Adams. Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the Whig Party.", "John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to John and Abigail Adams (n\u00e9e Smith) in a part of Braintree, Massachusetts that is now Quincy. He was named for his mother's maternal grandfather, Colonel John Quincy, after whom Quincy, Massachusetts, is named. Young Adams was educated by private tutors \u2013 his cousin James Thaxter and his father's law clerk, Nathan Rice. He soon exhibited literary skills, and in 1779 he started a diary that he kept until just before he died in 1848. Until the age of ten, Adams grew up on the family farm in Braintree, largely in the care of his mother. Though frequently absent because of his participation in the American Revolution, John Adams maintained a correspondence with his son, encouraging him to read works by authors such as Thucydides and Hugo Grotius.. With his father's encouragement, Adams would also translate classical authors such as Virgil, Horace, Plutarch, and Aristotle."]}, {"page": "November 22", "response": ["*1744 \u2013 Abigail Adams, American wife of John Adams, 2nd First Lady of the United States (d. 1818)"]}, {"page": "October 28", "response": ["*1818 \u2013 Abigail Adams, American writer and second First Lady of the United States (b. 1744)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Jefferson", "response": ["thumb|In 1804, Abigail Adams attempted to reconcile Jefferson and Adams.", "Jefferson and John Adams had been good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s.

Roosevelt, claimed that the vice presidency \"isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss\". Harry Truman, who also served as vice president under Roosevelt, said the office was as \"useful as a cow's fifth teat\". Walter Bagehot remarked in The English Constitution that \"[t]he framers of the Constitution expected that the vice-president would be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in the country.
