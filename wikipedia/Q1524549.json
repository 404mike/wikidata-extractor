He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1921 to 1951.Born in Ballina, County Mayo, in 1892. He was educated at St Muredach's College and later at St. Enda's School, Rathfarnham, Dublin, run by Patrick Pearse. After studying at Trinity College, Dublin, he qualified as a solicitor in 1918 and built up a practice in his home town.During the Irish War of Independence he was active in the Irish Republican Army. He was a close friend of Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada, with whom he lived for some time. He also took part in local politics, becoming chair of Ballina Urban Council from 1919 to 1932 and chair of Mayo County Council from 1922 to 1926.\nHe was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 1921 as a Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Mayo North and West. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 and joined the Republican forces and was seriously injured during the Civil War. He was re-elected to the D\u00e1il again in 1923 for Mayo North and in a further ten elections until 1951. In 1926, Ruttledge was a founder-member of Fianna F\u00e1il.\nHe joined the cabinet of \u00c9amon de Valera in 1932, serving as Minister for Lands and Fisheries, Minister for Justice and Minister for Local Government and Public Health, resigning in 1941 for the officially stated reason of \"ill health\". However, it is speculated by some historians that his actual motivation for the resignation was that he morally objected to the execution of IRA members by the Fianna F\u00e1il government. During Ruttledge's tenure as Minister for Justice, he had executed 3 men for IRA activity but commuted the death sentences of 8 other men. His successor, Gerald Boland, was much more severe, executing 14 men (although commuted 12). Boland's tally of 14 executions was the most by any Minister of Justice in the history of the Irish state. Ruttledge continued to work as TD for over a decade after his resignation despite his \"ill health\".\nRuttledge died in 1952 while still a member of the D\u00e1il. He was described by the Irish Times as 'a gentle, kind and upright man'. He married Helena and they had one son Ronan who died young and three daughters. A horsebreeder, he was a member of the Turf Club and won the Irish Derby with Mondragon in 1939.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Mayo", "response": ["Mayo, as all parts of what became the Irish Free State, was affected by the events of the Irish revolutionary period, including the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War. Major John MacBride of Westport was amongst those who took part in the 1916 Easter Rising and was subsequently executed by the British for his participation. His death served as a rallying call for Republicans in Mayo and led to Mayo men such as P. J. Ruttledge, Ernie O'Malley, Michael Kilroy and Thomas Derrig to rise up during the War of Independence. In the ensuing Civil War, many of these leading figures chose the Anti-treaty side and fought in bitter battles such as those in Ballina, which changed hands between pro and anti-treaty forces a number of times.", "* P.
