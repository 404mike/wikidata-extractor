Both studio EPs were recorded by drummer Ben Harris and mixed by the band. EP 2, in particular, was mastered by Donal Whelan at Hafod Mastering.  Less than two months after the release of EP 2, Mark Watson and Ben Harris announced their departure from the band. Winter and Williams (as a duo) decided to promote EP 2 and continued to write and play with the idea of reforming the band. During this time the band were invited to play a night comp\u00e8red by Bethan Elfyn in Buffalo Bar, Cardiff. However, the band had officially disbanded by then with Peter and Gareth obligated to fulfil the booking. This happened to be the last time the two songwriters played on stage together as Gareth Williams soon parted ways.

Speaking about the 2008 chart, singer-songwriter Christopher Rees noted that \"when records are so popular in mainstream charts, they lose favour with the critics. The quirkier the sound, the cooler it becomes in their opinion.\" Similarly, Jonathan Owen of The Independent contrasted the albums that had been featured in 2011's Poll of Polls against those that had sold the most that year in the UK. Although Let England Shake had topped HMV's listing, Owen remarked that \"hardly anyone would agree\", as Harvey's album had, at the time, sold only 130,000\u00a0copies, compared with 3.5\u00a0million copies of the year's best-seller, 21 by Adele."]}, {"page": "Cautionary Tales", "response": ["*Cautionary Tales, an album by Christopher Rees"]}, {"page": "Rees, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Rees"]}]}}
