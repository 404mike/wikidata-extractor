A member of the Labour Party, she has been Member of Parliament for Leeds West since 2010.\nBorn in Lewisham, Reeves studied at New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics before working as an economist at the Bank of England, the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. and HBOS. Elected at the 2010 general election, she served in Ed Miliband's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2011 to 2013 and Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2013 to 2015. As Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Reeves announced Labour would be tougher than the Conservatives in reducing  benefits  for the long-term unemployed and would not seek to represent those out of work.\nReeves did not return to the Shadow Cabinet following Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader in 2015, instead serving as chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee from 2017 to 2020. After Keir Starmer was elected as leader in 2020, he appointed Reeves as Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, shadowing Michael Gove. In May 2021, she replaced Anneliese Dodds as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 13", "response": ["*  1979   \u2013 Rachel Reeves, English economist and politician, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"]}, {"page": "Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor", "response": ["Astor's antisemitism has been widely documented and has been criticised in recent years, particularly in light of former Prime Minister Theresa May's 2019 unveiling of a statue in her honour with current Prime Minister Boris Johnson in attendance, and more recently after Labour MP Rachel Reeves commemorated Astor in a series of tweets.

KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion's last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: \"Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received,\" said MP Rachel Reeves.
