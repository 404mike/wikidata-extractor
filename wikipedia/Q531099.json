The film characterises Lennon and Cynthia's relationship as one that will eventually be doomed by their wanting different things from life but with Lennon not wanting to hurt her.  Cynthia later complained that the film made her out \"as a clingy, dim, little girlfriend in a headscarf\". In another film covering the early years of the pre-fame Beatles, the 1979 Birth of the Beatles, she was portrayed by Wendy Morgan. She was portrayed in 2000 television film In His Life: The John Lennon Story by Gillian Kearney; the negative aspects of John's treatment of her were not overlooked.  Cynthia was subsequently portrayed in the troubled, Ono-centric 2005 American musical Lennon, with her character \u2013 played by Julia Murney \u2013 gaining a little more prominence during one of the show's rewrites.  Her life had a more central role in the 2010 BBC Four film Lennon Naked, with Claudie Blakley playing the part.
