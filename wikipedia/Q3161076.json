It involves the curb rein being held under the pinkie, and the bradoon rein held like a driving rein, between the thumb and first finger. The two reins therefore insert into the hand as far away as they possibly could and allow each set to be used with considerable leverage. Therefore, either rein can be used without the influence of the other, simply by rotating the lower or upper part of the hand back. This hold is commonly seen used (correctly) by the dressage rider Philipe Karl. However, when used incorrectly, which can be extremely easy to do even by excellent riders, it causes the horse to flex at the third vertebra instead of the poll, a major fault."]}, {"page": "Fillis", "response": ["*James Fillis (1834\u20131913), English-born French riding master"]}, {"page": "Phillis", "response": ["* James Fillis"]}, {"page": "Vladimir Littauer", "response": ["Littauer was born in the Ural Mountains of Russia but grew up in St. Petersburg.
