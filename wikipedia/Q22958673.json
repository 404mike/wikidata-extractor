The album, produced by Justin Beckler and self-funded by Butcher, was given four and a half stars from five by Reax Music Magazine, saying, \"Matt Butcher has carved out his own immediately recognizable niche, a dewey-praire [sic] mix of wistfulness and confession executed with a deceptively light touch that only barely suggests the material's substance... and it only gets better with repeated listens.\"", "After the success of his debut album, Matt Butcher and his backing band the Revolvers opened for The Avett Brothers on their Florida tour dates.", "*Matt Butcher (2015)"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["Yeovil's first friendly of the season saw them travel to Southern League Premier side Dorchester Town, on 12 July.
