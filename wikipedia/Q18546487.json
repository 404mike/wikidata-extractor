In fact, Thalberg did not even perform at that concert, but very hastily left. His wife had arrived from Europe, following reports that Thalberg had an extra-marital liaison.On 16 April 1858, in New York, Elena D'Angri had given birth to a child who was suspected to be Thalberg's daughter. The girl was called Zar\u00e9 Thalberg. On 10 April 1875, in the Royal Italian Opera in London, 'Zar\u00e9 Thalberg' made a successful debut as Zerline in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\".See the note in the Allgemeine Zeitung Augsburg 1875, p.1788. It has been suggested however that this girl's real name was Ethel Western and she had been born in England. See: Lott: From Paris to Peoria, p.158. This caused further confusion when the opera singer Zare Thalberg debuted at Covent Garden in 1875. She had been one of his students but she was misidentified as his daughter."]}]}}
