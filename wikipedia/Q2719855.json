He was bassist for the English rock band UFO from 1968 to 1982; Way rejoined the band briefly in 1988\u20131989, and full-time from 1991 to 2008. He was also a founding member of Waysted and Fastway and notably played with Michael Schenker Group and Ozzy Osbourne.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UFO (band)", "response": ["Lead singer Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way and drummer Andy Parker formed the band in 1968. Having originally called themselves Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name in October 1969 to UFO, in honour of the London club where they were spotted by Noel Moore, who signed them to the Beacon Records label, headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their first album, UFO 1, released in 1970, is a typical example of early hard rock; it includes a heavy version of the Eddie Cochran classic \"C'mon Everybody\". Neither their first nor their second album, UFO 2: Flying, was successful, but the song \"Boogie For George\" from the first album reached No. 30 on the German singles chart, and \"Prince Kajuku\" from Flying reached No. 26. At this time UFO attracted little interest in Britain and America. Some of their early work was strongly influenced by space rock (their second album, featuring a 26-minute title track and a 19-minute-long track \"Star Storm\", was subtitled One Hour Space Rock) that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. Mick Bolton left the group in January 1972, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound.", "In February 1982, the band released Mechanix. It was successful in the UK, where it reached No. 8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (former bassist with Eddie and the Hot Rods and the Damned). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.", "This proved to be a short break; just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly afterward, and released Misdemeanor. Raymond left again in 1986 and was replaced by David Jacobson, who along with Gray would leave in 1987, and Pete Way rejoined on bass. Before Gray's departure, the band recorded the EP Ain't Misbehavin which was released in 1988. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, former Starfighters guitarist Rik Sandford and Tony Glidewell  in 1988, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.", "Phil Mogg and Pete Way continued working together throughout this fluctuating band membership, releasing two albums under the Mogg/Way name in the late 1990s, Edge of the World and Chocolate Box.", "In 2000, Schenker rejoined UFO again and the band released the double CD Covenant (with Aynsley Dunbar on drums), which contained a disc of new material and a disc of live classics. In 2002, the band recorded Sharks; shortly after Sharks was released, Schenker left the band yet again and was replaced with Vinnie Moore.[ UFO on AllMusic] and the official announcement was made in July 2003. In 2003, Michael Schenker and Pete Way released The Plot with drummer Jeff Martin.", "Andy Parker returned in early 2007, after recovering from leg surgery. On the 2008 tour, Pete Way was unable to get a work visa to enter the United States, Rob De Luca (Sebastian Bach's band, Of Earth, Spread Eagle) filling in. ", "UFO released their 19th studio album, The Visitor, in June 2009, and followed with a tour of the UK, but without Pete Way, who was suffering from a medical condition. Bass tracks on The Visitor were played by Peter Pichl, and Pete Way was not credited as a band member on The Visitor cover, nor was any other bassist. However, the album saw UFO's return to the UK Albums Chart for the first time in almost 15 years.", "Longtime keyboardist and guitarist Paul Raymond died from a heart attack on 13 April 2019 at the age of 73. Two weeks later, it was announced that Raymond's initial replacement Neil Carter would be rejoining UFO for the remainder of the band's final tour. Former guitarist Paul Chapman died on his 66th birthday on 9 June 2020. Chapman was followed two months later by original bassist Pete Way, who died from accident injuries at the age of 69."]}, {"page": "Force It", "response": ["* Pete Way \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "No Heavy Petting", "response": ["*Pete Way \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Obsession (UFO album)", "response": ["*Pete Way \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "UFO 2: Flying", "response": ["* Pete Way - bass"]}, {"page": "UFO 1", "response": ["* Pete Way - bass"]}, {"page": "Lights Out (UFO album)", "response": ["*Pete Way \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "No Place to Run (album)", "response": ["#\"Lettin' Go\" (Phil Mogg, Pete Way) - 3:51", "*Pete Way \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Steve Harris (musician)", "response": ["Harris was influenced by the progressive rock bands of the 1970s, as well as early hard rock and heavy metal bands. His influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, and Yes. Speaking about the early Iron Maiden sound, Steve Harris described the band as using twin-guitar harmonies inspired by Wishbone Ash and Thin Lizzy, complex time and mood changes from Genesis and Jethro Tull, and the dark melodic elements of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin. Harris' bass playing was influenced by Yes's Chris Squire and UFO's Pete Way, among others."]}, {"page": "Twisted Sister", "response": ["In June 1982, the group released its first EP, Ruff Cuts, on the Secret Records label, still featuring Tony Petri on the drums. This was followed shortly by the group's first studio album, Under the Blade, produced by Pete Way of UFO. Despite rather low production quality, the album was an underground hit in the UK, providing the band with sufficient name recognition to open for such metal acts as Mot\u00f6rhead. The album had an overall raw metal sound and included \"Tear It Loose\", a very fast speed-metal song featuring a guitar solo by \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke of Mot\u00f6rhead. Another single, the future hit \"We're Not Gonna Take It\", was planned for release, but Secret Records went out of business before Snider was able to complete the lyrics. \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" later became one of its top singles."]}, {"page": "Covenant (UFO album)", "response": ["#\"Unraveled\" (Pete Way, Mogg) \u2013 4:16", "* Pete Way \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Sharks (album)", "response": ["* Pete Way - bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Flogging Molly", "response": ["Prior to forming Flogging Molly, Dublin-born Dave King was the lead singer for heavy metal band Fastway featuring guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke of Mot\u00f6rhead and bassist Pete Way of UFO in the early to mid '80s. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring Mandy Meyer of Krokus on guitars. Afterwards, Dave King retained a record deal with Epic Records and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after."]}]}}
