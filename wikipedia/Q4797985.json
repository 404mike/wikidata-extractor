A Roman source says that Pluto fell in love with Leuca (Greek Leuk\u0113, \"White\"), the most beautiful of the nymphs, and abducted her to live with him in his realm. After the long span of her life came to its end, he memorialized their love by creating a white tree in the Elysian Fields. The tree was the white poplar (Greek leuk\u0113), the leaves of which are white on one side and dark on the other, representing the duality of upper and underworld.Servius, note to Vergil's Eclogue 7.61. Persephone is not mentioned. A wreath of white poplar leaves was fashioned by Heracles to mark his ascent from the underworld, an aition for why it was worn by initiatesBernab\u00e9 and Jim\u00e9nez San Crist\u00f3bal, Instructions for the Netherworld, pp. 93 and 124\u2013125, citing Harpocration. and by champion athletes participating in funeral games.Arthur Calvert, P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V (Cambridge University Press, 1879), p. 48. This was a particular custom of the Rhodians; the heroine Polyxo awarded white poplar wreaths to child athletes at the games she presented in honor of her husband; Pierre Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology (Blackwell, 1986, 1996), p. 385. Like other plants associated with Pluto, white poplar was regarded as a contraceptive in antiquity.Riddle, Contraception and Abortion, p. 33. The relation of this tree to the white cypress of the mysteries is debated.Arthur Bernard Cook, Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion (Cambridge University Press, 1925), pp. 420\u2013422; Bernab\u00e9 and Jim\u00e9nez San Crist\u00f3bal, Instructions for the Netherworld, pp. 25\u201326; W.K.C.

In the Roman world, the bident (from bi-, \"two\" + dent-, \"teeth\") was an agricultural implement. It may also represent one of the three types of lightning wielded by Jupiter, the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and the Etruscan Tinia. The later notion that the ruler of the underworld wielded a trident or bident can perhaps be traced to a line in Seneca's Hercules Furens (\"Hercules Enraged\"), in which Father Dis, the Roman counterpart of Pluto, uses a three-pronged spear to drive off Hercules as he attempts to invade Pylos. Seneca calls Dis the \"Infernal Jove\"Inferni Iovis (genitive case), Hercules Furens line 47, in the prologue spoken by Juno. or the \"dire Jove\"Diro Iovi, line 608 of Hercules Furens; compare Vergil, Aeneid 4.638, Iove Stygio, the \"Jove of the Styx\". Fitch, Seneca's Hercules Furens, p. 156. (the Jove who gives dire or ill omens, dirae), just as in the Greek tradition, Plouton is sometimes identified as a \"chthonic Zeus.\" That the trident and bident might be somewhat interchangeable is suggested by a Byzantine scholiast, who mentions Poseidon being armed with a bident.Codex Augustanus, note to Euripides' Phoenician Women, line 188, as cited by Cook, Zeus, vol. 2, p. 806, note 6.", "This cosmogony interprets Hesiod allegorically, and so the heaviest element is identified not as the Earth, but as the netherworld of Pluto.Van Amersfoort, \"Traces of an Alexandrian Orphic Theogony,\" p. 23; Betegh, The Derveni Papyrus, p. 150.
