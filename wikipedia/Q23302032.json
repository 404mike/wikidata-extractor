NDTV was one of the few news broadcasting companies which had a codified code of conduct for its journalistic output.  The tapes came under the backdrop of the loan granted to NDTV by Reliance and included suggestions from Radia to the journalist MK Venu on how Roy needs to be supported.

The C&AG report on the 2G spectrum case stated a loss of \u20b91.76 trillion (US$25 billion). The initial estimate of loss was 57,000 crores but was revised upward of 1.76 lakh crores.

Raja, and senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, taped by the Indian Income Tax Department in 2008\u201309. The tapes were leaked out to the press, and were eventually published by some media outlets and shown by television channels.", "The revelations in the tapes led to accusations of misconduct by many of these people and served a precursor to the 2G scam and a stronger checks for the media. Niira Radia used to run a public relations firm named 'Vaishnavi Communications' which was the object of CBI investigations.", "In November 2010, OPEN magazine carried a story which reported transcripts of some of the telephone conversations of Niira Radia with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, many of whom have denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation has announced that they have 5,851 recordings of phone conversations by Radia, some of which outline Radia's attempts to broker deals in relation to the 2G spectrum sale. The tapes appear to demonstrate how Radia attempted to use some media persons to influence the decision to appoint A. Raja as telecom minister.", "In the recorded conversations between Niira Radia and prominent figures, referred to as the Radia Tapes, several prominent figures are heard in conversation with Radia:", "Initially, only a handful of the mainstream newspapers in India, like The Deccan Herald, Indian Express had openly written about the tapes.

The Radia tapes is seen to have also made a dent in the image of the media in the country. \"The complete blackout of the Niira Radia tapes by the entire broadcast media and most of the major English newspapers paints a truer picture of corruption in the country,\" wrote G Sampath, the deputy editor of the Daily News and Analysis (DNA) newspaper. After it became an international news, more and more media houses covered the story. The Deccan Chronicle commented, \"The 'Radia tapes' may have torn the veil off the nexus between information hungry journalists, lobbyists and industrialists, and opened everyone\u2019s eyes to what has long been suspected\u00a0\u2014 the ability of a small but powerful group to use their connections to influence policy.\" The largest circulated English newspaper in India and the world, The Times of India finally opened up on 25 November 2010, commenting \"The people are showing who the boss is. The weapon in their hands is the internet, has seen frantic activism against \"power brokering\" by journalists in collusion with corporate groups and top government politicians...\"", "Niira Radia has served a legal notice on The Pioneer, on the report titled \"Tapped and Trapped\" published by the newspaper.
