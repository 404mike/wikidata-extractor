He succeeded in unionising the workforce, and as employers refused to meet the wage demands, he called the dockers out on strike in June.  The Belfast Dock strike was soon joined by carters and coal men, the latter settling their dispute after a month. With active support from the Independent Orange Order and its Grand Master, R. Lindsay Crawford, urging the \"unity of all Irishmen\", Larkin succeeded in uniting Protestant and Catholic workers and even persuaded the local Royal Irish Constabulary to strike at one point, but the strike ended by November without having achieved significant success. Tensions regarding leadership arose between Larkin and NUDL general secretary James Sexton. The latter's handling of negotiations and agreement to a disastrous settlement for the last of the strikers resulted in a lasting rift between Sexton and Larkin."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Sexton"]}, {"page": "National Union of Dock Labourers", "response": [":1893: James Sexton"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*James Sexton, St Helens, 1918\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Sexton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Sexton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir James Sexton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir James Sexton"]}, {"page": "James Saxton", "response": ["*James Sexton, trade unionist and politician"]}, {"page": "St Helens (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| style=\"background-color: \" | || 1918 || James Sexton || Labour", "*Labour: James Sexton"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["| 75 || James Sexton"]}, {"page": "Sexton (surname)", "response": ["*James Sexton (1856\u20131938), English trade unionist and politician"]}, {"page": "1907 Belfast Dock strike", "response": ["It was into this environment and social milieu that trade union leader James Larkin (a Liverpool-born Irish Catholic) arrived in January 1907.

Addressing crowds of people on the steps of Belfast's Custom House, he vociferously articulated the grievances of the working classes. Due to his charismatic personality and considerable oratorial skill, Larkin succeeded in unionising the unskilled Protestant and Catholic workers.", "The Dock strike was ultimately ended on 28 August not by Larkin but by James Sexton, the overall head of the NUDL in Britain and Ireland. Sexton found the 10 shillings a week strike payments that had to be made to the dockers crippling high and, fearing that the union might be bankrupted, negotiated with the employers before agreeing to terms that amounted to capitulation by the NUDL. These separate negotiations with the other employers left the dock labourers isolated."]}, {"page": "1931 New Year Honours", "response": ["*James Sexton  Member of Parliament for St. Helens since 1918.
