Gray progressed through the youth ranks up until the age of 16, when he attracted the interest of Manchester United, and signed for the club for a fee of \u00a350,000 in 2004. Gray was signed by the club as a winger, although Manchester United's coaching staff felt he was better suited as a full-back, and subsequently deployed him in the right-back position for the majority of the club's reserve games during the 2005\u201306 season. After impressing during his first full season in the reserve side, Gray made his first-team debut for Manchester United during the 2006\u201307 season, playing the first 77 minutes in the club's 2\u20131 victory over Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup in October 2006. It ultimately turned out to be Gray's only first-team appearance for the club. Three months after making his first-team debut, in January 2007, he was sent out on loan to Belgian club Royal Antwerp, to gain match experience. However, after just two games he suffered an injury, which ultimately sidelined him for the rest of the season, and he returned to his parent club in May 2007."]}, {"page": "Jason Thomson", "response": ["A Hearts supporter Edinburgh-born Thomson began his career playing for Loanhead Boys Club before joining Hearts Youth Academy, signing a professional contract with the club in July 2003.
