Lloyd eventually conceded that he was struggling to find enthusiasm in the series and instead turned to an idea for a sitcom about the French Resistance which became 'Allo 'Allo!. Five years later Perry and Croft seriously turned their attention to the project. The series is not as well known as the other Perry and Croft sitcoms and was not initially well received by the critics. Despite this the series regularly attracted audiences ratings of 10 million and has been very popular in Hungary.

Perry also wanted Su Pollard to feature in the series as a local Briton wearing square wooden glasses. David Croft was not keen and the series was never taken any further, it was also later pointed out that the series may have been too similar to Up Pompeii! and Monty Python's Life of Brian. In 2009, Perry admitted that he had also written a pilot for another series saying \"The idea I thought could have worked.
