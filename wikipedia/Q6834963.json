Trubshawe was very close friends with fellow British actor David Niven, serving with him at Malta and Dover. He was best man for both of Niven's weddings, and is constantly referred to in Niven's memoirs The Moon's a Balloon. Niven refers to finding out he would be working with him in The Guns of Navarone as 'A lovely bonus for me.'\nNiven claims he lost touch with his army friend following Michael's marriage to scientology follower Margaret L McDougal, the daughter of flour magnate James Gladstone McDougall whose company joined Rank flours. Rank's owners had a Methodist background and the company formed Rank pictures to counter the loose morality of movie culture. Trubshawe was the son of architect Vyvian Trubshawe (1853\u20131924).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21 || Michael Trubshawe || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 79 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || style=\"text-align:left;\"| "]}, {"page": "A Hard Day's Night (film)", "response": ["* Michael Trubshawe as the casino manager"]}, {"page": "A Matter of Life and Death (film)", "response": ["Michael Trubshawe was an old drinking buddy of Niven's and he was given a cameo in this picture by Niven."]}, {"page": "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines", "response": ["* Michael Trubshawe as Niven, Lord Rawnsley's aide"]}, {"page": "The Titfield Thunderbolt", "response": ["* Michael Trubshawe as Ruddock"]}, {"page": "Private's Progress", "response": ["* Michael Trubshawe as Col.
