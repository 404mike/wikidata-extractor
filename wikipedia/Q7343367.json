They were described as a \"rusty wolf-colour\", with black face, lips, and legs. They were very notable for their chasing of slaves. It is not known when the dog was considered a specific breed, but by 1803 it is described thus by Robert Dallas: \"The animal is the size of a very large hound, with ears erect, which are usually cropped at the points; the nose more pointed, but widening very much towards the after-part of the jaw. His coat, or skin, is much harder than that of most dogs, and so must be the whole structure of the body, as the severe beatings he undergoes in training would kill any other species of dog.\""]}, {"page": "Justice of Chester", "response": ["|Robert Dallas"]}, {"page": "Dallas (name)", "response": ["* Robert Dallas (1756\u20131824), British judge"]}, {"page": "Liverpool ministry", "response": ["| Sir Robert Dallas"]}, {"page": "Sir George Dallas, 1st Baronet", "response": ["On 11 June 1788, Dallas married Margaret Catherine Blackwood, the daughter of Sir John Blackwood, 2nd Baronet, and Dorcas, Lady Dufferin and Claneboye.
