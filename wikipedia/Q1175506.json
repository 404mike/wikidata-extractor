At the time Tietmeyer forecast that the common currency would lead to painful internal economic adjustments for member states with trade deficits cumulating into debt. Commentator David Marsh in late 2012 drew attention to that forecast as he highlighted \"the significant internal devaluations of their currencies though a sharp fall in unit labor costs\" which Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, for example, have suffered in the European sovereign-debt crisis of 2008 onward. This effect of the Euro is similar to the impact of \"the classical gold standard\", wrote Marsh in describing the phenomenon.Marsh, David, \"Arise, Draghi the optimist\" (commentary), MarketWatch, December 24, 2012.

So the pressure on Germany is to keep the balances growing, in order to avoid crystallization of losses that would be hugely damaging not just to Berlin but also to central banks and governments in Paris and Rome\".Marsh, David, \"10 myths about the European quagmire\", MarketWatch, 27 February 2012.
