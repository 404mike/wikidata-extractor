While in the Army he served in the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Wiltshire Regiment during World War I. Following the war he joined Trowbridge Town in August 1919, and after just two months playing in the Wiltshire League he was snapped up by Southern League side Bristol Rovers.\nDespite conceding five goals to Norwich City on his Rovers debut he went on to become a first team regular for The Pirates, playing in 246 consecutive League games between August 1922 and April 1928, a Football League record for most consecutive games that stood until 1953. By the time he retired from professional football in 1930 he had played 386 League games for Rovers; 14 in the Southern League and 372 in the Football League. He continued playing non-League football in Bristol for a further two years, for Stapleton Institute and Mental Institution Club, later moving into coaching, becoming coach of Fry's Cocoa Tree Boys in 1937. In 1939 he was appointed as manager of Downend Football Club, and two years later he took charge of Soundwell.\nFollowing the end of his playing days he worked on a farm in Westerleigh, Gloucestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Jesse Whatley"]}, {"page": "Whatley (surname)", "response": ["* Jesse Whatley (1895\u20131982), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Bristol Rovers F.C. players", "response": ["In the club's early history the appearance record was held by goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge,Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 82 who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909.Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 88 His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall.Jay & Byrne (1994), pp. 286\u2013287 Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until the abolition of the maximum wage in football in 1961; as a result some players in that era had a high number of appearances for the club.Giles (2007), p. 22 Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances.
