Her aunt was Sophia Jex-Blake, a pioneer in the fight for women's access to higher education; her sister, Henrietta Jex-Blake, would go on to be Principal of Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. Jex-Blake was educated at home with her sisters by masters from Rugby School before reading classics at Girton College, Cambridge, 1879\u20131883. Although the passing of the so-called Three Graces in 1881 meant women were permitted to formally sit University exams from 1882, Jex-Blake was not considered a full member of the University and was thus not eligible for a degree. She was ranked in the third division of the first class in Part I of the Classical Tripos for women in 1882, one of the two highest performing female candidates. In Part II of the Classical Tripos, which allowed specialisation in particular sub-disciplines such as archaeology and philosophy rather than focusing on linguistic competence as in Part I, Jex-Blake was the only woman to be placed in the third class."]}, {"page": "Thomas Jex-Blake", "response": ["He had married Henrietta Cordery in 1857: they had two sons and nine daughters.
