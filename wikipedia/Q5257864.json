Different forms of patriarchal oppression necessitate tailored patriarchal bargains, thus the concept can be used to reveal the particular dimensions of patriarchy in its various modalities across societies and cultures. The term was coined by Turkish author and researcher Deniz Kandiyoti in her 1988 article, \"Bargaining with Patriarchy\", which appeared in the September issue of Gender & Society.  ", "In the original article, Deniz Kandiyoti examines patriarchal bargains in the \"classic patriarchy\" of the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, and a polygynous system in Sub-Saharan Africa. The latter is presented as one end of a continuum at which women retain a relatively high level of autonomy by participating individually in rice-growing schemes and trade. As a result of the men's dependence on women's labour, concessions are made in the form of wages and land."]}, {"page": "List of feminist economists", "response": ["* Deniz Kandiyoti (born 1944), Turkish-British, emeritus professor in development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London"]}, {"page": "Bride price", "response": ["In many parts of Central Asia nowadays, bride price is mostly symbolic.  Various names for it in Central Asia include  ,  ,  , and  .  It is also common in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The price may range from a small sum of money or a single piece of livestock to what amounts to a herd of livestock, depending on local traditions and the expectations and agreements of the families involved. The tradition is upheld in Afghanistan. A \"dark distortion\" of it involved a 6-year-old daughter of an Afghan refugee from Helmand Province in a Kabul refugee camp, who was to be married to the son of the money lender who provided with the girl's father $2500 so the man could pay medical bills. According to anthropologist Deniz Kandiyoti, the practice increased after the fall of the Taliban. It is still practised by Muslims in the region and is called Mahr."]}]}}
