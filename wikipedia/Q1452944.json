During the First World War he was forced to retire in May 1918 after writing a letter to The Times criticizing Prime Minister David Lloyd George for making misleading statements about the strength of British forces on the Western Front. He also founded the British Legion in 1920, and served as its president from 1932 to 1947.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 1918", "response": ["* Liberal Party leader H. H. Asquith took up allegations of the British War Cabinet misleading Parliament about troop strengths on the Western Front from a letter published in the press on May 7 by Major-General Frederick Barton Maurice of the British Army. The fierce debate in the House of Commons lead to Prime Minister David Lloyd George refuting the claims and treating the issue as a vote of confidence, allowing him to win the debate and tip perception against Asquith as not being an effective wartime leader. The resulting vote was in favor of government support 295 votes to 108, although about half of the Members of Parliament were absent as they were serving in the war.Gooch, John. \"The Maurice Debate 1918,\" Journal of Contemporary History (1968) 3#4 pp. 211\u2013228 in JSTORCook, Chris.
