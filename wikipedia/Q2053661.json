He remained with Grimsby for a further four years in which he earnt international caps for England U18 as well as becoming the club captain at a young age. In his final full season, he scooped the board in the club's player of the season ceremony. Grimsby Town cashed in on him in 2010 by selling him to Peterborough United after an initial loan deal. Whilst with Peterborough he represented England U21s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Justin Whittle", "response": ["Despite the club struggling in the league, Whittle was voted \"Player of The Season\" for his efforts and earned himself a 1-year contract extension. It was apparent from the start of the following season that Whittle was to play a smaller or less important role in the club's affairs. The number 6 shirt he had held since he arrived was stripped of him and he was listed as number 15 in the squad. Fitness and injury worries plagued Whittle and when fit, he was often named as a substitute playing second fiddle to the likes of Nick Fenton, Ryan Bennett and Rob Atkinson. As well as this Whittle was not used in the club's Wembley appearance in the Football League Trophy final in March. In April 2008 it was decided by the club that they would not offer Justin Whittle an extension to his contract and he left on good terms in May after playing some of his best football with the Mariners."]}]}}
