(In the 1970s and 1980s, Heseltine's conference speech was often the highlight of the Conservative Party Conference, despite his views being well to the left of the then leader Margaret Thatcher.)

Lindsay Masters stayed behind, very likely in the knowledge that he might soon be running the company as Heseltine's political career took off. However, Heseltine continued as Managing Director of Haymarket even after being elected to Parliament in March 1966, and based himself at the company offices near Oxford Circus rather than in the House of Commons.Crick 1997, pp. 136\u20137.

At this time Baker was often tipped as a future Conservative leader, including in the 1987 edition of Julian Critchley's biography of Michael Heseltine. Critchley quoted one journalist's witticism \"I have seen the future and it smirks\" (a reference to the famous line \"I have seen the future and it works\" written by Lincoln Steffens, an American visitor to Lenin's USSR in 1921).

Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for \"a good-looking fellow\" when it came to making government appointments. \"Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job.\" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.Daily Mirror, 30 July 2012Thatcher's eye for good-looking male politicians"]}, {"page": "Julian Michael Gordon Critchley", "response": ["#redirect Julian Critchley"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Julian Critchley"]}, {"page": "Arthur Bottomley", "response": ["He was first elected to parliament in the 1945 general election for the Chatham division of Rochester and he held the seat (later renamed Rochester and Chatham) until losing it in the 1959 general election to the Conservative Julian Critchley.

The motion was carried by 105 votes to 95, and the tabloid newspapers made a great story from the outcome. Chenevix-Trench did not change his approach, nor did he object to the continuation of the tradition of fagging, nor that of older boys having the right to use corporal punishment on younger boys.
