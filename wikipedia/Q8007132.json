The painting of the animal was first published posthumously in 1820 by his brother. William Cornwallis Harris, in his 1840 book about big game hunting, was quite familiar with the species in the Cashan Mountains and Kurrichane Hills, and renders the name as \"sassaybe\". Sassaby had thus become the common name for this antelope in Southern Africa by the end of the 19th century. The English later recorded the Tswana name for the antelope as tsess\u0115be, by 1895 it was thought that this was the origin for the anglicised word. Other names for the antelope which were recorded by Frederick Selous around this time were inkweko in the language of the Masubians of the Caprivi Strip (related to Lozi), incolomo and incomazan in the isiNdebele of \"Matebele\", unchuru was the Sekuba name given by the Makuba of northern Botswana, inyundo by the Makalaka, and luchu or lechu by the Masaras. The antelope was recorded as called myanzi in isiZulu and the bastaard hartebeest by the Afrikaners, indeed it looks somewhat like a cross between a hartebeest and a horse. The new vernacular name 'common tsessebe' was invented by Peter Grubb in 2005 to refer to Damaliscus lunatus lunatus to distinguish it from the new Bangweulu taxon."]}, {"page": "Ankober", "response": ["The first Europeans to record their visit to Ankober were the Evangelical missionaries Carl Wilhelm Isenberg and Johann Ludwig Krapf in 1839.Published as Journals of the Rev.

In the following years, a steady stream of travellers visited Ankober, including Captain William Cornwallis Harris. Following the death of Meridazmach Sahle Selassie in 1847, the Abichu Oromo rebelled and attacked Ankober; only the firearms Sahle Selassie had collected there saved the capital. The Shewans burned the town in 1856 in reaction to the invasion, and eventual conquest, of Emperor Tewodros II."]}, {"page": "William Harris", "response": ["*William Cornwallis Harris (1807\u20131848), English military engineer, artist and hunter"]}, {"page": "Tadjoura", "response": ["  During the Middle Ages, Tadjoura was ruled by the Ifat Sultanate and then the Adal Sultanate. Tadjoura was the capital of one of the four Afar Sultanates (Tadjoura, Raheita, Awsa and Goba'ad) that emerged from the Adal Sultanate, and as a port and transshipment point for goods from Shewa and Awsa (Ethiopia). The trade with the Afar Depression was mainly carried out by women who brought their goods to Tadjoura on camels, while the men stayed at home, as tribal feuds were not uncommon. According to Mordechai Abir, Tadjoura originally was the seat of the Afar Ad-Ali Abli Sultanate as well as a port. This ruler, known as the Dardar, \"claimed authority over all of the northern Adoimara Afar to the borders of Showa. However, although it was true that some sub-clans of the Ad-Ali and Abli Adoimara roamed as far as the borders of Yifat, even the staunchest supporters of the Sultan agreed that his actual authority did not stretch beyond Lake Assal, a short distance from Tadjoura.\"Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855) (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 20 The Richard Pankhurst notes that it differed from neighboring ports by handling almost entirely the trade of Shewa and Aussa, \"rather than that of Harar or the Ogaden.\" He quotes William Cornwallis Harris' description of an annual bazaar that started each September, when \"for two months the beach is piled with merchandise, and the suburbs are crowded with camels, mules and donkeys.\" Pankhurst also cites C.T. Beke that the trade with the inhabitants of the Afar Depression was handled entirely by women, \"who loaded the camels, bought and sold while the men kept away altogether 'to avoid bloodshed, this country being the scene of constant feuds among the different tribes.'\"Richard K.P. Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), pp. 429. While Abir observes that the port is not mentioned in all of the material about the Red Sea in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, by the mid-19th century Tadjoura was thriving, \"while all the other so-called Afar sultanates along the coast were described ... as small decaying villages of no political or commercial importance.\"Abir, Era of the Princes, pp. 20f Tadjoura owed this success to possessing a major slave market; Pankhurst suggests that a rough estimate of 6,000 people a year left Ethiopia through Tadjoura and Zeila.Pankhurst, p. 83. The other important commodity sold in Tadjoura in the 19th century was ivory, brought by caravans from Aliyu Amba.Pankhurst, p. 249. Other goods exported included wheat, durra, honey, gold, ostrich feathers, senna, madder, and civetone. The value of trade in 1880-1 was estimated at the time as 29,656 rupees in exports and 18,513 rupees in imports."]}, {"page": "Charles Tilstone Beke", "response": ["Between 1837 and 1838, Beke held the post of acting British consul in Saxony.
