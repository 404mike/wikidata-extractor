A member of Bramley Wheelers Cycling Club in Leeds, his career was short-lived. He damaged an ankle in an accident when leading in a race on Winnats Pass in November 1951 which ultimately resulted in his early retirement.Ronnie Stringwell was 22 when he won the National Hill Climb Championship in 1950 on Barbers Hill, Llangollen, North Wales, beating the previous years champion Bob Maitland into second place.\n\n1st - R. Stringwell Bramley Wheelers CC - 4 mins 33 2/5secs\n2nd - B. Maitland Concorde RCC - 4 mins 35 1/5secs\n3rd - B. Robinson Huddersfield RC - 4 mins 39 secsIn 1951 he repeated his success by winning again at Saintbury Hill in Gloucestershire; he was the only rider other than Ken Joy to retain a championship title won in 1950.\nThere can be no doubt that he proved himself worthy of this honour with a performance that not only dwarfed his competitors but once again demonstrated the qualities of a true champion. The first climb of note on the day was Peter Proctor whose time stood as fastest for a long while until Brian Robinson rode up in a record time 13 seconds faster than Proctor. No one thought this could be bettered, particularly when the times of riders the calibre of Maitland, Pentecost and Haskell were considered, but the measure of Stringwell\u2019s victory lies in the 4 and 1/5th seconds by which he beat Robinson with Proctor relegated to third place.\n\n1st - R.
