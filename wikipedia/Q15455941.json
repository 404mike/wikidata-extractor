Emigrating to London before World War II through business, in the postwar years he became one of a generation of Hungarian artists working abroad.  During the war, he worked for the British Ministry of Labour.  With exiled Hungarians, he also worked to found a postwar socialist government in Hungary, but they were defeated by the Soviet Union.\nIn the early postwar years, he studied photography in Paris with fellow Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Ervin Marton, already a recognized artist.  Returning to London, Peto established his career as a photojournalist, covering the 1948 Summer Olympics and starting on staff of The Observer in 1949. He gained recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, capturing British cultural life, including figures ranging from ballet dancers Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev to The Beatles. He also traveled internationally and produced many photographs of people and regions around the world. Archive Services at the University of Dundee hold the Michael Peto Collection, which includes thousands of photographs, negatives, slides, publications and papers.", "link_mentions": {}}}
