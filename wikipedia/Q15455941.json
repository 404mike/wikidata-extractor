Emigrating to London before World War II through business, in the postwar years he became one of a generation of Hungarian artists working abroad.  During the war, he worked for the British Ministry of Labour.  With exiled Hungarians, he also worked to found a postwar socialist government in Hungary, but they were defeated by the Soviet Union.\nIn the early postwar years, he studied photography in Paris with fellow Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Ervin Marton, already a recognized artist.  Returning to London, Peto established his career as a photojournalist, covering the 1948 Summer Olympics and starting on staff of The Observer in 1949. He gained recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, capturing British cultural life, including figures ranging from ballet dancers Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev to The Beatles.

As early as 1447  King James II of Scotland granted letters patent to Dundee's Council granting them the right to collect dues on goods coming in via the port. In 1770 the harbour was  remodelled by John Smeaton, who introduced water tunnels to tackle the perennial problems caused by the vast quantities of silt washed down the Tay which formed sandbanks in the harbour, thus blocking it. In 1815 a Harbour Act was passed which moved control of the harbour from the Town Council to a Board of Harbour Commissioners. Under their guidance the harbour was greatly expanded from the 1820s with the addition of King William IV Dock, Earl Grey Dock, Victoria Dock and Camperdown Dock. In 1844 a triumphal arch made of timber was erected at the entrance of the harbour to mark the arrival, by sea, of Queen Victoria on her way to her first holiday in Aberdeenshire. In 1849 a competition was held to design a replacement permanent structure. The competition was won by a design submitted by James Thomas Rochead. The resulting Royal Arch quickly became one of Dundee's most iconic symbols.  King William IV Dock and the Early Grey Dock were filled in by the 1960s during the construction of the Tay Road Bridge and its approach roads, with the Royal Arch being demolished at the same time. The Arch is the subject of a famous photograph by the photojournalist Michael Peto."]}, {"page": "Genesis Publications", "response": ["* 2006 Now These Days Are Gone by Michael Peto"]}, {"page": "Royal Arch (structure)", "response": ["* A famous photograph of the arch taken by noted photojournalist Michael Peto in 1959, is held by the archive services of University of Dundee and is available to view online."]}, {"page": "Michael peto", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Peto "]}, {"page": "Peto", "response": ["*Michael Peto, also known as Mih\u00e1ly Pet\u00f6 (1908\u20131970), Hungarian-British photojournalist"]}, {"page": "Ervin Marton", "response": ["The strong Hungarian connections within the Parisian art community continued to flourish.
