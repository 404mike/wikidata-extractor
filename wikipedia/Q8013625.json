William John Hardy writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, in a volume published in 1891, suggested that he may possibly have been the \"brother or half-brother of the royalist Anthony, for the Hungerfords often gave the same Christian name to more than one of their children\", but Stephen Wright updating Hardy's article for the Oxford Dictionary of Biography suggests that \"he may have been the son of Thomas Hungerford, gentleman of Garsdon, Wiltshire. As a young child he was acquainted with Sir John Danvers (d. 1655) of Dauntsey, an estate close to properties owned by a junior branch of the Hungerford family at Garsdon.
