In the 1930s his family moved to Nottingham, where he attended the Mundella Grammar School from 1934 to 1939. From 1949 to 1952 he attended Royal College of Art, where his teachers were Ruskin Spear, Carel Weight and John Minton. His fellow students included Derrick Greaves and Jack Smith. Middleditch associated early on with the so-called 'Kitchen Sink' school of realist painters in the 1950s. He held teaching posts at Chelsea School of Art, St Martins School of Art, and Norwich School of Art (where he became head of fine art).He was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1973, later as Keeper of the Royal Academy (in charge of the schools). Middleditch exhibited widely and is represented in major and regional collections in UK, US, Canada, and Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kitchen sink realism", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, the term \"kitchen sink\" derived from an expressionist painting by John Bratby which contained an image of a kitchen sink. Bratby did various kitchen and bathroom-themed paintings, including three paintings of toilets. Bratby's paintings of people often depicted the faces of his subjects as desperate and unsightly.Ian Chilvers; John Glaves-Smith (2009). A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art. Oxford University Press. p. 259. \"John Bratby 1928\u20131992\". Tate. Retrieved 6 January 2014. Kitchen sink realism artists painted everyday objects, such as trash cans and beer bottles. The critic David Sylvester wrote an article in 1954 about trends in recent English art, calling his article \"The Kitchen Sink\" in reference to Bratby's picture. Sylvester argued that there was a new interest among young painters in domestic scenes, with stress on the banality of life. Other artists associated with the kitchen sink style include Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith."]}, {"page": "Beaux Arts Gallery", "response": ["Beaux Arts Gallery also became associated with the Kitchen Sink School (and later the School of London) and its prominent members; John Bratby, Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith."]}, {"page": "John Bratby", "response": ["Bratby is considered the founder of kitchen sink realism a movement in which artists use everyday objects, like trash cans and beer bottles as subjects of their works, which are often thickly-laden portraits or paintings. It began in the early 1950s and has been considered an aspect of John Osborne's \"Angry Young Men\" movement. Artists Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith were also active in the development of the movement. Bratby often painted with bright colours, capturing his middle-class family's daily lives. The faces of his subjects often appeared desperate and unsightly. Bratby painted several kitchen subjects, often turning practical utensils such as sieves and spoons into semi-abstract shapes. He also painted bathrooms, and made three paintings of toilets. Initially there was some critical interest, but English critics later disregarded it as an important movement."]}, {"page": "The Nottingham Emmanuel School", "response": ["* Edward Middleditch, artist"]}, {"page": "Buildings of Nuffield College, Oxford", "response": ["The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels.Jebb, p. 153 The furniture in the hall was designed by, and the chairs were built by, Edward Barnsley.
