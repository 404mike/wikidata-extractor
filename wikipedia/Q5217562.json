However, Gyllenhaal dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Nightcrawler, and was subsequently replaced by Billy Magnussen.

In June 2013, Walt Disney Studios publicly announced that the film had been greenlighted, and scheduled a release date for Christmas Day 2014.  In July, MacKenzie Mauzy, Tammy Blanchard, Lucy Punch and Daniel Huttlestone joined the cast. Mauzy later revealed that she first auditioned for Cinderella but did not get the part.

In early August, Sophia Grace Brownlee's representatives announced that she had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood. The announcement of Brownlee's casting, which was widely reported but never confirmed by Disney, was criticized as \"a stunt\" and was met with concern due to her age and the sexual undertones present between Little Red and the Wolf. The film's plot synopsis and the official casting of lead actors Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and Emily Blunt were revealed at the D23 Expo on August 10, 2013.

Crawford auditioned for Marshall via Skype, who offered her the role within two hours. Crawford was on a flight to London the next day as a result. Later on, Dominic Brownlee spoke about the withdrawal of his daughter Sophia Grace from the movie: \"After careful consideration, we the parents of Sophia Grace, felt that as rehearsals progressed that she was too young for this part.
