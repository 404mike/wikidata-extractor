A directive issued by the British sports minister Neil Macfarlane in April, at the start of the conflict, suggested that there should be no contact between British representative teams and Argentina. This directive was not rescinded until August, following the end of hostilities. Macfarlane reported to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that some players and officials were uneasy about participating because of the casualties suffered by British forces, and the strong diplomatic ties between Argentina and Spain. FIFA advised the British Government that there was no prospect that Argentina (the defending champions) would be asked to withdraw. It also became apparent that no other countries would withdraw from the tournament. It was decided by Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong to allow the British national teams to participate so that Argentina could not use their absence for propaganda purposes, reversing the intended effect of applying political pressure onto Argentina."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Neil Macfarlane"]}, {"page": "List of ministers under Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["!scope=row|Neil Macfarlane", "!scope=row|Neil Macfarlane"]}, {"page": "Minister for Sport and Civil Society", "response": ["| width=200|Neil Macfarlane"]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The film ToryBoy The Movie followed the election, directed by and starring John Walsh who documented how he became a candidate for the Conservative Party in Middlesbrough, challenging the sitting MP, Stuart Bell.
