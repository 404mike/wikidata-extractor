Ricketts started the season with a 1\u20130 win at home to Portsmouth on 4 August, with loanee Ryan Giles scoring the goal. During the 2019\u201320 season, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the second time during his management spell, defeating Bradford City, Mansfield Town and Bristol City along the way. The fourth round would see Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side host Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, where Shrewsbury came from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with 2 goals from substitute Jason Cummings, forcing a replay at Anfield. In the replay, Shrewsbury fell short after a Shaun Whalley goal was disallowed by VAR for offside and an own goal from Ro-Shaun Williams saw the hosts win 1\u20130. This cup run brought repercussions, however, as Ricketts and the club went 10 league games without a win between December 2019 and February 2020. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Accrington Stanley on 11 February 2020 followed by another 2\u20130 defeat away at Portsmouth on 15 February put Ricketts' job under severe pressure. The winless run ended a week later on 22 February after a 1\u20130 win at home to Doncaster Rovers. On 14 March 2020, Ricketts and his Shrewsbury side were scheduled to take on top-of-the-table Coventry City at St Andrew's, however the match was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the 2019\u201320 League One season was cut short and it was decided that final league positions would be based on a points-per-game basis. This saw the club finish 15th in the final table."]}, {"page": "Landale", "response": ["* Ethan Ebanks-Landell (born 1992), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Ethan (given name)", "response": ["*Ethan Ebanks-Landell (born 1992), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Chris Basham", "response": ["In the 2016\u201317 season, Basham continued to be in the first team regular at the club following the arrival of Manager Chris Wilder and played in the midfield position. Basham then scored his first goal of the season, but was later sent-off in the second half, in a 2\u20132 draw against Scunthorpe United on 24 September 2016. After serving a three match suspension, Basham returned to the first team, on 18 October 2016, making his first start from suspension, in a 3\u20130 win against Shrewsbury Town, followed up by scoring in the next game, in a 3\u20133 draw against Bradford City. Two weeks later, on 6 November 2016, Basham scored and set up one of the goals, in a 6\u20130 win over Leyton Orient in the first round of the FA Cup. Due to his impressive performance at the club, Manager Wilder hinted that Basham could be earning a new contract, with a year to his contract left. As the 2016\u201317 season progressed, Basham began to play in the defense, as a centre-back, partnering with either Jack O'Connell, Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Jake Wright. Around the same time, Basham played in the midfield position, with Paul Coutts. Then, in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale on 14 April 2017, Basham produced an impressive display when he set up two goals. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, which saw Sheffield United promoted to Championship after six seasons in League One, Basham went on to make 48 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premier Reserve League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Ethan Ebanks-Landell"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 9 November 2012 || Ethan Ebanks-Landell || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Bury || style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 January 2013", "| 10 January 2013 || Ethan Ebanks-Landell || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Bury || style=\"text-align:center;\"|End of season"]}, {"page": "Ebanks", "response": ["*Ethan Ebanks-Landell (born 1992), English footballer who plays defender"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2016 || Ethan Ebanks-Landell || style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Sheffield United || style=\"text-align:center;\"| End of season"]}]}}
