Her name today is synonymous with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (Welsh: Bwrdd Iechyd Prifysgol Betsi Cadwaladr), the largest health organisation in Wales. In 2016, she was named as one of \"the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time\". and was placed ahead of such famous Welsh individuals as the singer Tom Jones, the actor Anthony Hopkins, T.E. Lawrence and Ivor Novello.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
