The new company also promoted other sports including tennis, baseball and lacrosse. Elcoat became involved in baseball within the local area; acting as an umpire and was also chairman of the Cleveland and South Durham Baseball Association. In 1895 he was appointed secretary-manager of Stockton after the incumbent was sacked for failing to provide documents to the club's accountant.\nIn March 1898 he was offered the post of secretary-manager of Woolwich Arsenal. He accepted the offer on 30 March 1898 and started on 11 April 1898. Between 1986 and 2011 it had been mistakenly accepted that William's younger brother George was Woolwich Arsenal's manager.\nElcoat's tenure at Woolwich Arsenal was quite short - he resigned on 20 February 1899 citing difficulties with the club's board of directors. The club was renowned for its high turnover of players and Elcoat maintained this by buying 13 players and selling 11 during his 10 months at the club.\nFollowing his resignation he moved back to Stockton. He died in 1912 aged 52.\nWhilst he resided in Norton on his return to Stockton, he had a road named after him in the village, Elcoat Road which still stands today.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Dick (footballer, born 1876)", "response": ["Born in Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, Dick first played for Airdrieonians, but in 1898 he was signed by London side Woolwich Arsenal as one of manager William Elcoat's many Scottish signings, with reserve striker James Devlin going the other way. A strong muscular centre half (in those days the centre half played in midfield), Dick immediately made his debut for Arsenal on the first day of the season (against Luton Town on 3 September 1898), and he only missed four games of his first season."]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. managers", "response": ["Although Arsenal was founded in 1886, it was not until 1897 that the club appointed a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post barely a year into his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6\u20130 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season."]}, {"page": "Elcoat, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Elcoat"]}]}}
