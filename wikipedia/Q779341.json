He pursued a successful career as an actor-manager, specialising in debonair, often disreputable, parts in popular comedies. He occasionally played in Sheridan and other classics, but was generally associated with new works by writers including Oscar Wilde and Somerset Maugham.\nBorn to a long-established county family, Hawtrey was one of three of his parents' five sons to pursue a theatrical career. Before going on the stage he had considered joining the army, but failed to apply himself to the necessary studies to qualify for a commission. Once established as an actor he quickly took on the additional role of a manager, boosted by an early success with his own adaptation of a German farce presented in London as The Private Secretary, which made his fortune. A lifelong gambler, both with theatrical productions and on horseracing, to which he was addicted, he was bankrupted several times during his career.\nRegarded as Britain's leading comedy actor of his generation, Hawtrey was mentor and role model to younger actors including No\u00ebl Coward. Towards the end of his career Hawtrey starred in a handful of silent movies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)", "response": ["George Frederick Joffre Hartree (30 November 1914\u00a0\u2013 27 October 1988), known as Charles Hawtrey, was an English comedy actor and musician.", "Born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England in 1914, to William John Hartree (1885\u20131952) and his wife Alice (n\u00e9e Crow) (1880\u20131965), of 217 Cromwell Road, as George Frederick Joffre Hartree, he took his stage name from the theatrical knight, Sir Charles Hawtrey, whose surname was a different spelling of his own, and encouraged the suggestion that he was his son.
