Uniquely, Murray Halberg used a sprinter's crouched start in lane 1 and sprinted into the lead from the gun.  In future years, this kind of start would become forbidden in a long race.  Halberg held that lead until there were two laps to go where he was passed in a rush by Mervyn Lincoln running in front of a home crowd.  Lincoln held the lead until just after the bell when he was swallowed up by a rush led by Brian Hewson.  Ten men went around Lincoln and he was cooked.  Klaus Richtzenhain was the next to follow with Halberg making one more rush down the backstretch before he too was cooked.  From tenth place, Ron Delany began picking off runners on the backstretch, as Halberg slowed, Delany used the traffic to step into fifth place at the start of the final turn.  Passing in lane 2, Delany ran around the field, catching Hewson at the head of the straightaway.  Hewson looked helplessly at Delany as he passed.  Fighting out of the group Delany passed at the start of the turn, another home town favorite John Landy chased from behind, still in sixth at the head of the straight.  With a stiff, upright sprinting style, Delany pulled away from the field.  Hewson struggled down the final straight, watching Richtzenhain run past on the outside.  Landy made a late final charge in lane 3 but just came up short in trying to catch Richtzenhain for silver.", "This was the 13th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Two finalists from the 1952 Games returned: gold medalist Josy Barthel of Luxembourg and eighth-place finisher Ingvar Ericsson of Sweden. The world record had changed hands six times since the 1952 Games; three of the men who had had it but were surpassed (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00e1bori of Hungary, John Landy of Australia, and Gunnar Nielsen of Denmark) competed in Melbourne, along with the man who still held it (Istv\u00e1n R\u00f3zsav\u00f6lgyi]] of Hungary). Five men had run a sub-four minute mile; the first to do so (Roger Bannister of Great Britain, who had finished fourth in this event in 1952) had retired, but three of those men (T\u00e1bori, Landy, and Brian Hewson, also of Great Britain) competed.", "|align=left| Brian Hewson ||align=left| ", "|align=left| Brian Hewson ||align=left| ", "|align=left| Brian Hewson ||align=left| "]}, {"page": "April 4", "response": ["*  1933   \u2013 Brian Hewson, English runner"]}, {"page": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00e1bori", "response": ["T\u00e1bori was born in Ko\u0161ice.

Already part of the world-record-breaking 1953 and 1954 4 x 1500 metres relay teams of Hungary and the Honv\u00e9d Budapest club respectively, he exploded to international fame in 1955, together with Igl\u00f3i's other star pupils, S\u00e1ndor Iharos and Istv\u00e1n R\u00f3zsav\u00f6lgyi.
