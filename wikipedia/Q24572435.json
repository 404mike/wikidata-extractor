She inherited some of grandfather Phil's interest in music, learning to play the piano and singing solos at carol concerts. Pip has a clear interest in farming, and also caring for the environment. Pip split from her first boyfriend called Jonathan, a boy she met at her YFC (Young Farmers Club) and began an affair with a much older man, a mature student at Borchester College called Jude Simpson. Her parents did not approve. Jude eventually left the country without her after leading Pip to believe that they were going on a round the world backpacking trip together.  After a work placement in Yorkshire she became more focused on her future and the future of the farm.  She finished her degree in the summer of 2015 and accepted a post with an international agri-business with which she could gain experience of farming around the world. But during the initial orientation, she changed her mind and decided to return home to Ambridge and work with her parents at Brookfield. She became involved with Toby Fairbrother a son of Robin Fairbrother (who briefly romanced Elizabeth many years ago). As a result, Pip became pregnant leading to the birth of Rosie Ruth Grace Archer, her third forename recognising the Fairbrother heritage."]}, {"page": "Ruth Archer", "response": ["Ruth continued with her studies at Harper Adams and she and David eventually established \"a good working relationship\". Ruth was given the responsibility of looking after the dairy herd, before becoming a partner in the farm. Ruth and David's first child, Philippa Rose, or Pip (Helen Monks; Daisy Badger), was born in February 1993. Joanna Toye and Adrian Flynn, authors of The Archers Encyclopaedia, said Ruth took to motherhood well and did not let it stop her from playing an active part in Brookfield. The couple's second child, Joshua (Cian Cheesbrough; Angus Imrie), was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some Hereford cattle and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm.Toye 2001, p.31. Ruth told David that \"time was too precious to spend in argument\" and suggested they moved away.
