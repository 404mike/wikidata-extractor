When Venables was let out on parole, his psychiatrist, Susan Bailey, reported that \"visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.\"", "Thompson and Venables were considered by the court to be capable of \"mischievous discretion\", meaning an ability to act with criminal intent as they were mature enough to understand that they were doing something seriously wrong. A child psychiatrist, Eileen Vizard, who interviewed Thompson before the trial, was asked in court whether he would know the difference between right and wrong, that it was wrong to take a young child away from his mother, and that it was wrong to cause injury to a child. Vizard replied, \"If the issue is on the balance of probabilities, I think I can answer with certainty.\" Vizard also said that Thompson was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on Bulger. Susan Bailey, the Home Office forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Venables, said unequivocally that he knew the difference between right and wrong."]}, {"page": "Starmus Festival", "response": ["Another panel discussion dealt with the issues of outreach and education and was moderated by David Eicher, with Torsten Wiesel, Alexandra Witze, Susan Bailey, Claude Nicollier, Markus Reymann, Sandra Magnus, May-Britt Moser and Ane Brun as speakers."]}, {"page": "Susan Mary Bailey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Susan Bailey"]}, {"page": "Sue Bailey", "response": ["* Susan Bailey (born 1950), British psychiatrist and academic"]}, {"page": "Dame Susan Bailey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Susan Bailey"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Manchester history", "response": ["* 1960 \u2013 29 August: Susan Bailey, child psychiatrist"]}, {"page": "York Medical Society", "response": ["Orators in the early years included Sir Clifford Allbutt, Sir Victor Horsley, Sir James Crichton-Browne, Sir German Sims Woodhead, Sir T.
