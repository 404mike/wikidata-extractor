ABC electoral psephologist Antony Green wrote several publications on various aspects of the proposed Senate reforms.", "It will be seen that the leading Labor and Liberal candidates, Hutchins and Heffernan, polled more than the quota. They were therefore elected on the first count. Their surplus votes were then distributed. The surplus is the candidate's vote minus the quota. Hutchins's surplus was thus 1,446,231 minus 536,533, or 909,698.

Through persistent questions over his leadership, Hewson's consistent response was that \"leadership is not an issue\".
