He also appeared in the county's home win against Leicestershire a week later; this match resulted in Worcestershire's first ever victory in the County Championship.\nIn 1900, Fereday made six appearances for the county, though he could muster only 77 runs in 11 innings with a best of just 18. He did, however, take his only two first-class wickets that summer: a caught and bowled dismissal of the little-known Yorkshire bowler Harry Riley and an lbw decision against Warwickshire stalwart Crowther Charlesworth. The following year he made his last two appearances at first-class level, his final match being a thrilling tie against the touring South Africans in which he made a career-best score of 37.\nAfter retiring from county cricket, Fereday played in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire for several years. He died at the age of 84 at Holy Cross, Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
