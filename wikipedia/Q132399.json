The jury did not believe his version of events, and on 20 April he was sentenced by Justice Ormerod to be hanged. He was gaoled at Strangeways Prison to await execution. Because Inglis did not appeal against his sentence, execution was scheduled to take place only three weeks after the trial ended (according to law, after the passage of three Sundays).On the morning of 8 May 1951, the executioner, Albert Pierrepoint and his assistant, Syd Dernley, escorted Inglis from his cell to the gallows immediately adjacent, and hanged him without delay. This was the fastest British hanging on record, taking just seven seconds from the time that Inglis was removed from his cell to the moment that the trapdoor opened.  Dernley later related that Inglis practically ran to his execution, following the prison guard's advice to go quickly and \"without fuss\".\nInglis's execution is featured in the 2006 film Pierrepoint; although Inglis's name is not mentioned, the character \"Markovsky\" was supposed to represent him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HM Prison Manchester", "response": ["Twenty-nine hangings took place over the next twenty years and 71 took place in the 20th century, bringing the total number to 100.
