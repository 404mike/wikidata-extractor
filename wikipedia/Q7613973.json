When he became uncertain whether he would remain at Sauber for the 2006 F1 season in November 2005, he elected to rent a professional recording studio in Paris in order to better hear his music. Travelling to England to record with the Tenebrae Choir, Villeneuve recorded nearly every day for a month before stopping to prioritise motor racing. That same year, he released his debut French single, Accepterais-tu, and an acoustic rock album Private Paradise with 13 songs (nine in French and four in English) in 2007. Six songs each were written by Villeneuve and his friends; he also performed a cover of Women Come, Women Go by Gazebo. Villeneuve collaborated with vocalists Steve Smith and Am\u00e9lie Veille.
