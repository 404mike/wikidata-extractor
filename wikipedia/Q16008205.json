In the same aircraft he established a record in 1931 with a 41\u00bd-day flight from Karachi, India to Lympne, England, and in 1932 flew 8,800 miles across the USSR to Samarkand. He had asked his friend Bernard Shaw to lobby the Soviet authorities to grant him passage.He met the Lindberghs in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland in 1933. He was at that time attempting to fly solo to America in Rouge et Noir, now fitted with floats, but overturned on take-off. His next effort was in a Fox Moth named Robert Bruce. On his third try, Grierson successfully made the first London - Ottawa flight, at the same time making the first solo flight across the Greenland ice cap.Grierson served as an Operations Officer in the Air Ministry, and was a test pilot for Britain's first jet aircraft, the Gloster E.28/39, making the first flight of the second E.28/39, W4046/G, fitted with a Rover W2B/#110 turbo-jet, from Edgehill airfield on 1 March 1943, and of the Gloster Meteor F.9/40, making the latter's first U.S. flight on 15 April 1944. As a Wing Commander after World War II he was Deputy Director of Civil Aviation in the British Zone of Occupied Germany. He also worked as flight commodore for a whaling factory ship, Balaena, utilising two Walrus aircraft, and as an executive for a leading aircraft corporation in England.\nHe later lived in Guernsey where he kept touch with aviation by flying his own aeroplane and with polar flying, undertaking a flight to the South Pole in November 1966. He was a member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society and Britain's representative on Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1966. He wrote and lectured widely on early aviation, and on Charles Lindbergh. He died just after speaking at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum's symposium on the fiftieth anniversary of Lindbergh's solo New York to Paris flight.He is buried in the Churchyard of St Michael & All Angels church, in Offham, Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloster Meteor", "response": ["On 12 January 1944, the first Meteor F.1, serial EE210/G, took to the air from Moreton Valence. It was essentially identical to the F9/40 prototypes except for the addition of four nose-mounted 20\u00a0mm (.79\u00a0in) Hispano Mk V cannon and some changes to the canopy to improve all-round visibility.James 1971, pp. 304\u2013305. Due to the F.1's similarity to the prototypes, they were frequently operated in the test program to progress British understanding of jet propulsion, and it took until July 1944 for the aircraft to enter squadron service.Butler and Buttler 2006, pp. 23\u201324. EE210/G was later sent to the U.S. for evaluation in exchange for a pre-production Bell YP-59A Airacomet, the Meteor being flown first by John Grierson at Muroc Army Airfield on 15 April 1944.Berry, Peter. \"The Whittle/Rover W2B and Rolls-Royce W2B/23 Welland Turbo-Jets.\"  enginehistory.org.

On 15 May 1941, Gloster's Chief Test Pilot, Flight Lieutenant Gerry Sayer flew the aircraft under jet power for the first time from RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire, in a flight lasting 17 minutes. In this first series of test flights, a maximum true speed of 350 m.p.h. was attained, in level flight at 25,000\u00a0ft. and 17,000 turbine revolutions per minute.T.N.A. AIR62/42/198 Tests continued with increasingly refined versions of the engine.Flight International 13 May 1971, p. 678a. Small, auxiliary fins were added near the tips of the tailplanes to provide additional stability in high-speed flight.Winchester 2005, p. 83. John Grierson, in 1971, called these \"end-plates\" and wrote that their purpose was to increase the fin area due to the problem of rudder blanking in a side-slip.Flight International 13 May 1971, p. 679. On 21 October 1942, Sayer disappeared during an acceptance test flight in a Hawker Typhoon, presumed killed in a collision and his assistant, Michael Daunt, took over testing of the E.28/39.Grierson, ibid. The oil system had been changed before he flew; after it was proven, the aircraft was handed over to the RAE for testing by service pilots.", "The second prototype E.28/39 (W4046) \u2013 initially powered by a Rover W2B engine \u2013 joined the test programme on 1 March 1943. Flying of W4046 was by Gloster test pilots John Grierson and John Crosby Warren, because Michael Daunt was then involved with the F.9/40 (later known as the Gloster Meteor). Testing revealed problems with engine oil and lubricants. In April 1943, W4046 flew to Hatfield for a demonstration in front of the Prime Minister and members of the Air Staff.Flanagan 2017, p. 39. It was taken to Farnborough and fitted with a  W2.B and achieved 466\u00a0mph. On 30 July 1943, while on a high-altitude test flight, the second prototype was destroyed in a crash resulting from an aileron failure. The accident was attributed to the use of the wrong type of grease in the aileron controls; one aileron had \"stuck in position, sending the aircraft out of control\". The test pilot, Squadron Leader Douglas Davie, bailed out from 33,000\u00a0ft, suffering frostbite on the way down."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Welland", "response": ["Rover handed over a total of 32 W.2B/23 engines to Rolls-Royce as well as four \"straight-through\" W.2B/26 engines, developed by Rover's Adrian Lombard.

Stanley Hooker helped in the task of ironing out the remaining problems, and things soon improved. A flight-quality /23 was fitted to a Gloster G.40, an updated version of the E.28 that had flown the W.1, and was flown by John Grierson on 1 March 1943.
