He was born and died in Oldham, Lancashire.\nHe started his sporting career as a footballer and spent four seasons with Manchester City during which time he played 62 matches and scored 26 goals. One of those goals came in their 1956 FA Cup Final victory over Birmingham.\nAfter leaving football he concentrated on his cricketing career, which had already begun while he was with Manchester City. A right-handed batsman and handy offspinner, he made his first-class debut in 1954, playing with Lancashire. He earned his Lancashire Cap two years later in 1956, the same year that he had won his FA Cup winner's medal. In that season he scored what would be his only first-class hundred, 118 not out against Scotland. He also played in an unusual victory over Leicestershire as it was achieved without losing a wicket, with two opening partnerships of 166 and 66 between Dyson and Alan Wharton enough to give a victory by 10 wickets.Dyson was a controversial figure throughout his career, he was a free spirit and it ended up costing him his job at Lancashire. In 1960 the Lancashire committee charged him with \"a serious breach of discipline and an act of insubordination and insolence to the captain\".For the next two years Dyson played with Staffordshire and in league cricket. In September 1962 the Lancashire committee was overthrown and Dyson returned to the county for two more seasons, but was released again at the end of the 1964 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bert Trautmann", "response": ["During the previous final, nerves had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal, but the City team was more settled on this occasion. Under the influence of Don Revie who was outstanding on the day, City scored an early goal, a left-footed strike by Joe Hayes. Birmingham equalised on 14\u00a0minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3\u20131 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's Peter Murphy in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No substitutes were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15\u00a0minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. Trautmann admitted later that he had spent the last part of the match \"in a kind of fog\"."]}, {"page": "Roy Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["By the 1957\u201358 season injuries had taken their toll upon Clarke and first team appearances were sparse, though he became one of the first players to gain from a new benefit; upon completing ten years' service for the club he was given a cheque for \u00a31,000. After a pre-season game against Borussia Dortmund, which Clarke had played despite carrying a knee injury, manager Les McDowall informed him that he would soon be made available for transfer,Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p197 but an injury to Jack Dyson meant Clarke was retained for one more season.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p201 He made seven appearances in his final season at the club, the last in a 5\u20131 FA Cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion, in which he played centre-forward instead of his customary position on the wing. In total he played 349 league matches for Manchester City, scoring 73 goals. He had a brief spell as assistant coach in the latter part of his Maine Road career, but stepped down from the position to allow his former teammate Jimmy Meadows to take the position instead.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p150 In September 1958 he moved to Stockport County for \u00a31,500, where he played 25 league matches, scoring 5 goals.

Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a television audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through Joe Hayes, but Noel Kinsey equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3\u20131 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a bone in his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy. Due to his heroics, the game is often referred to as \"the Trautmann final\".", "In the fifth-round match, the teams saw out a 0\u20130 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at Anfield. Goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 2\u20131 lead, but the game finished in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's Billy Liddell was bearing down on goal. Liddell put the ball in the net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1\u20130 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1\u20130 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.Maddox, Saffer & Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, pp.\u00a045\u201346.", "|Forward ||10||Jack Dyson"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 FA Cup", "response": ["The final took place on Saturday, 5 May 1956 at Wembley and ended 3\u20131, with goals scored by Joe Hayes, Bobby Johnstone and Jack Dyson for Manchester City and Noel Kinsey for Birmingham City.
