After 18 more-or-less solo-produced issues, long-term supporter and helper Steve Moore was credited as assistant editor for issues #19\u201321, becoming co-contributing editor (with Phil Ledger, Stan Nichols, and Paul J Willis) on issues #22\u201326 and associate editor from issue #27. He was joined by contributing editor David Fideler, and subsequently (also as co-associate editor) by Paul Sieveking (#28\u2014 ) and Valerie Thomas (#31\u201332). Issue #20 announced that Kay Thompson (a staff member of Ley Hunter magazine, then under the editorship of Paul Devereux, with whom FT shared an address for several issues) would be helping to type parts of subsequent issues to further delegate the burden from Rickard. Moore, Sieveking, and he were also later joined editorially by author Mike Dash (who is mentioned as particularly overseeing the publication of scholarly occasional papers), before Moore moved from full editorial to largely correspondent duties for a dozen issues after #42, returning as a contributing editor in Autumn 1990 (#55).

Sieveking joined the FT team with #28 as co-associate editor, and writes, highlighting the intrinsic early difficulties in printing FT that that issue \"was printed by an Israeli entrepreneur in northern Greece and shipped to London.\" That issue (#28), bearing a cover blurb of \"Strange Phenomena\", featured an early advertisement for the bookshop Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed, drawn by Bryan Talbot, while the editorial promised that the next issue would not only see the availability of Index 1976, but also be in a \"larger and more professional format, typeset throughout, [with] better graphics, layout, and legibility.\"", "** Archaeology (usually by Paul Sieveking and Paul Devereux)", "Starting in the very early 1990s, Fortean Times produced a number of facsimile editions collecting the earliest issues of the magazine, in their entirety, including advertisements. These collections, prepared and edited for print by Paul Sieveking (including hand corrections to early typographic errors) are now out-of-print. Although demand was such to warrant reprints of several volumes, after collecting up to #77  FT decided that the previous volumes had not sold well enough to continue completely up to date. (Concern over the likely cost of reprinting issues in the new full colour format led to a publishing decision to stockpile 500 unbound run-on copies of each number to provide the basis of future reprint editions, and this project resulted in one further collection \u2014 Snakes Alive!, collecting #93\u201397 \u2014 but the in-between issues #78\u201392 have not yet been collected in trade format.)", "*Fortean Times 1993 Diary by Paul Sieveking (December 1992)", "*\"Fortean Times\" Book of More Strange Deaths by Paul Sieveking (October 1998)", "*\"Fortean Times\" Book of Medical Mayhem by Paul Sieveking and Ian Simmons (October 1999)"]}, {"page": "The Revolution of Everyday Life", "response": ["The Revolution of Everyday Life () is a 1967 book by Raoul Vaneigem, Belgian author and onetime member of the Situationist International (1961\u20131970).
