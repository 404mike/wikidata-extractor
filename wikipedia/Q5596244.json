He started the 2016\u201317 season well when he scored the opener and set up the third goal of the game, in a 3\u20131 win over Leeds United in the opening game of the season. However, against Preston North End on 20 August 2016, Onuoha scored an own goal to give the opposition side their second goal, as Queens Park Rangers lost 2\u20130. The following match saw him score his second goal of the season, making amends from his mistake, as the side won 1\u20130 against Wigan Athletic. However, in a 3\u20130 loss against Brighton & Hove Albion on 27 December 2016, Onuoha was sent\u2013off for a professional foul in the 56th minute. After serving a one match suspension, he returned to the first team, coming on as a substitute in the second half, and set up a goal for Pawe\u0142 Wszo\u0142ek, who scored the winning goal, in a 2\u20131 win over Ipswich Town on 2 January 2017. His performance attracted interests from Premier League strugglers Sunderland, but he stayed at the club. Over the season, his performance had been a subject of criticism, due to \"his inability with the ball at his feet\" and leadership. This led some Queens Park Rangers' supporters to call for Onuoha to be dropped from the first team against Rotherham United on 18 March 2017, but he proved them wrong when he scored the third goal of the season in a 5\u20131 win. Onuoha said at the start of the season that the club's objective was to challenge for promotion. But poor results throughout the season saw them finish eighteen place in the league. Despite this, both Onuoha and Grant Hall were praised by new signing Joel Lynch for their improvement in defence throughout the 2016\u201317 season, as well as, \"pushing each other on to greater heights in order to stay in the team.\" Although he missed two matches during the 2016\u201317 season, Onuoha went on to make forty\u2013seven appearances, scoring three times in all competitions. During the season, he was awarded the PFA Community Champion Award."]}, {"page": "Whitehawk F.C.", "response": ["*  Grant Hall"]}, {"page": "Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove", "response": ["*Grant Hall (1991- ) footballer"]}, {"page": "London Film and Comic Con", "response": ["| 26\u201328 July 2019|| Olympia||Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Zachary Quinto, Robert Carlyle, Hayden Christensen, Jason Momoa, Carrie-Anne Moss, Brendan Fraser, Tom Ellis, Val Kilmer, Jason Isaacs, Tom Felton, Ben Barnes, Christina Ricci, Gina Torres, Lana Parrilla, Emilie De Ravin, Karen David, Robert Patrick, Christopher Eccleston, Vladimir Furdik, Ian McDiarmid, Matthew Lillard, Lee Majors, William Shatner, Walter Koenig, Shazad Latif, William Zabka, Jacob Bertrand, Xolo Mariduena, Ian Somerhalder, John Barrowman, Alfie Allen, Jenna Coleman, Adam Baldwin, Gareth David-Lloyd, Lisa & Louise Burns, Michael Shanks, Billy Dee Williams, Erin Kellyman, Manu Bennett, Peter Serafinowicz, Finn Jones, Jeff Jarrett, Jessica Henwick, Sacha Dhawan, David Morrissey, Lennie James, Joe Thomas, Blake Harrison, David Naughton, Sean Biggerstaff, Devon Murray, Ethan Phillips, Nicole De Boer, Joe Flanigan, Ian Whyte, Julian Glover, Lourdes Faberes, Mike Carter, Gemma Whelan, Phil Daniels, Bernard Cribbins, Franco Nero, Sylvester McCoy, Daniel Mays, Colin Baker, Sophie Aldred, John Leeson, Jessie Cave, Rick Gonzalez, Kirk Acevedo, Rob Morgan, Corey Dee Williams, Curzon Dobell, Kailia Vernoff, Robert Picardo, Stephen Gevedon, Philip Zhao, Peter Purves, John Levine, John Simpkin, Rusty Goffe, CJ Graham, Annette Jones, Barbara Frankland, Tara Fitzgerald Robert Glenister, Kane Hodder, Hugh Quarshie, Jim Marlow, Leslie Easterbrook, Paul Blake, Nicola Bryant, Katie Purvis, Neil Ellis, James Jude Courtney, Martin Stephens, Lesley Scoble, Teri Scoble, Andy de la Tour, Jonathan Cohen, Rugero Deodato, Me Me Lai, Samuel Oatley, Quentin Pierre, Tony Allen, Derek Arnold, Tom Wilton, David Church, Syd Wragg, Steve Ismay, Alan Fernandes, Ross Beadman, Peter House, Anthony Cece, Guy Henry, Kerry Ingram, Andy Bradford, Pam Rose, Eileen Roberts, Ron Hone, Bill Westley, Peter Ross, Derek Chafer, John Cannon, Terry Francis, Vic Gallucci, Grant Hall, Francesca Ciardi, Nelson Hall, Aimee Garcia, Genevieve Gaunt, Jaime Hill, Alan Harris, Kelly Kelly, Rey Mysterio, Ted Dibiase, Al Snow, Rob Liefeld"]}, {"page": "Ryan Mason", "response": ["On 23 July 2013, Mason signed on a season-long loan for League One Swindon Town, joining fellow Tottenham players Massimo Luongo, Grant Hall and Alex Pritchard.
