Two days later in his first match, Shrewsbury won 2\u20131 against Walsall to reach the third round of the EFL Trophy; he was the first manager to win on his Shrewsbury debut since Graham Turner in 2010. He brought in eight players in the January 2019 transfer window including Tyrese Campbell, Ro-Shaun Williams and Scott Golbourne. In early 2019, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup. The club's cup run ended at the hands of rivals, and one of Ricketts' former clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Town were 2\u20130 up in the original tie at New Meadow with just under 20 minutes to play, but late goals from Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Matt Doherty took the tie to a replay at Molineux. Ricketts' Shrewsbury side went 2\u20131 up in the replay, only to eventually lose 3\u20132. A 1\u20131 draw away at Coventry City on 28 April mathematically secured League One survival for Ricketts and the club."]}, {"page": "Kevin Campbell (footballer)", "response": ["His son Tyrese Campbell is also a footballer who plays with Stoke City"]}, {"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["Due to the ongoing pandemic the 2020\u201321 season began later in September with matches continuing to played behind closed doors.

Stoke began the season well with Tyrese Campbell in decent form, winning eight of their first 16 matches and were just outside the play-off places at the beginning of December. However a number of injuries to key players most notably to Tyrese Campbell saw goals dry up and the team went nine games without a win at the turn of the year.

Inevitably Rowett was sacked by the club the following week. The Stoke board moved quickly to appoint Luton Town's Welsh manager Nathan Jones. Jones's first match in charge was away at Thomas Frank's Brentford. The size of the re-building job quickly became apparent to Jones as the Bees rushed into a 2\u20130 lead before Afobe pulled one back for Stoke, however Rico Henry ensured three points for Brentford. The buildup to Nathan Jones' first home match took a bizarre twist as Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa admitted that he had been sending members of his staff to spy on Championship opponents training sessions. To counter this Jones set Stoke up in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation with 19-year-old Tyrese Campbell given his first league start and Charlie Adam and Moritz Bauer returning to the team after being outcast by Rowett. Stoke produced their best display of the season against the league leaders, winning 2\u20131 with goals from Clucas and Allen, whilst Ezgjan Alioski scored a consolation for Leeds who had Pontus Jansson sent-off.
