Shipwright was only 23 years old but his record of serving throughout the war was noted.The Times, 19 December 1921, p. 7. He had begun a business career as a Director of Porthia China Clays Ltd. During his election campaign Shipwright's election address pledged him to a strong Navy, and a foreign policy which aimed at securing an honourable peace with a just settlement of reparations and war debts. In domestic policy he sought economy without decreasing safety and efficiency. The Liberal Party's national split was mirrored in Penryn and Falmouth with Sir Courtenay Mansel fighting as the official candidate but opposed by George Hay Morgan who was a former MP for Truro; there was also a Labour Party candidate. Shipwright won the election with 11,566 votes and a majority of 2,687 over Mansel. To celebrate his election, the ex-servicemen of Falmouth ceremoniously dragged his motor car up hill to the station when he caught the train to London to take his seat.See picture, The Times, 21 November 1922, p. 16.", "Shipwright made his maiden speech in a debate on unemployment on 8 March 1923. He attributed part of the blame for the state of unemployment to the miners' strike of 1921, and pointed out that every tin mine in Cornwall had closed down after that strike and had not reopened. He gave praise to the Conservative government for reducing the numbers of unemployed people and appealed for more faith, good will and confidence. His speech was received with cheers.\"Parliament\", The Times, 9 March 1923, p. 7. This proved to be his only speech before the short 1922 Parliament was dissolved and Shipwright was forced to face re-election. Unlike the previous election, the Liberal reunification meant he faced a straight fight with Sir Courtenay Mansel. Government proposals for the China clay industry, where mines in the constituency had been going through tough economic times, were thought to be a major issue.\"Rival Liberals in Cornwall\", The Times, 29 November 1923, p. 14.
