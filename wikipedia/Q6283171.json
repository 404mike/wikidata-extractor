The blazon, \"Gules bezant\u00e9e on a canton or a raven sable\", suggested to early writers a familial connection to the Houses of la Zouche (\"Gules bezant\u00e9e\") and le Corbet (\"Or a raven sable\"), but this connection has yet to be corroborated. It is possible that these arms were borne, rather, in feudal homage to these Houses, but again, this possibility is conjecture. The later recording of these same arms is shown here, by Joseph Foster in 1902, and suggests a slightly different blazon, \"Gules ten bezants 4, 3, 2, 1\" for la Zouche. This is actually a very common variation in heraldry and is noted so in the description of the arms on the page for Zouche.", "* Joseph Foster \u2013 Some Feudal Coats of Arms, J.
