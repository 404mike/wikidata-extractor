In recent years, Sweeney has established herself as a leading heroine, with the show centering on the popular and controversial relationships between Sami and her love interests Austin Reed (Patrick Muldoon & Austin Peck), Franco Kelly (Victor Alfieri), Brandon Walker (Matt Cedeno), Lucas Roberts (Bryan Dattilo), EJ DiMera (James Scott), and Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering). Originally characterized as the iron-willed daughter of Dr. Marlena Evans, Sami was transformed by writer James E. Reilly in the summer of 1994, converting the character from a stubborn moody teenager to a \"conniving bitch\", having her kidnap her baby sister, Belle and break up supercouple Carrie Brady and Austin Reed, including blackmailing Nicole Walker and Lexie Carver on numerous incidents. However, as ratings declined in the mid-2000s, Sami's storylines proved to be \"worn out\" and in 2006, new Days head writers Hogan Sheffer and Meg Kelly converted the character to a heroine by pairing her with EJ DiMera and later Rafe Hernandez. Recently, in 2013 head writers Christopher Whitesell and Gary Tomlin turned Sami back into a scheming vixen. With her son Will being tormented by Nick Fallon and her fianc\u00e9, EJ DiMera sleeping with Abigail Deveraux, Sami returned to her evil ways and culminated in her committing crimes such as planning revenge towards Abby and EJ for their affair and convincing Adrienne that her husband, Justin the father in law of her son, Will, was having an affair. The character has been described as \"vindictive\"; a writer from the American newspaper Asbury Park Press wrote that: \"she's so bad, she's good\". According to Austin American-Statesman in 1996, Sweeney had talked about \"longing to play a conniving troublemaker\" and she got her wish and more. Sweeney stated: \"It's kind of funny that I said that  I had no idea that (the writers) would take me literally\". Sweeney has said to have given a new word to \"manipulative\" during her portrayal of Sami. In 2005, Sami manipulatively created a male alter ego, Stan. During this period of time, from February to August, Dan Wells took over the role. Sami is known for her rivalry with Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) and Sweeney has said that Sami has never had \"female friends\".", "A bitter custody battle ensued between Lucas and Sami, who had a \"love/hate\" relationship over the years. Of the pairing, Sweeney said \"their past is such a deep relationship and ultimately a friendship and a trust that they have with each other.\" They ended up marrying, but it was \"permanently ended\" when EJ DiMera (James Scott) entered the picture. EJ, the son of longtime crime boss Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo), developed an obsession with Sami, and ended up controversially \"raping\" her.\"New Twist in Days' Most Controversial Tale\", Soap Opera Digest, week of July 17, 2007. Sami became pregnant and gave birth to twins; her daughter's father is Lucas, and son's paternity belonged to EJ. EJ had asked Sami for sex to save Lucas' life, while he was trapped and nearly died. This led to a sham wedding between EJ and Sami, in exchange for the DiMeras ending the fifty-year family feud between the Brady family. Although she initially hated him, the couple ended up in a \"night of passion\" resulting in another pregnancy. Of whether EJ or Lucas was Sami's \"true love,\" Sweeney said \"I personally think Sami and Lucas truly love each other, but obviously a lot has gone on between them that has pushed them apart. Right now, they are writing Sami more focusing on EJ.\" She also said that she enjoyed working with Scott, and called him \"enchanting.\" Of working with Dattilo, Sweeney said \"I am definitely a long-standing Lumi fan and I miss working with Bryan every day. He is so fun! I was in a scene the other day and looking around, like he and I have such a history together, for some inside joke and he wasn\u2019t on the set.
