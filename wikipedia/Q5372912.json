Williamson said, \"This result means everything, regardless of league standings, we want to be the Arsenal of old, the Arsenal that everyone doesn\u2019t want to play.\" As a die hard Arsenal fan, the win meant a lot to Williamson. \"I said to Mitch [Emma Mitchell] as we were walking over, as an Arsenal supporter I hope that they feel it, that I feel exactly what they\u2019re feeling watching this game. First and foremost I\u2019m a supporter of this football club.\" Joe Montemurro began utilizing Williamson on the right of a back 3 and after a 4\u20130 win at Bristol City on 28 October, in which Williamson assisted Jordan Nobbs for one of the goals, he said, \"Leah\u2019s really adapting to a bit more of a pro-active defending methodology. She\u2019s got a bit of freedom to go forward and I\u2019m really enjoying working with her. She\u2019s getting the rewards for the amazing work that she\u2019s put in over pre-season and the season so far, so all credit to her.\" Arsenal won their first 9 games and went into the match with Man City 6 points clear of their title rivals. By the time Arsenal faced Man City on 2 December, their injury crisis was such that they were forced to start 17 year old Paige Bailey Gayle in an injury hit team that lost 2\u20130 to a brace by Georgia Stanway. Two games later, a 2\u20131 home defeat to Chelsea which happened to be Williamson's 100th Arsenal appearance allowed Man City to move a point clear albeit having played one game more. On the injury situation, Williamson said, \"Obviously injuries are a factor and everyone can see we\u2019re down to the bare bones at the moment and it was before Christmas. But genuinely, we are not a team that makes excuses and it\u2019s not something we\u2019re talking about. We are focusing more on how to get the ball from A to B, for example.\" On the achievement of reaching 100 appearances at the age of just 21. Williamson added, \"It\u2019s funny, I was just talking to my mum and we said I could have done it much more quickly were it not for injuries. Naturally, I am always striving for more. In our meeting room at the training ground, the names of all the women who have made 100 appearances are on the wall and I look at some of the names on that wall and, without being too much of a fan girl, a lot of them are my heroes. It\u2019s amazing to be up there now in their company. But it\u2019s about the future for me too and the first 100 is amazing and especially at my age, I really do aim to get a few hundred more yet with this football club and in this shirt. This is more than just a football club to me. My family are all Arsenal supporters and they remind me every day that I am living a dream to play here and I hope that I have made them proud. Important day for me and them, I just wish we could have won\". "]}, {"page": "2015 Cyprus Women's Cup", "response": ["* Emma Mitchell"]}]}}
