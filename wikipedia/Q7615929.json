Traditionally, it has been common for players to agree to a \"grandmaster draw\" after playing about 10\u201315 moves of known opening theory and making no serious effort to win. This is usually done to preserve energy in a tournament, after a devastating loss in the previous round of the tournament, or in the final round when no prize money is at stake. There has been some debate over the ethics of the practice, and recently there has been a trend away from such games, with many tournaments adopting measures to discourage short draws. If the tournament officials (unlike those at Graz and Lishui) do not object, a game may even be agreed drawn without a single move being played. According to ChessGames.com, in the 1968 Skopje\u2013Ohrid tournament Dragoljub Janosevic and Efim Geller agreed to a draw without playing any moves. Tony Miles and Stewart Reuben did the same thing in the last round of the Luton 1975 tournament, \"with the blessing of the controller\", in order to assure themselves of first and second places respectively."]}, {"page": "Tony Miles", "response": ["Miles was often seen as a controversial figure. Once, in the last round of a tournament (Luton, UK, 1975), with Miles needing a draw for first place, and his opponent, Stewart Reuben, wanting a draw for a high placing, he agreed a draw without playing any moves. The arbiter decided to give both players no points for this non-game; the players claimed this \"game\" had been played often, when players prearranged a draw \u2013 this was the only time it had been scored 0\u20130, rather than playing out some meaningless moves.
