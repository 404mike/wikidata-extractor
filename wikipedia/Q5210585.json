Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence. Mariner Books This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which \"follow\" in some sense castrated bellwethers), and many others."]}, {"page": "John C.

The book claims that Buddha was badly beaten by his trainer, who clubbed him with an axe handle, and that an autopsy after his death suggested cerebral hemorrhage. Buddha's crime was stealing doughnuts from the craft service table. The book claims that the second orangutan referred to as being in the movie, Clyde Junior or C.J., was really just brought in for publicity during the marketing of the movie, as a result of Buddha's death.Dale Peterson and Jane Goodall, Visions of Caliban, pp. 145\u201346.

Designed in consultation with dolphin researcher and psychonaut, John C. Lilly, The Dolphin's Rune presented environmental messages as well as exploring the issues of dolphin intelligence and interspecies communication. The game was well received by critics and it has come to be considered an art game in the same vein as the earlier Lifespan. The audio elements of The Dolphin's Rune were especially singled out by reviewers as providing an essential element of the gameplay experience and achieving the high degree of player immersion that O'Neill had intended."]}]}}
