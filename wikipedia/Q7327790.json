At Newcastle Falcons he made 6 appearances for the Falcons the season they won the 1997-98 Premiership, and at Northampton he played in every game apart from the final for which he was a replacement (due to injury) in the victorious 2000 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Munster. In 2003, however, his contract with the Borders/SRU was terminated and he retired after he suffered a long-term knee injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of tallest people", "response": ["|Richard Metcalfe"]}, {"page": "Metcalfe (surname)", "response": ["* Richard Metcalfe, Scottish rugby player"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|942||MetcalfeRichard Metcalfe||style=\"text-align:center; background:#82C860;\"|lock||2000-04-02||v England at Murrayfield"]}, {"page": "2001 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Richard Metcalfe"]}, {"page": "2000 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Richard Metcalfe"]}, {"page": "Will Carrick-Smith", "response": ["Will Carrick-Smith (born 2 April 1992) is a rugby union player for Exeter Chiefs in the Aviva Premiership.
