He identified 13 species of fungi previously unknown in the British Isles, four of them new to science. He shared this interest with Beatrix Potter, who had often visited the area since she was a child, and they exchanged specimens and drawings. He left his collection of specimens, together with some botanical illustrations by Beatrix Potter, to Perth Museum and Art Gallery."]}, {"page": "Maoricicada mangu", "response": ["Maoricicada mangu is a species of cicada that is endemic to New Zealand.
