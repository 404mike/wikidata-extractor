He missed the start of the 2014\u201315 season through injury, and only made his debut on 16 September 2014 as a starter in Stevenage's 2\u20131 away defeat to Bury, in which he was substituted on 62 minutes. Beardsley's first goal came in a 3\u20132 away defeat to Portsmouth on 21 October 2014, after latching on to a Joe Devera back-header and scoring in the 74th minute. After scoring twice in Stevenage's 5\u20131 home win over Cheltenham Town on 15 November 2014 he endured a five-month goal drought, his next goal coming with a close-range 89th-minute equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw away to Accrington on 18 April 2015. Stevenage qualified for the play-offs with a sixth-place finish in League Two, with Southend their opponents in the semi-final. Beardsley started both matches, but Stevenage were eliminated 4\u20132 on aggregate, ending his season on 32 appearances and 4 goals. He was released by the club in May 2015, but was praised by chairman Phil Wallace, who commented that Beardsley had \"proved key to Stevenage establishing itself as a Football League club under Graham Westley\"."]}, {"page": "Ashmole Academy", "response": ["* Joe Devera"]}, {"page": "List of Latin Americans in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Joe Devera, footballer, Venezuelan father"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Joe Devera"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["!

In injury time, Luongo fouled Harry Forrester in the Swindon box to concede a penalty.  The spot kick was scored by Kevin O'Connor and the match ended 1\u20131.

The home side dominated the early play and went ahead midway through the half after Adam Rooney steered the ball into his own net from a corner.  Brentford doubled their lead in the 40th minute when Clayton Donaldson struck from the edge of the Swindon penalty area.  Rooney scored four minutes later to make it 2\u20131 to the home side before Donaldson scored with a chip early in the second half.  Joe Devera's 57th-minute volley made it 3\u20132 and in injury time Aden Flint's headed goal levelled the match at 3\u20133, and the aggregate score at 4\u20134.  Despite Swindon's Nathan Byrne being sent off after receiving a second yellow card for handball, the extra-time period ended goalless and the game went to a penalty shootout.  The first six spot kicks were converted before Miles Storey's strike was saved by the Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore.  No other penalties were missed and Brentford won 5\u20134 in the shootout to progress to Wembley."]}]}}
