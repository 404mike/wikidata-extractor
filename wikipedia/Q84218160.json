As a child, Allport received drawing lessons from her grandmother, the artist Mary Morton Allport who is considered the first professional female artist in the Australian colonies. Determined to pursue a career in art, Allport moved to England in 1888 with her mother Elizabeth and sister Eva. Initially supported by a yearly allowance from her mother and brothers, Allport shortly became financially self-sufficient through sales of her prolific works including oil paintings, watercolours, pastel drawings and relief prints. In Europe she studied with renowned artists including Hubert Vos and Charles Wellington Furse. In 1894, The Mercury newspaper reported that Allport was the first Tasmanian artist to have works exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts.", "link_mentions": {}}}
