Born in Chelsea into a high-class family and educated in Oxford, he first moved to Spain in 1830, where he travelled extensively and collected notes and drawings. Upon return to England, he wrote an account of his journeys in A Handbook for Travellers in Spain, first published in 1845, described as one of masterpieces of the travel literature genre. An erudite art collector, he befriended many important art and literature figures of his time. Ford was a skilled drawer himself, and made illustrations for his own and his friends' books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spanish cuisine", "response": ["For most of the 19th century, the aristocracy consumed a set of dishes that was largely an imitation of French cuisine.

Adkins and Linton's guitar work earned comparisons to early 1980s rock acts, such as the Outfield and U2. In contrast to Futures darker sound, Chase This Light was more melodic and upbeat. The opening song \"Big Casino\" channeled \"When You Were Young\" by the Killers. Adkins referred to it as a \"loser anthem\" for people who burn-out and desire success. He got the title phrase from a short story by Richard Ford where two of the characters are talking and one of them says \"He's big casino.\"Jimmy Eat World 2020, event occurs at 0:49\u20131:01 The pop punk number \"Let It Happen\" is aided by additional vocals from Ross. Adkins wrote it as a \"feigning strength as a defense\"-type track. \"Always Be\" utilizes finger snaps and handclaps; its melody was compared to the Shins and Shout Out Louds. It discuses co-dependency, alongside exploited weaknesses."]}, {"page": "George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex", "response": ["He had an illegitimate daughter, Harriet (1808\u20131837), who married Richard Ford (d. 1858) of Heavitree, Devon.

However, Murray practiced painting landscapes primarily when she stayed in Morocco and the Canary Islands. During her time in Spain she felt especially attracted to Seville, as did Richard Ford, a traveller and Hispanist who wrote about his travels in Spain and possibly gave Murray the idea to write about her trips. Murray was part of a group of travellers who, like herself, described Spain as a country with a lot of fervour and vitality, even as it was impacted by apathy and backwardness.
