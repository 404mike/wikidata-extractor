The war had changed Zyw, the shock and awe of brutal conflict as well as the realization of what had become of his family and homeland had engendered a serious stylistic change. These factors turned Zyw's art immediately inward and away from naturalism. And as he struggled for self-expression he produced a series of paintings featuring puppets and lay figures, symbols of helplessness and inability in the face of evil powers. This period did not last long however, and his travels back to Paris and discovery of Paul Klee had a direct influence on his art, and reminded him that painting was a positive and good creative effort, rather than purely an emotional outlet. His work in the 1950s saw him become a valued part of the Edinburgh scene, a scene which saw him exhibit with the likes of Anne Redpath and William George Gillies. In 1958, \u017byw visited the Venice Biennial and witnessed the Tachiste movement first hand, a movement which he highly disagreed with. The next period in \u017byw's art could be seen as a rejection against the autonomous and thick brush work of the Tachiste circle."]}, {"page": "List of museums in Bristol", "response": ["| Royal West of England Academy || 125px || Clifton || Bristol || Art || The Royal West of England Academy (RWA) is an art gallery. It was financed by a donation of \u00a32000 in the 1849 will of Ellen Sharples and a group of artists in Bristol, known as the Bristol Society of Artists, these were mostly landscape painters and many were well known such as William James M\u00fcller, Francis Danby, J.B. Pyne and John Syer. In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. During World War II the Academy became the temporary home of various organisations including the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the U.S. Army. It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function after the intervention of the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee. Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the Newlyn, St Ives and Bloomsbury Schools. Paintings by George Swaish, Matthew Hale, Anne Redpath, Mary Fedden, Carel Weight, Bernard Dunstan and Elizabeth Blackadder are also valued additions to the collection. The building is a grade II* listed building constructed in 1857. The interiors are by Charles Underwood and fa\u00e7ade by JR Hirst, altered in 1912 by SS Reay and H Dare Bryan. The first floor is in 3 sections, the outer ones articulated by paired Corinthian pilasters flanking large shell head niches with statues of Flaxman and Reynolds.

Her still life paintings with flowers - even though she also painted still life without flowers, as well as landscapes, seascapes and some portraits - are her most characteristic works. Armour learned from her contemporaries such as Anne Redpath and her close friend David Donaldson, and Still Life with Pomegranate is a fine example of her paintings of the late 1940s. During Armour's teaching at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s, she claimed to had learnt much from her students and their response to contemporary painting. As a result, her brushwork became freer and her colour brightened and became more vibrant. Armour and her husband often painted the sea at Blackwaterfoot on the Isle of Arran, and it was for these seascapes that she later told a friend that she would like to be remembered."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"R\"", "response": ["*Anne Redpath (1895\u20131965), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "Scotland in the modern era", "response": ["Important post-war artists included Anne Redpath (1895\u20131965), most famous for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects, Alan Davie (1920\u2013), influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, who moved further into abstract expressionism and sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924\u20132005), who was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.L.
