He was the centre of the Hampstead-based group that included William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb, known as the 'Hunt circle'.  Hunt also introduced John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Robert Browning and Alfred Lord Tennyson to the public.\nHunt's presence at Shelley's funeral on the beach near Viareggio was immortalised in the painting by Louis \u00c9douard Fournier, although in reality Hunt did not stand by the pyre, as portrayed. Hunt inspired aspects of the Harold Skimpole character in Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House.", "link_mentions": {}}}
