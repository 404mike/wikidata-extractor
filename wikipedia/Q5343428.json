He was the son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, and his wife Henrietta n\u00e9e Herbert.\nHe was educated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating as M.A. in 1806 and being awarded LL.D. by the same university in 1835.  He also became an honorary D.C.L. from Oxford University in 1844, the year he also became a Knight of the GarterAfter 1804, when his father was created Earl of Powis, he was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Clive, his father's second title. In 1806, he became a Member of Parliament for Ludlow, retaining the seat until he inherited the earldom and entered the House of Lords.  He was also heir to his uncle George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, who had died unmarried in 1801, and inherited the Powis Castle estates on condition that he assume the name and arms of Herbert only in lieu of those of Clive, which he did by Royal licence on 9 March 1807; other conditions were that he should settle his uncle's large gambling debts and that his father should leave the Clive estates to his younger son, the Hon. Robert Henry Clive.\nA defender of Church of England interests in Wales, in the Lords he led a successful opposition over 1843 to 1847 to a proposal to unite the sees of Bangor and St Asaph. He was ultimately appointed to a Royal Commission on English and Welsh bishoprics.  A sum of \u00a35,000 raised in testimonial to him was devoted to found the Powis Exhibitions to assist Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities intending to take holy orders.Powis had long service in the yeomanry within Shropshire.  In 1807 he was appointed major in command of a troop raised from Ludlow and Bishop's Castle towns, which merged into a larger South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry regiment in 1814. He continued under command within the new regiment, to which he succeeded as lieutenant-colonel in 1827. Succeeding his father as Lord-Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire in 1830, Powis played a leading role in the suppression of the Chartist riots of 1839, himself deploying four troops of his own regiment to disperse rioters from Newtown and apprehend some ringleaders while the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry were deployed in other parts of the same county. In addition to his yeomanry regiment, he was colonel commanding the Royal Montgomeryshire Militia from 1846 to his death.In 1812, as Viscount Clive, he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.The Earl was a bibliophile who built up by 1816 a book collection in Powis Castle sourced from travels in France, purchased partly from booksellers and partly from an auction of Empress Jos\u00e9phine's library at Malmaison. He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1828 and became President in 1835, the year he sponsored their publication of The Lyvys of Seyntys (i.e. The Lives of Saints).In 1847, he stood for election as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, but was defeated by only 117 votes by Albert, Prince Consort.\nAn encourager of canal building in Shropshire and into Montgomeryshire, he was at the time of his death Chairman of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company.On 9 February 1818, Powis married Lady Lucy Graham, the daughter of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, and they had seven children.\nThe Earl of Powis died on 17 January 1848 at Powis Castle after being accidentally shot during a pheasant hunt by one of his sons, the Hon. Robert Charles Herbert.

This was intended to provide funding for a new Diocese of Manchester. It was in the course of this campaign that Longueville Jones met the Rev. John Williams (Ab Ithel) and realising their kindred interests in Welsh history, literature and antiquity, led to their production, in January 1846, of the first number of the periodical which they entitled Archaeologia Cambrensis. The publication led to the expression of a desire for the establishment of an association to study Welsh archaeology. Longueville-Jones accordingly organised a meeting at Aberystwith in September 1847, and the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Association was then founded. He resigned as editor in 1849 on his appointment as Inspector for National Schools in Wales. Jones resumed as editor of '\u2019Archaeologia Cambrensis'\u2019 in 1855 and continued until his death in 1875.

He had funded his building and land purchasing schemes in part by a series of loans and the sales of life annuities, and in part by using funds that he held in hand as a receiver general of taxes for the counties of Brecknockshire, Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire.  He found himself in debt to the Treasury to the tune of \u00a324,618 and on 5 July 1816 the Treasury issued a writ seizing his entire estate.  The Mytton family hastily left for France.Humphreys, (2020), 54-59.  However, by the skilful use of Trusts, the family managed to retain Garth and most of its estate.  Particularly important to this was a trust deed of February 1827 which gave full control of the estates to Mytton's former college friend, lord Clive, later Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis.Humphreys, (2020), 62-63 After the death of Richard Mytton in 1828, his widow Charlotte - the daughter of John Herbert of Dolforgan Hall. - finally returned to live at Garth in 1840, and in July 1854 the trust came to an end with the overall burden of debt reduced to \u00a354,000. Her son, Richard Herbert Mytton now took up the estates following a distinguished career in the Bengal Civil Service, which he relinquished a year earlier. In 1856 he became High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire. His son Devereux Herbert Mytton succeeded him on his death in 1869.Pughe, G.
