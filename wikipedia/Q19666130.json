He went the full 90 minutes as the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Williams also started the club's first home match at Yankee Stadium, going 79 minutes of a 2\u20130 victory over New England Revolution before being replaced by Shay Facey. Williams traveled with the team to face Colorado Rapids, but was sent to the emergency room on March 20 and eventually diagnosed with viral pericarditis. Two games after his return, he then suffered an adductor strain that caused him to miss all but one match until July. On July 25, Williams was waived by NYCFC. He finished his spell with the club having made five appearances, all in MLS play."]}, {"page": "2015 New York City FC season", "response": ["| Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2015 || 1 January 2016 || DF || 58 ||  Shay Facey ||  New York City FC", "| 2 January 2016|| 30 June 2016|| DF || 58 ||  Shay Facey ||  Rotherham United"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Shay Facey", "| 2 January 2016 || RB ||  || Shay Facey || Manchester City || 8 May 2016 || "]}, {"page": "List of New York City FC players", "response": ["* Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|  Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|24||Shay Facey||RB||||Stockport||||15||1||Manchester City||5 January 2018||Undisclosed||2019", "| 24 || RB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|  Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|2||Shay Facey||RB||||Stockport||||42||1||Manchester City||5 January 2018||Undisclosed||2019", "| 2 || RB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || RB ||  || Shay Facey ||  Walsall || Released || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Walsall F.C. season", "response": ["| 2 July 2019 || RB ||  || Shay Facey ||  Northampton Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "Shay Anthony Facey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Shay Facey"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Walsall F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2020 || RB ||  || Shay Facey ||  Unattached || Released || "]}]}}
