Hits from 1979 included Who Is Poly Styrene?, La Dame Aux Gladiolas, a portrait of Edna Everage, and most notably the groundbreaking My Way, an examination of the appeal of the song, by Finch and Wall. It was the first of their collaborations, which developed a new kind of arts film, taking an unlikely subject and building a poetic meditation on its various aspects - further examples include The Chelsea Hotel (1981), The Private Life of the Ford Cortina (1982), Desert Island Discs (1982). Other successes included Megahey's portrait of Orson Welles (1982), Williams's study of George Orwell (1982), Yentob's portrait of Mel Brooks (1981) and Wall's four-part documentary on Slim Gaillard (1989).", "Anthony Wall, who has edited Arena since 1985.He joined the series in 1978 and became one of its leading directors.", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "| Anthony Wall", "|Anthony Wall"]}, {"page": "Your Mother Should Know", "response": ["According to film studies academic Bob Neaverson, the sequence is a pastiche of 1930s Hollywood musicals, particularly Berkeley's Gold Diggers series of films. In Greene's view, the sequence masks the sense of old-fashioned compliance in \"Your Mother Should Know\". He cites the entrance of the young RAF cadets, amid the throng of formally dressed dancers, as an example of the scene having \"a satirical undercurrent and [addressing] the fissures of late 1960s politics\". Film-maker Anthony Wall, commenting on the 2012 DVD reissue of Magical Mystery Tour, also recognised the sequence as a subtle satire of British culture. He said of the Beatles: \"All this Come Dancing stuff, the girls in uniforms, and coming down a staircase in white suits is kind of ridiculous, but they're also revelling in the peculiarity of it.\""]}, {"page": "Shake Keane", "response": ["In 1981, Keane moved to New York City, settling the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
