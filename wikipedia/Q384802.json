He also showed that the motion concluded in a finite-time singularity. His first theoretical hypothesis was contradicted by subsequent research, which showed that rolling friction is actually the dominant factor."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Keith Moffatt (Trinity)"]}, {"page": "David Crighton", "response": ["The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications and the London Mathematical Society instituted the David Crighton Medal in 2002 in honour of Crighton.
