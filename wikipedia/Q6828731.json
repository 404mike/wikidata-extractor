Nottinghamshire opted to bat first in the match, in which they were bowled out for 156; Basher Hassan top-scored for the county with 48 runs. During Leicestershire's response, economical bowling from Mike Hendrick and Michael Bore in particular helped them to restrict the total to 154 for nine; a two-run victory. They faced Lancashire again in the semi-final, and put in a good all-round bowling performance to bowl them out for 182. In response, a half-century from Richard Hadlee helped Nottinghamshire to a four-wicket victory, and secured them a place in the final."]}]}}
