In July 2005, the British and Polish governments jointly produced a two-volume study of bilateral intelligence cooperation in the War, which revealed information that had until then been officially secret. The Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources. This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organisations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France. A major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy. Liaison was undertaken by SIS officer Wilfred Dunderdale, and reports included advanced warning of the Afrikakorps' departure for Libya, awareness of the readiness of Vichy French units to fight against the Allies or switch sides in Operation Torch, and advance warning both of Operation Barbarossa and Operation Edelweiss, the German Caucasus campaign. Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons began in 1941, and Operation Wildhorn enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a V-2 Rocket that had been captured by the Polish resistance. Polish secret agent Jan Karski delivered the British the first Allied intelligence on the Holocaust. Via a female Polish agent, the British also had a channel to the anti-Nazi chief of the Abwehr, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris."]}, {"page": "List of spies in World War II", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Dunderdale, Wilfred\"|Wilfred Dunderdale || Dunderdale was a commander during the war. || Real 'James Bond' revealed in MI6 archives - Telegraph"]}, {"page": "Jade-Amicol network", "response": ["After serving in World War I, in the inter-war period, Arnould had been a military attach\u00e9 to Denmark and had been sent on various missions in Europe - he may have been a member of the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau. From the occupation by Nazi Germany and the time of the armistice of 22 June 1940, he continued in his official service role and was part of the :fr:Bureau des men\u00e9es antinationales. In October 1940, he met Father Antoine Dieuzayde at the Foyer Henri Bazire in Bordeaux. Dieuzayde was the Basque chaplain of the :fr:Association catholique de la jeunesse fran\u00e7aise who with Raymond Dupouy at the camp de Bernard Rollo in Bar\u00e8ges had a previous history of helping refugees from Francoist Spain. Dieuzayde's personal links with key staff in the employ of economic and railway transport concerns proved invaluable. Thus, Arnould had the support of Jesuits in the south-west of France, who thereafter provided safe lodging and connexions. With this foundation, he became the co-leader of what became MI6's 'Jade-Amicol' resistance network whose actions were centred in south-west France; the name came from the semi-precious stone jade, the codename 'Amiral' of the other co-leader, British-born Philip Keun  - and the nom-de-guerre of Arnould, COL, who was known as Colonel Ollivier amongst other codenames. Keun had French ancestry and had volunteered for the French Army. He had been captured by the Nazis but escaped from the prisoner-of-war camp at Cambrai in 1941. The definitive structure of the network was finalised at the end of 1941. The communications with London and associated logistics went through Keun. The network was directly associated with MI6 because Arnould had not wanted to join with General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces based in London. It was under the overall command of Major-General Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, the head of MI6, assisted by Commander Wilfred Dunderdale, a friend of Keun's father. While Arnould was in contact with the special services in the armistice army from the end of 1940, Keun had managed to infiltrate the Vichy Marine Intelligence Service. Initially, Jade-Amicol was linked with the Jade-Fitzroy network created by :fr:Claude Lamirault, a young Catholic activist. The networks split after a series of arrests between 1942 and 1943."]}, {"page": "Philip Keun", "response": ["Keun made contact with French resistance members and became an active participant. In November 1940, he met leading resistance member Claude Arnould. Arnould was a French civil servant, former diplomatic military secretary and sergeant in the French army from north-eastern France, who had been organising connexions based in the south-west of France, mainly recruiting through Catholic institutions and their contacts. At the same time, Keun became known to British intelligence and towards the end of 1941, the structure of a new resistance network was finalised. Keun had managed to infiltrate the Vichy Marine Intelligence Service. He was officially enlisted with the SOE and given the rank of captain by the British, also using the name 'Kane'. With Keun and Arnould as leaders, a new network was created with the name \"Jade-Amicol\", after the semi-precious gem and letters from Keun's codename, \"Amiral\", and one of Arnould's codenames, \"Colonel\". The network was under the overall control of the SIS; Keun's father was friends with Commander Wilfred Dunderdale a leading SIS officer and liaison with the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau (French intelligence service until World War II). A Paris headquarters was set up by Keun in the chapel of a hospital convent in :fr:Rue de la Sant\u00e9, which received refugees and allied staff. All air communications with the UK and within France were successful. Communications and logistics via London went through Keun. He spent most of his time in France but went twice to England."]}, {"page": "Claude Lamirault", "response": ["Angry at France's capitulation to Nazi Germany, he met by chance two British men - the Archibald brothers - staying in his parents' guest house; they provided an address in London. With two friends - engineers Eug\u00e8ne P\u00e9rot and Pierre Giran - he eventually reached England via north Africa and Gibraltar. Denise Lamirault remained behind, pregnant with their first child. An official at general Charles de Gaulle's Carlton Gardens base in London turned them away to seek help from the British. Through the Archibalds, they were introduced to the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Lamirault met Honor\u00e9 d'Estienne d'Orves, to whom he expressed his impatience to return to France. He was taught the basics of using cyphers and parachuting, officially becoming an agent on 30 November 1940. On the night of 11\u201312 January 1941, he was parachuted alone into Bracieux and commenced the task of creating a military intelligence network in France in the free and occupied zones. He revealed his role to Denise Lamirault, who then entrusted their child to her own parents and assisted in the Jade-Fitzroy network for the next three years. Lamirault returned four times to England, each time parachuting back into France. He developed the network nationally but with the centre of operations moving to Lyon. His deputy, :fr:Pierre Hentic, a fellow chasseur alpin and former communist party member who'd fought Action Fran\u00e7aise members in the streets, was in charge of air and sea operations, with transfers to and from England typically using RAF Lysanders and Royal Navy MTBs. Hentic was also in contact with Henri Bertin, leader of the Marne resistance, and Canadian :fr:Conrad Lafleur, leader of the Belgian network Possum, whom he befriended during training at RAF Ringway near Manchester. After an initial pairing between Jade-Fitzroy and the Jade-Amicol network of Claude Arnould and Philip Keun, they became independent again because of personality differences between the leaders, security lapses (resulting in a reproach for Lamirault from MI6's Wilfred Dunderdale) and arrests."]}]}}
