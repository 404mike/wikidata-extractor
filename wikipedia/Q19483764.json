She opined that the series offered something new and that viewers would not realise they would want a series like Doctors until they had seen it. Lush noted that despite its serial element, the premise of the soap meant that people could \"dip in and out\" since the core cast stays the same and the episodes are self-contained. Young echoed Lush's comments and said that he had wanted to create a daytime drama series for years prior to his involvement with Doctors. Young felt that the previously unfilled daytime slot would be good for the series due to more people beginning to work from home in 2000. Doctors was originally shown at 12:30\u00a0pm as a lead-in to BBC News at One. For a brief trial period in mid-2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7:00\u00a0pm, but due to rival soap Emmerdale being transmitted at the same time, Doctors suffered from low ratings, and was trialled in a 2:10\u00a0pm time slot instead.
