During the battle the French almost took his vessel, the ship of the line Bellerophon. Despite mounting casualties, heavy bombardment and the death of John Cooke, the captain of Bellerophon, the then Lieutenant Cumby ably took command, leading a charge that cleared his decks of boarders. He then captured the enemy ship from which the attack had come. He later served in the Caribbean and on convoy duties in the Atlantic. At the time of his death, he was Superintendent of Pembroke Dockyard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HMS Bellerophon (1786)", "response": ["Nelson mounted a loose blockade of the combined fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to be putting to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, Bellerophons first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS Mars. The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight of it on the morning of 21 October. The officers and sailors of Bellerophon prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words \"Victory or Death\" on their gun barrels. At 11 am Bellerophons signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal \"England expects that every man will do his duty\", and an hour and a half later Bellerophon entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column.
