He is nearly killed by his mother, Vallhallarama, while he deactivates dragon traps, and loses the map to her. He travels to a slave jail under Alvin the Treacherous's control to spy on Alvin. There, he finds and befriends many slaves, including his father, who now combs the beaches during low tide, looking for the Dragon Jewel. Alvin discovers Hiccup and makes him look for the Dragon Jewel by himself, with a deadly armed guard. A Deadly Shadow swoops down and snatches Hiccup before he has a chance to look for the Jewel. The dragon brings him to a hill to kill him, but notices that he has the lobster claw necklace.  They (the dragon has three heads, Arrogance, Patience and Innocence) tell him that they had promised to care for a Berserker woman's baby who was supposed to be killed by drifting through the ocean. They lost sight of the baby however, and as it happened, it drifted to Berk and grew up to be Fishlegs.  Hiccup admits he is not this child, and tells them of Fishlegs' fate (which was to be sucked into a hole in the ground).  He goes to this hole and gets pulled in to it by its inhabitant, a large dragon with an eye on each finger. His dragon instincts tell him that this dragon can't be reasoned with, so Hiccup plays dead long enough for the dragon to eat him up to the waist, which is when Hiccup stabs the dragon in a major vulnerable spot. He ventures off into the creature's maze of glass walls because of a mysterious voice and finds Fishlegs. He also finds the Dragon Jewel. Then they swim to shore through and exit, and the Deadly Shadow picks them up, all flying triumphantly into the distance. Cressida Cowell tells readers to stop reading there if they want a happy story. However Valhallarama finds Hiccup and takes him to the slave jail.  There she convinces the slaves and others to join Hiccup against Alvin by giving herself the slavemark and calling it instead the 'dragonmark'. The Dragons finally break into the jail and the humans flee. However, when Hiccup frees Toothless and the Wodensfang, he loses the Dragon Jewel to Alvin. The story ends with Hiccup happily being reunited with his human companions.", "How to be a Viking was recorded and released by Hachette Audio in 2014, narrated by Cressida Cowell."]}, {"page": "List of children's books made into feature films", "response": ["| How to Train Your Dragon (2003\u20132011) (series), Cressida Cowell"]}, {"page": "Blue Peter Book Award", "response": ["* Best story: The Wizards of Once by Cressida Cowell", "** The Wizards of Once by Cressida Cowell (Hodder Children's Books)"]}, {"page": "The Story Museum", "response": ["* Cressida Cowell as Peter Pan"]}, {"page": "Booktrust Early Years Award", "response": ["***Cressida Cowell & Neal Layton, That Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown (Orchard Books)"]}, {"page": "That Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown", "response": ["That Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown is a children's picture book written by Cressida Cowell and illustrated by Neal Layton, published in 2006.
