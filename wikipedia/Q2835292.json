The next several months were spent cataloguing and conserving the contents of the antechamber under the \"often stressful\" supervision of Pierre Lacau, director general of the Department of Antiquities. On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway and confirmed it led to a burial chamber, containing the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun. The tomb was considered the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings, and the discovery was eagerly covered by the world's press. However, much to the annoyance of other newspapers, Lord Carnarvon sold exclusive reporting rights to The Times. Only Arthur Merton of that paper was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to establish Carter's reputation with the British public."]}, {"page": "Mummy", "response": ["While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as Ptolemaic Greece, most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century. Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in pseudoscientific novelties such as mummia. The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in Cairo, Egypt. The first X-ray of a mummy came in 1903, when professors Grafton Elliot Smith and Howard Carter used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of Thutmose IV. British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of Tutankhamun in 1922."]}, {"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Alfred Lucas (1867\u20131945), Egypt-based English chemist and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Tomb of Tutankhamun", "response": ["The official opening of the tomb took place on November 29, 1922, with the first press report, in The Times, appearing the next day.

Carter and his team began work in mid-December, and removed the first item from the tomb on December 27. On February 16, 1923, the team opened the burial chamber. On February 12, 1924, they raised the granite lid of the sarcophagus. In February 1924 a dispute, caused by what Carter saw as excessive control by the Antiquities Service, led to a suspension of the excavation for nearly a year, with Carter leaving for a lecture tour in the United States."]}, {"page": "Chorlton-on-Medlock", "response": ["* Alfred Lucas, analytical chemist, involved in the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb"]}, {"page": "1867 in archaeology", "response": ["* 27 August - Alfred Lucas, English analytical chemist and archaeologist, part of Howard Carter's team at the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb (d. 1945)"]}, {"page": "KV15", "response": ["KV15 is known to have been opened in antiquity, as there are 59 examples of Greek and Latin graffiti on the walls.

To undertake this work, they established a makeshift laboratory in the empty tomb of Seti II located close to Tutankhamen's tomb.

The trumpets were played by a , James Tappern of Prince Albert's Own 11th Royal Hussars regiment. The recording was recently featured, and can be heard on the BBC Radio 4 program Ghost Music. Rex Keating, who presented the 1939 broadcast, later claimed that during a rehearsal, the silver trumpet shattered, and Alfred Lucas, a member of Carter's team who had restored the finds, was so distressed he needed to go to hospital. Due to their fragility, it is unlikely the trumpets will be played again in any official musical reconstructions."]}, {"page": "Ancient Egyptian pottery", "response": ["Pots fired in a firing pit often have a black upper rim. These black rims were increasingly a decorative feature, which required technical knowledge to produce consistently. In combination with a dark-red colour and polish, this black-topped ware was one of the most fashionable and popular types of pottery. The black colour was a result of carbonisation, created by the introduction of smoke particles to the oven during the firing process for example. Some aspects of this special process are still unclear.D. Arnold, J. Bourriau: An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery.

Callender's role in the excavation however remained key. Described by one of Carter's biographers as \"phlegmatic, unshakable, and remarkably versatile\", Callender was able to apply his engineer's experience to problems as they arose. He took charge when Carter was absent during the early days of the excavation, when the risk of theft from the tomb was at its highest. In December 1922, one visitor noted that, while a watchman's hut was being built, Callender stood guard outside the tomb \"with a loaded rifle across his knee ... sitting in the gleaming hot sun ... with huge beads of perspiration upon his uncovered and balding head.\" Once the excavation was fully underway, Callender's responsibilities included setting up the electrical installation for lighting the tomb, organising the transport of materials from the rail station to the tomb site, and assisting in the removal of artifacts. He also dismantled the shrines enclosing Tutankhamun's body and rigged up a pully system to remove the lid of the sarcophagus and the coffins inside. He acted as interpreter for at least one meeting with the director general of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities, Pierre Lacau."]}]}}
