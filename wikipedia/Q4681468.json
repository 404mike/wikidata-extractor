In the 77th minute, Elliott left the pitch to be replaced by Akinfenwa whose first action a minute later was to help win a corner for Wimbledon, from which Taylor scored with a low shot past McCormick.  The Plymouth goalkeeper made another save four minutes later before Reid came on to replace Wylde in the 83rd minute.  Hartley was then injured in a clash with Akinfenwa and was stretchered off the pitch, and replaced by Jordon Forster.  In the 90th minute, McCormick tipped away Akinfenwa's header to keep the score at 1\u20130, and the game went into seven minutes of injury time.  Tanner was brought down in the 95th minute but the referee ignored appeals for a penalty from Plymouth before Taylor's weak shot after a one-on-one with McCormick was easily saved by the goalkeeper.
