He has many other credits, including the 1998 series of The Wombles, and the second season of the Emmy-nominated Disney Channel/Dorling Kindersley series Amazing Animals. He has been associated with various companies, including Skryptonite, which he co-founded with producers Ken Anderson and Tony Barnes, and Corsham Entertainment, in which he was briefly partnered by Gary Kurtz, producer of Star Wars, and Richard Bazeley, a former Disney animator.

The project was originally conceived as \"BoneHeads of Voodoo Island\" by Christian Faber and Lego employees Bob Thompson and Martin Riber Andersen from a brief by Erik Kramer that was sent to outside writers. One of the writers who received it was Alastair Swinnerton, who rewrote the concept and was later invited to pitch it to the Lego Group at their headquarters in Billund, Denmark. The revised concept was well received and Swinnerton was commissioned to expand his initial pitch into a full 'bible'. On his second visit to Billund, the project was given approval and entitled \"Bionicle\" at an internal Lego meeting (a portmanteau constructed from the words \"biological chronicle\",Official Greg Discussion p. 198  on BZPower forums, post #5922 with reference to the word \"bionics\"). The names \"BioKnights\" and \"Afterman\" were also considered prior to the finalization of the brand."]}, {"page": "List of Bionicle media", "response": ["| Alastair Swinnerton, Henry Gilroy, Greg Weisman"]}, {"page": "Bionicle: Mask of Light", "response": ["The project was first proposed in 2001, during the original run of the Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A major part of the graphical design was adjusting the characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.", "Five different people were involved in the creation of the film's story and script: executive producer Bob Thompson, original Bionicle co-creators and writers Alastair Swinnerton and Martin Riber Andersen, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. The script-writing process began in 2002. Gilroy became involved after a meeting with Thompson, and enjoyed working on the script as he greatly admired the Bionicle mythos. Two draft scripts were originally created to see who would write the better script: one by Swinnerton, and one from Gilroy. Due to time constraints, the Gilroy script was accepted with some of Swinnerton's ideas included. Gilroy's most difficult task was creating the dialogue for the Toa: he needed to take into account Thompson's own interpretations, and what the majority of fans thought they should sound like. In the end, he attempted to stay true to original portrayals while giving the voice actors something unique to work with. He also needed to balance their portrayals and screentime, as each of the six needed a chance to shine. The script went through eight different drafts before the final version, although this was far less than Gilroy was used to seeing on other projects. During planning stages, a lot of time was devoted to how characters interacted with each other: cited examples were Lewa's style of speaking, and Kopaka's stoic behaviour. These traits were accentuated for the film to give the characters more distinction and depth. He also needed to avoid putting in out-of-context pop culture references, which would not fit into the setting of Bionicle. As part of the world and character development, expressions and exclamations unique to the world were created: a cited example is Jaller saying \"You could have been Lava-Bones\" when Takua narrowly escapes being killed by a flood of lava."]}, {"page": "The Baskervilles", "response": ["The Baskervilles is a 2000 animated children's television show about a British family living in the most twisted theme park in the world.
