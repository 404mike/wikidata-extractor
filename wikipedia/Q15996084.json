His only fifty came in Essex's victory over Kent in July 1910, when he made 71 batting at number three. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Dorset in 1905.\nHe spent most of his working life as a tea planter in Ceylon, where he was the superintendent of Diyagama Estate, Agrapatana. He captained Ceylon at cricket and served as president of the Ceylon Cricket Association. He played his last first-class match against the touring MCC in February 1927. He was highly regarded by the Ceylonese for his rapport with and care for the local people, and a cricket match, Sinhalese Sports Club versus A. L. Gibson's XI, was played in his honour in 1931 just before his departure from Ceylon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Archie Gibson "]}]}}
