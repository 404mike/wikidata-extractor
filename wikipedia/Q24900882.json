He is also known for his energetic live performances, in which he often conducts the audience to sing multiple-part harmonies or percussions.In 2012, his split-screen video covers of popular songs, such as Stevie Wonder's \"Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing\", began to go viral on YouTube. In 2014, Collier signed to Quincy Jones' management company and began working on his one-man, audio-visual live performance vehicle, designed and built at the MIT Media Lab by Ben Bloomberg.In 2016, Collier released his debut album, In My Room, which he recorded, arranged, performed and produced himself in the small back room of his family home in Finchley, North London. In 2017, Collier was awarded Grammy Awards for his arrangements of \"Flintstones\" and \"You and I\".In 2018, Collier began working on Djesse, a four-volume, 50-song album featuring more than two dozen artists and ensembles. The first volume, which features the Metropole Orkest, Djesse Vol. 1, was released in December 2018. The second, Djesse Vol. 2, uses more acoustic instrumentation, and was released in July 2019. In 2020, Collier won Grammy Awards for his arrangements of \"All Night Long (All Night)\" from Djesse Vol. 1 and \"Moon River\" from Djesse Vol. 2.

Natural 15ths are never notated as alterations or extensions, as they are enharmonically equivalent to the root.
