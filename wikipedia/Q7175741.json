Preston paid Ayr \u00a355 for the transfer, and McBride was given a weekly salary of \u00a33. On 20 March 1901, McBride injured a shoulder playing for the Anglo-Scots in the annual trial for the Scottish team. As a result, he missed the last five games of the season with Preston \u2013 his deputy let in 15 goals in those games, the team was relegated from the First Division and the club attempted to obtain compensation from the Scottish Football Association. In the 1903\u201304 season McBride kept 14 clean sheets to help Preston to regain their position in the First Division, winning the Second Division title with 20 wins and 10 draws out of their 34 games.\nOn 9 April 1904, McBride won the first of his six international caps for Scotland. He played against England four times, including Scotland's 2\u20131 victory in 1906. He was also a member of the Preston side which was runners-up to Liverpool in the 1905\u201306 season; Preston had the best defensive record.\nMcBride was known for his aggressive behaviour and it is reported that during one match, when the opposition's striker scored his third goal, McBride raced out of his penalty area and shook him by the throat.\nDuring his 15-year period at Preston, McBride played a record 443 games for the team. Failing eyesight forced him into retirement in 1912.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1877 in association football", "response": ["* 15 September \u2013 Peter McBride (d. 1951), Scotland international goalkeeper in six matches (1904\u20131909)."]}, {"page": "History of Preston North End F.C.", "response": ["Deepdale was enlarged to accommodate larger attendances as football nationwide increased in popularity.
