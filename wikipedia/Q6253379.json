That the estate had some boundary fence or bank marking it off from neighbouring land is suggested by a reference to a house, on the left hand side within the second gare, which contained two chambres for habitation. Some idea of the size of Pishiobury estate emerges from the long lease which Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton, granted to John Chauncy in 1400. The property then consisted of 319\u00bd acres of arable,  of pasture and  of meadow - houses and an orchard. In 1534, Lord Scrope, sold the manor to Henry VIII of England who granted it to Queen Anne Boleyn; an extend made at this time once again describes the estate. The perimeter of the park was nearly two miles; it was well wooded with game, deer and rabbits, and there was a lodge on one side for the keeper: could this have been the house within the second gate of 1343? There was a moated house within the park with stabling for twenty horses. The house was described as \"somewhat fallen into decay\"; it was replaced in 1585 by a new house built by Sir Walter Mildmay. Chauncy described it as a \"very neat and fair Pile of building for the Manor-house, upon a rising Ground in the Vale near the River Stort, lately converted into a Paddock for Deer, adorned in the Front thereof with a fair Bowling Green, raised about five Foot high, enclosed with a Brick Wall top with stone, and balls upon it, and two fair walks planted with trees; each walk extending about four Furlongs in length from the house to the road; where it is observable that there is no dust in summer, nor no dirt winter, a clear description of the setting of an Elizabethan house in its ground. The estate passed from the Gardiner family on the marriage of Rose Gardiner (1757-1835) (whose memorial tablet exists in St Mary's Church, Sawbridgeworth), daughter and heiress of Edward Gardiner (d.1779) of Pishiobury, to Jeremiah III Milles (1751-1797), son of Rev. Jeremiah II Milles (d.1784), Dean of Exeter. The house was remodelled or rebuilt by Jeremiah III Milles to the designs of James Wyatt in 1782\u201384.
