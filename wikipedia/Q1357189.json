When he had arrived in London, one of the first films he had seen was Shadows (1959), an improvised film by John Cassavetes, in which a cast of unknowns was observed 'living, loving and bickering' on the streets of New York and Leigh had \"felt it might be possible to create complete plays from scratch with a group of actors.\" Other influences from this time included Harold Pinter's The Caretaker\u2014\"Leigh was mesmerised by the play and the (Arts Theatre) production\"\u2014 Samuel Beckett, whose novels he read avidly, and the writing of Flann O'Brien, whose \"tragi-comedy\" Leigh found particularly appealing. Influential and important productions he saw in this period included Beckett's Endgame, Peter Brook's King Lear and in 1965 Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade, a production developed through improvisations, the actors having based their characterisations on people they had visited in a mental hospital. The visual worlds of Ronald Searle,Marlow meets Mike Leigh, Sky Arts George Grosz, Picasso, and William Hogarth exerted another kind of influence.
