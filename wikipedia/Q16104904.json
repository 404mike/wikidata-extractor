Also in 1972, as ITV commissioned the broadcast of the first nationally televised darts tournament with the 1972 News of the World Darts Championship, Baverstock asked Sid Waddell to accompany presenter Peter Jones and commentator Dave Lanning at the 1972 News of the World Championship, to observe the action and to look into creating a programme based on indoor pub sports. The result of this was Waddell creating The Indoor League, which ran from 1972 to 1977, with the first season shown only in the Yorkshire Television region and the following seasons shown across Britain on the ITV network.
