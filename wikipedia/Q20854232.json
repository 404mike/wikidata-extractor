The son of John Thomas Gammond (1892\u20131970), a clerk, and Margaret Heald (1898\u20131985), Gammond inherited his musical interests from his father, who was a skilful and well-known amateur cellist and instrument repairer.\nAfter early preparatory school in Weaverham, where he lived from 1930 to 1950, he was educated at Sir John Deane's Grammar School, where he attained distinctions in English and Art in the Higher School Certificate examinations. He won a scholarship to Manchester College of Art, having at the time an ambition to be a cartoonist, but at the age of 18 in 1943 was called up and served in the Royal Armoured Corps as a tank driver mainly in the Far East and India, ending with the 25th Dragoons, which was involved in the Hindu-Muslim conflict prior to Indian independence in 1947.\nUpon returning to civilian life in 1947 Gammond continued his studies at Wadham College, Oxford, until 1950, where he read English.  While at Oxford, he became well known in literary circles as a poet, appearing in three editions of Oxford Poetry, and as a cartoonist and writer with Cherwell. As poetry editor of the university magazine, The ISIS, Gammond worked under editors R. J. Harvey, Alan Brien, Robert Robinson, and Derrick Cooper. Gammond appeared in Oxford Viewpoint, where a study of his poetry by Irving Wardle was also published. During his time at Oxford, he composed and produced an operetta, Love and Learning, and played trombone in a university jazz band led by John Postgate.\nOn leaving Oxford, Gammond worked for a time in a West Country pub and as a rates assessor in Willesden, before joining the publicity department of the Decca Record Company in 1952, as an editor and sleeve-note writer, which led to his liaising closely with some of the leading classical and operatic performers of the time. He left the company in 1960 to become a freelance writer, critic and author. From 1964, Gammond edited Gramophone Record Review, later known as Audio Record Review, and remained as Music Editor when this was later incorporated into Hi-Fi News, until 1980. He died in May 2019 at the age of 93.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["When Sullivan turned to comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval.

He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.\"The London Figaro, quoted in Allen, pp. 49\u201350 Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores.

Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as \"a charming piece of nonsense\".Gammond, p. 36 The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by Herv\u00e9, shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat.
