One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including on the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington. Owing to the notoriety of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films about football hooliganism, including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od ju\u010de made an episode in which Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107 for qualification of the UEFA Champions League."]}, {"page": "The Great Game (1930 film)", "response": ["Much of the film is set in Chelsea's home ground, Stamford Bridge, and it contains guest appearances by numerous real-life footballers, including George Mills, Andy Wilson, Sam Millington and Billy Blyth.
