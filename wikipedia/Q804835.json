He was involved in the purchase and resale of the great French Orleans Collection of art, selling it on to a British syndicate, and owned a fashionable art gallery in Savile Row, London. His book, Biographical and Critical Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, first published in 1813\u20131816, was a standard reference work (revised, and often under variant titles) throughout the 19th century, and was last republished in 1920; however it is now badly outdated.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heinrich M\u00fccke", "response": ["* Michael Bryan, Bryan's Dictionary of Painters, C.

The artist is  said to have 'forged so precisely' in so many of his prints. It is common to see evidence of Dente's precision through his replication of arduously minute details of the master copy. Michael Bryan, in his Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, portrays Dente as a professional forger, with deceptive intents of his imitation. This portrayal has merit. Many of Dente's works were copied line by line; others have inscriptions and signatures that directly correspond to originals by Marcantonio."]}, {"page": "Karl Daniel Friedrich Bach", "response": ["* Michael Bryan, Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, i., London, 1886"]}, {"page": "Louis Boulanger", "response": ["* Michael Bryan: \"Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, biographical and critical\", London: George Bell & Sons, 4, York st, Covent Garden, 1886, p. 168."]}]}}
