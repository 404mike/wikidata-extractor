Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time."]}, {"page": "Hardwicke Rawnsley", "response": [" The classes, for men only, were held in the parish rooms near the centre of the town, under the supervision of Edith Rawnsley, assisted by a local designer and another professional from the South Kensington School of Design.Bott, p. 117 This led to the establishment of the Keswick School of Industrial Art.  It flourished and quickly gained a reputation for high-quality copper and silver decorative metalwork. By 1888 nearly seventy men were attending the classes. By 1890 the school was exhibiting nationally and winning prizes.\"The School of Industrial Arts at Keswick\". The Manchester Guardian, 5 April 1894, p. 8 To accommodate the increased numbers of students Rawnsley raised funds for a purpose-built home for the school, adjacent to the River Greta. It opened in 1894 and in 1898 a full-time head, Harold Stabler, was appointed, succeeded in 1900 by Herbert Maryon.Griffiths, p. 85 The school was mainly financed from sales of its products, and continued in operation until 1984.Bott, p. 119 For the women of Keswick and the district the Rawnsleys introduced spinning and weaving classes, led by Marion Twelves, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Ruskin.
