For the explorer, see William Dampier.Sir William Cecil Dampier FRS (born William Cecil Dampier Whetham) (27 December 1867 \u2013 11 December 1952) was a British scientist, agriculturist, and science historian who developed a method of extracting lactose (milk sugar) from whey.\nHe was born in London, the son of Charles Langley and Mary (n\u00e9e Dampier) Whetham and the grandson of Sir Charles Whetham, a former Lord Mayor of London. In 1886, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge and in 1889 commenced his varied researches in the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1891 was elected a Fellow of Trinity.\nIn June 1901 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His candidacy citation read: \"Lecturer in Physics. Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\nDampier was author of the following scientific papers, &c: - 'On the Alleged Slipping at the Boundary of a Liquid in Motion'; 'Note on Kohlrausch's Theory of Ionic Velocity'; 'Ionic Velocities'; 'On the velocity of the Hydrogen Ion through Solutions of Acetates'; 'On the Velocities of the Ions and the Relative Ionization Powers of Solvents'; 'The Velocity of the Ions'; 'The Ionizing Power of Solvents'; 'Report to the British Association on the Present State of our Knowledge in Electrolysis and Electro-Chemistry'; 'The Theory of the Migration of the ions and of Specific Ionic Velocities'; 'The Coagulative Power of Electrolytes'; 'The Ionization of Dilute Solutions at the Freezing Point' (a paper read before the Royal Society); an elementary text book on 'Solution and Electrolysis'; Letters and Articles in 'Nature' and 'Science Progress.'\" \nIn 1904 he published the first of his broader works on science and its history, The Recent Development of Physical Science.  This was followed in 1929 by his frequently reprinted and translated A History of Science, and its Relations with Philosophy and Religion.A Shorter History of Science. 1944,1945.\nFrom 1931 to 1935 he served as the first secretary of the Agricultural Research Council. He was knighted in 1931 for public service to agriculture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Land (economics)", "response": ["Some United Kingdom and commonwealth universities offer a courses in land economy, where economics is studied alongside law, business regulation, surveying and the built and natural environments.

George Clark (University of Oxford) initiated the session pleading that science has a truer sense of history than any other sphere of human activity. William Cecil Dampier then presented a hierarchical approach to the history of science. which he said should proceed from primitive emotions through law, economics, to science. This was followed by Thomas Greenwood (London University) who stressed the importance of understanding the history of mathematics in order to better grasp the history of philosophy. Archibald Hill (London University) then argued for more attention to the history of science in children's books."]}]}}
