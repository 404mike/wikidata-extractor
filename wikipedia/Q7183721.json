Philip Delamotte became an artist and was famous for his photographic images of the Crystal Palace of 1854. He eventually became Professor of Drawing and Fine Art at King's College London.\nOn 4 August 1846, at Paddington, he married Ellen Maria George, a farmer's daughter.

The new building, while incorporating most of the constructional parts of the original Hyde Park building, was so completely different in form as to be properly considered a quite different structure \u2013 a 'Beaux-arts' form in glass and metal. The main gallery was redesigned and covered with a new barrel-vaulted roof, the central transept was greatly enlarged and made even higher, the large arch of the main entrance was framed by a new facade and served by an imposing  set of terraces and stairways. Also the new  building, unlike the Hyde Park building, was elevated several metres above the surrounding grounds, and two large new transepts were added at either end of the main gallery. The building was modified and enlarged so much that it extended beyond the boundary of Penge Place, which was also the boundary between Surrey and Kent. The reconstruction was recorded for posterity by Philip Henry Delamotte, and his photographs were widely disseminated in his published works. The Crystal Palace Company also commissioned Negretti and Zambra to produce stereographs of the interior and grounds of the new building."]}, {"page": "1821 in art", "response": ["*April 21 \u2013 Philip Henry Delamotte, English pioneer photographer (died 1889)"]}, {"page": "1889 in art", "response": ["* February 24 \u2013 Philip Henry Delamotte, photographer and illustrator (born 1821)"]}, {"page": "History of photography", "response": ["Roger Fenton and Philip Henry Delamotte helped popularize the new way of recording events, the first by his Crimean War pictures, the second by his record of the disassembly and reconstruction of The Crystal Palace in London. Other mid-nineteenth-century photographers established the medium as a more precise means than engraving or lithography of making a record of landscapes and architecture: for example, Robert Macpherson's broad range of photographs of Rome, the interior of the Vatican, and the surrounding countryside became a sophisticated tourist's visual record of his own travels."]}, {"page": "1821 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 21 April \u2013 Philip Henry Delamotte, pioneer photographer (died 1889)"]}, {"page": "Delamotte", "response": ["* Philip Henry Delamotte (1821\u20131889), British photographer and illustrator"]}, {"page": "William Alfred Delamotte", "response": ["He was the brother of George Orleans Delamotte, landscape artist and teacher.

During the same year he started a partnership with H M Addey and moved his business premises to 21 Old Bond Street.

His partners included Robert Howlett (1831\u20131858) (famed for his iconic portrait of Isambard Kingdom Brunel), George Downes (1812\u20131877) and Philip Henry Delamotte (1821\u20131889) who, in 1853, held what was the second photographic exhibition in Britain and photographed the reconstruction of The Crystal Palace at Sydenham in 1854. Cundall is noted for his photographs detailing the construction of the SS Great Eastern between 1854 and 1856, and his portraits of Crimean Heroes in 1856."]}]}}
