His haul of five for 20 for England against New Zealand in 1984 was, for some years, England's best bowling return in One Day Internationals; it remains the best one-day figures by an England spin bowler. Marks was the first England bowler to take two ODI five-wicket hauls (having previously taken five wickets against Sri Lanka in 1983). This feat was subsequently emulated by the seam bowlers Darren Gough, Mark Ealham and Andrew Flintoff; the first spin bowler to equal Marks' record was Adil Rashid in 2019."]}, {"page": "Walter Lawrence Trophy", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| Mark Ealham"]}]}}
