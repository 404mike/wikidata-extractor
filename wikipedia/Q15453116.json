He was perhaps best known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy.", "Sir Aubrey had an austere appearance, captured in Ruskin Spear's official portrait of 1966.

For its first five years, the journal was published by the British Medical Association; subsequently, Cambridge University Press assumed publication. Shepherd favoured the term \"Psychological Medicine\" over \"Psychiatry\" and he attached great importance to the title which he resurrected from the Journal of Psychological Medicine, first conceived by Forbes Benignus Winslow. He defined psychological medicine as including not only psychiatry, but also the study of abnormal behaviour. He concentrated on original high-quality works across the wide spectrum of both psychiatry and its allied disciplines. Shepherd contributed extensively himself, investing much time and care towards the journal's success. According to his successor, Psychological Medicine was to become perhaps Shepherd's greatest and most enduring creation set in an already highly distinguished academic and research career."]}, {"page": "1989 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Michael Shepherd, lately Professor of Epidemiological Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, University of London."]}, {"page": "Michele Tansella", "response": ["Tansella received his M.D. from the University of Bari in 1966, after which he began working at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, Italy.
