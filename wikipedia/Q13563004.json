In March 1972 she obtained her Ph.D., also from Cambridge, for a thesis entitled Andr\u00e9 Malraux: A Study of a Novelist. After marrying, she emigrated to the United States and taught at Northeastern University, Wellesley, Harvard, and Yale, where she was a fellow of Jonathan Edwards College and director of the Women's Studies Program.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Virginia Woolf", "response": ["Though at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lee's 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolf's life and work, which she discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001, Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. Julia Briggs's Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life (2005) focuses on Woolf's writing, including her novels and her commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses Woolf's literature to understand and analyse gender domination. Woolf biographer Gillian Gill notes that Woolf's traumatic experience of sexual abuse by her half-brothers during her childhood influenced her advocacy of protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences."]}, {"page": "Phineas Parkhurst Quimby", "response": ["Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was a patient of Quimby's for a short time.

Eddy described her problems with food in the first edition of Science and Health (1875). She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread, and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: \"Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation.\"Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health, 1st edition, Christian Science Publishing Company, 1875, 189\u2013190.", "Phineas Quimby died on January 16, 1866, shortly after Eddy's father.

Eddy had agreed to form a partnership with Kennedy in 1870, in which she would teach him how to heal, and he would take patients.Gill, 1998, pp. 188, 192. The partnership was rather successful at first, but by 1872 Kennedy had fallen out with his teacher and torn up their contract.Gill, 1998, pp. 192, 201. Although there were multiple issues raised, the main reason for the break according to Gill was Eddy's insistence that Kennedy stop \"rubbing\" his patient's head and solar plexus, which she saw as harmful since, as Gill states, \"traditionally in mesmerism or hypnosis the head and abdomen were manipulated so that the subject would be prepared to enter into trance.\"Gill, 1998, p. 202.

Psychoanalyst Julius Silberger argues the truth is probably somewhere in-between, and that it clearly did have some effect on her, since her life and actions were \"startlingly different\" before and after the event.Silberger 1980, 98-100.

She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the \"stranger harboured in our country\" and the \"evil counsellors\" surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a \"certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora was to be the first victim,\" a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply \"held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign.\" As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been \"converted\" to the Whig party, and that she had been offered \"an urgent proposal of marriage\" by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, the historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. The historian K. D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive, however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen."]}, {"page": "Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom", "response": ["Conversely, Anthony Camp challenges the belief that Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes of the possibility that the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but there is no evidence to back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia."]}, {"page": "Christian Science (book)", "response": ["Gillian Gill, a biographer of Mary Baker Eddy, has argued that Twain was \"ambivalent\" towards Christian Science, and that passages of the essay were in fact \"pretty unambiguously pro-CS.\" In response Caroline Fraser writes that Gill has misread the text, and that Twain praised Christian Science \"in the most backhanded and ironic way.\" Fraser writes that whatever Twain's view of Christian Science, his view of Eddy herself was overwhelmingly hostile.Gillian Gill; reply by Caroline Fraser, \"Mrs. Eddy\u2019s Voices\", The New York Review of Books, June 29, 2000.
