She was generally well received by critics, described as a national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, an old-fashioned spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s.", "In 1973, Mavis starts dating the equally shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), but it remains platonic. Jerry dies of a heart attack in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets salesman Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek\u00a0\u2013 feeling the same way she does\u00a0\u2013 did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in November 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.", "A spinster for many years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often too shy to allow dating to progress beyond the initial stages of courtship. Ian Randall comments that \"Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species\". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), but it was more than a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, \"She [Mavis] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with [the wedding], and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [where Rita supports her decision to jilt Derek] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [were] great friends, all the way through.\"", "Richard Dyer perceives the Mavis and Derek characters to be as \"shy physically\" as one another, whereas Kathryn Hone, writing in The Sunday Times, considers Derek \"even more dithering than Mavis\".

Actors Thelma Barlow and Peter Baldwin had worked together before their casting as Derek and Mavis, and the two became close friends.", "Barlow decided to leave the role of Mavis in 1997, having played it for 26 years. It was reported that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin, who played her screen husband Derek Wilton. At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off-screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer, Brian Park, dubbed \"the axeman\" in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast. The actress Jean Alexander, who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial, went to the press in protest at the news. She wrote: \"Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple, but they've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave. Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita.\" Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme-makers that \"Derek and Mavis had had their day\". Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek as a result of her own desire to leave. She said: \"It was sort of cruel, really; I mean, they could have killed Mavis off. It was a new director and a new producer, and they wanted to make a big news splash. It was very hard for Peter [who played Derek].\" The village of Cartmel, near Grange-over-Sands, enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis's storyline.", "The character received various accolades over the years. At the TV Times \"Corrie Awards\", Mavis and Derek were nominated for \"Best Couple\", and Susannah Clapp listed Mavis in The Observer's \"10 best Coronation Street characters\" list. Clapp said \"Thelma Barlow played [Mavis], with exceptional delicacy, in a variety of pastel pinnies, for 26\u00a0years.\" She concluded that she had a \"tumultuous relationship with her soulmate, Derek\". When Barlow quit the role as Mavis in 1997, various Coronation Street stars praised her contribution: Sherrie Hewson (who played Maureen Holdsworth) said \"Thelma's a wonderful lady and a superb actress. We'll miss her\"; Michael Le Vell (Kevin Webster) said \"Thelma's quality as an actress shone through for everyone to see after the death of Derek\"; Peter Baldwin (Derek) said \"It has made a difference to the programme and the departure of Derek and now Mavis is going to upset a lot of viewers\"."]}, {"page": "Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)", "response": ["Throughout his time on the show, Alan exhibits a volatile and temperamental streak due to his psychopathic nature.
