The eccentric bookseller John Dunton, from whom our only knowledge of him is derived, has left a flattering account of his abilities.  Dunton wrote \"His genius was quite above the common order, and his style was incomparably fine. \u2026 He wrote for me the parable of the magpies, and many thousands of them sold\".\nBradshaw lived in poverty and debt, and under the additional burden of a melancholy temperament. Dunton's last experience of him was in connection with a literary project for which he furnished certain material equipments; possessed of these, Bradshaw disappeared. The passage in which Dunton records this transaction has all his characteristic na\u00efvet\u00e9, though it may be doubted whether, if Bradshaw lived to read it, he derived much satisfaction from the plenary dispensation which was granted him \u2014 \"If Mr. Bradshaw be yet alive, I here declare to the world and to him that I freely forgive him what he owes both in money and books if he will only be so kind as to make me a visit\". Dunton believed Bradshaw to be the author of the Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy , but this conjecture is negatived by counter claims supported on better authority.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Bradshaw", "response": ["*William Bradshaw (Puritan) (1571\u20131618), English Puritan", "*William Bradshaw (MP), Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1604 to 1611", "*William Bradshaw (writer) ( 1700), British hack writer", "*William Bradshaw (bishop) (1671\u20131732), bishop of Bristol", "*William Bradshaw (cabinetmaker), 18th century British cabinet-maker", "*William Bradshaw (VC) (1830\u20131861), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*William Bradshaw (footballer) (1882\u2013?), English footballer with Arsenal, Fulham, Burton United & Burnley", "*William Bradshaw, Baron Bradshaw (born 1936), British academic and politician", "*William Bradshaw (British Army officer) (1897\u20131966)"]}, {"page": "Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy", "response": ["It is agreed that the first volume of this work was written by Giovanni Paolo Marana (1642\u20131693), a Genoese political refugee to the French court of Louis XIV.Paula R.

They have been attributed to many writers, most notably Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw, who produced the English translation.Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture, page 58 However, given the similarities between the letters, and the stylistic coherence of the whole series, the likeliest author is Marana himself.Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, Fabulous orients: fictions of the East in England, 1662-1785, page 145 Marana may have had difficulty in getting the later volumes published in France and turned to England to secure their continuing appearance."]}]}}
