His work spans journalism, fiction, essays, memoir and over fifty highly idiosyncratic television films, and has been described as \"brainy, scabrous, mischievous,\" \"iconoclastic\" and possessed of \"a polymathic breadth of knowledge and truly caustic wit\".His latest book, an anthology of uncollected writing from 1988 to 2020 titled Pedro and Ricky Come Again, was published by Unbound in March 2021 and is the sequel to Peter Knows What Dick Likes. His most recent film, Franco Building with Jonathan Meades, aired on BBC Four in August 2019 and is the fourth instalment in a series on the architectural legacy of 20th-century European dictators.He has described himself as a \"cardinal of atheism\" and is both an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Patron of Humanists UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portsmouth", "response": ["Portsmouth is the hometown of Fanny Price, the main character of Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, and most of its closing chapters are set there.
