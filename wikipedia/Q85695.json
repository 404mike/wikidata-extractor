J. P. Taylor", "response": ["Taylor's first book, published in 1934, addressed the question of Italian unification The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847\u201349. However, Taylor's speciality was in Central European, British and diplomatic history. He was especially interested in the Habsburg dynasty and Bismarck. His main mentors in this period were the Austrian-born historian Alfred Francis Pribram and the Polish-born historian Sir Lewis Namier. Taylor's earlier writings reflected Pribram's favourable opinion of the Habsburgs; however, his 1941 book The Habsburg Monarchy 1809\u20131918 (published in a revised edition in 1948) showed the influence of Namier's unfavourable views. In The Habsburg Monarchy, Taylor stated that the Habsburgs saw their realms entirely as a tool for foreign policy and thus could never build a genuine nation-state. To hold their realm together, they resorted to playing one ethnic group off against another and promoted German and Magyar hegemony over the other ethnic groups in Austria-Hungary."]}, {"page": "List of Jewish historians", "response": ["*Alfred Francis Pribram (de), Anglo-Austrian diplomatic historian.Almanach f\u00fcr das Jahr 1949, 99.
