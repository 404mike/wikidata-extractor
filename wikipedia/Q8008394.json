Edmeads made one known first-class appearance, scoring 15 runs with a highest innings of 13. He did not bowl but held two catches. He was the younger brother of John Edmeads.\nAs Edmeads had established his reputation by 1775, he must have been active for some years previously and his career may have begun in the 1760s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Edmeads.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1775 English cricket season", "response": ["* William Edmeads (Surrey)"]}, {"page": "Edmeads, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Edmeads"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Played 17 first-class matches, most frequently for Surrey sides.
