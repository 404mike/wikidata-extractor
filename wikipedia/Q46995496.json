It begins with a montage of pencil drawings in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero (played by Morten Harket) is pursued by two opponents, played by Philip Jackson and Alfie Curtis. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey is reading the comic book. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her coffee and the bill.
