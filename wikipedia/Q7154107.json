He previously played for Football League Two club Luton Town.\nUnderwood began his career with Carshalton Athletic, and after spells at Sutton United, Dorking and Molesey, he moved to Enfield. After a year at Enfield he joined Rushden & Diamonds for \u00a350,000 in the summer of 1997. He made over 200 appearances during his time at Nene Park, and during this period he captained the club in the Football Conference and Football League Two title-winning campaigns.\nUnderwood was signed by Luton Town in March 2004, but was injured just 19 minutes into his debut \u2013 two days after joining the club. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the 2003\u201304 season.\nHe had a superb season during the 2004\u201305 campaign as the Hatters won the Football League One Championship, with Underwood playing mainly on the left-wing. The 2005\u201306 season saw Underwood used as a utility player, operating at left-back, left midfield, central midfield and central defence as Luton finished a respectable 10th in The Championship.\nUnderwood suffered massively during the 2006\u201307 season in The Championship, as a routine knee operation during the pre-season period caused a blood infection, leading to Underwood losing over two stone in weight. The effects forced him to miss the entire season, and he had to watch from the sidelines as Luton were relegated.\nDespite not playing a game the previous season, Underwood had shown enough ability during his two years at Kenilworth Road to persuade then Hatters boss Mike Newell to give him a new two-year contract, which he duly signed, keeping him at Luton until the summer of 2009.Underwood, however, never made a full recovery from his illness, and spent his last two seasons without playing a single game for Luton. On 1 October 2008, Underwood opted to leave Luton Town owing to injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rushden & Diamonds F.C.", "response": ["The 2003\u201304 season in Division Two proved to be one of difficulty for Rushden & Diamonds. Despite a promising early start, a run of bad results over the winter period saw the club slip down the table, and in March 2004 Brian Talbot left the club after seven years as manager. The transfer window saw star players Paul Underwood, Onandi Lowe, Paul Hall and Marcus Bignot all depart as off the pitch problems mounted, and the club severely struggled for the remainder of the season. Barry Hunter took over as caretaker player-manager but they were relegated in 22nd place after losing their last three games of the season.", "| Paul Underwood"]}, {"page": "Steve Jones (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["Jones was called up to the England C national side in March 2001 after showing good form for Leigh RMI in the Conference.

On 22 March, Jones started the 3\u20130 win against the Netherlands, however he had to come off after just 18-minutes after failing to fully recover from a bout of food poisoning.

Justin Edinburgh, caretaker manager, was given the job until the end of the season. Within the space of a few games, Edinburgh breathed new life in the club as for the first time in years, the team began to play with an air of self-confidence and without fear. As well as a successful start to his RDFC managing career, (earning ten points from a possible fifteen in his first five games), the standard of play and the overall entertainment value rose dramatically, with several players rediscovering performances that some had not brought forth in years. A 1\u20130 win over rivals Kettering merely heightened this sense of relief and recovery. The season ended with a 3\u20131 win over already-relegated Woking FC. The result ensured their final position as 11th, their highest finish in a league table since the Division 3 title was won in 2003. The season also ended pleasantly with the knowledge that nearly 1,000 extra people had visited Nene Park that season for league games, seeing a rise in the average league attendance for the first time in years."]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["The end of the month also saw the closure of the transfer window, and the club released striker Dean Crowe, who had made only two starts all season.
