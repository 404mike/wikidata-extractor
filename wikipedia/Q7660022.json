Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health, and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors."]}, {"page": "Last of the Summer Wine", "response": ["Every episode of Last of the Summer Wine was written by Roy Clarke.

Beckinsale expressed relief at landing the role, owing to his concern about being typecast as Geoffrey from The Lovers. Barker had suggested actor Paul Henry for the role of Godber, owing to Henry\u2019s being from Birmingham (as Godber was meant to be), but director Sydney Lotterby chose Beckinsale instead.

The show was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents.

By the time James was available again, Pauline Collins had moved to LWT's Upstairs, Downstairs. The producer Sydney Lotterby remembered having worked with Nerys Hughes on The Likely Lads and, wrongly believing the Welsh actress was from Liverpool, asked her to read for a part in The Liver Birds. (Neither actress really had a Liverpool accent: James was from Oswaldtwistle,\"Liverpool birds\", Radio Times, 5\u201311 February 1972 near Blackburn, and Hughes was from Rhyl.) Impressed with Hughes' reading, he offered her the part of Sandra, and the new series, in colour, began. The first episode of the second series aired on 7 January 1971. The actresses got on well together. \"The rapport between Polly and myself was fairly instant. It was excellent. It happened in a twinkling really.\" said Hughes later, and James added, \"We just fitted together.

With 13 episodes commissioned for the third series, Michael Mills felt that the writing duties would be too much for Lane to handle alone, so he handed six episodes to the writing duo of Jack Seddon and David Pursall. \"They wrote like fellas. They had no idea how a woman thought\", Lane said later, and Nerys Hughes observed, \"They weren't empathetic, they were...voyeuristic!\" \"They were, tonally, not the same\", conceded the producer, Sydney Lotterby.

In 1971 he'd replaced Pauline Collins with Nerys Hughes, and Hughes herself spotted her potential new flatmate: 'I went to see a musical in town--Willy Russell's, John, Paul, George, Ringo..and Bert, and saw Elizabeth Estensen.' Lotterby saw the performance at Hughes' suggestion, and asked Estensen to audition for the part. 'She was loud, and abrasive, and exactly what I wanted,' said Lotterby. So Beryl, the bouncy blonde, was replaced by feisty, flame-haired Carol.Comedy Connections BBCtv Now into the fifth series, Carla Lane expanded her range from single life to family life and introduced Carol's relatives: the Boswells. \"They were a close family\u2014they were a dysfunctional family\" said Estensen, and they included Carol's brother Lucien, played by native-Liverpudlian Michael Angelis; her father Mr. Boswell played by Ray Dunbobbin; and her mother Mrs. Boswell played initially by Eileen Kennally and later Carmel McSharry.
