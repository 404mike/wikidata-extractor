It then passed to the Wase family and became known as Hinton Wase. In 1365 Nicholas Wase sold the manor to William Wroughton (died 1392), whose family then held Broad Hinton until 1628 when Sir Giles Wroughton sold it to Sir John Glanville, MP and later Speaker of the House of Commons. He was a cousin of John Evelyn's wife, and the diarist visited him at Broad Hinton in 1654, noting that he was living in the manor's gatehouse because he had burnt down his home to prevent the Roundheads setting up a garrison there during the Civil War. In 1709 a later John Glanville sold the manor to Thomas Bennet, from whom it descended via the female line through the Legh, Keck and Calley families. In 1839 James Calley sold Broad Hinton to the Duke of Wellington. In 1867 his son the 2nd Duke of Wellington sold Broad Hinton to N. Story-Maskelyne, who in 1869 sold it on to the former MP Sir Henry Meux, 2nd Baronet.
