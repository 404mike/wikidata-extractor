Duke first received broad public attention during this time, as he endeavored to market himself in the mid-1970s as a new brand of Klansman: well-groomed, engaged, and professional. Duke also reformed the organization, promoting nonviolence and legality, and, for the first time in the Klan's history, women were accepted as equal members and Catholics were encouraged to apply for membership. Duke would repeatedly insist that the Klan was \"not anti-black\" but rather \"pro-white\" and \"pro-Christian\".  Duke told the British Daily Telegraph newspaper that he left the Klan in 1980 because he disliked its associations with violence and could not stop the members of other Klan chapters from doing \"stupid or violent things\". It was asserted by Julia Reed in The New York Review of Books in April 1992 that Duke was forced to leave the Klan after selling a copy of its membership records to a rival Klan leader who was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informer."]}, {"page": "Bridget Maasland", "response": ["For a more universal audience, she interviewed the teams in both series of the Dutch version of Robot Wars (the role Philippa Forrester and, when she was off, Julia Reed and Jayne Middlemiss, had in the main (UK) version of the Robot Combat gameshow).
