At the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, he won the 800 m, finishing 15 metres clear of Tom McKean and Peter Elliott in 1:43:22 - still the Commonwealth Games record. He followed this up with gold in the 1500 m and was persuaded to run both events at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart. He arrived at the European Championships \"just over the edge\" as he suggested in David Miller's biography of Coe, \"Born to Run\". Nevertheless, he won the bronze in the 800 m having been blocked down the back straight by Tom McKean who made his run at the same time as Cram and, though leading into the straight, lacked the zest he showed in the Commonwealth games and was unable to hold off the challenges of McKean and a superlative Coe. Although disappointed by his 800 m defeat Cram bounced back to beat Coe to the gold medal in the 1500 m. It turned out to be not only Cram's last major medal, but the end of the golden era for British middle distance running.", "His 1988 season saw him return to better form and he beat Bile in the Oslo Dream Mile in 1988 - his fourth consecutive victory in that race. Having run impressively in the Olympic trials over 800 m and winning in 1:44.16, (opening up an eight-metre gap over Tom McKean in a sprint down the home straight) he was touted as one of the favourites to win the gold medal over 1500 m at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 until a calf injury just before the games in a 1000 m race hampered his progress. The injury affected his performance at the games and he was eliminated in the heats of the 800 m. He recovered sufficiently to reach the final of the 1500 m, but could finish only fourth in a close race surprisingly won by Peter Rono."]}, {"page": "Sebastian Coe", "response": ["Coe had planned to have a somewhat quiet season in 1985, partly because of the intensity of the previous year's efforts to get himself ready in time for the Olympics, as well as a planned move up to 5000m, which never materialised. He suffered a recurrence of a back problem which had plagued him on and off since 1980; this caused him to miss several weeks of midseason training. He nevertheless managed to run some fast times towards the end of the season, but he lost his mile world record to Cram, who beat him in Oslo. In 1986, Coe won the 800m gold medal at the European Championships in Stuttgart, beating Tom McKean and Cram with a stunning last 200m of 24.8 and 100m of 12.4. It was his only 800m title at an international championship. He took the silver in the 1500m behind Cram, the mile world record holder proving too strong in the homestretch.  He then ran his personal best over 1500m with a 3:29.77 performance in Rieti, Italy, becoming the fourth man in history to break 3:30 at the distance. For the fourth year in his career (1979, 1981, 1982 & 1986), he was ranked No. 1 in the world at 800m, and he was in the top two for 1500m for the fifth time."]}, {"page": "Bellshill", "response": ["*Tom McKean, Olympic track athlete"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1988 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Tom McKean"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1992 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Tom McKean"]}, {"page": "1986 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Tom McKean||1:44.61"]}, {"page": "1990 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Tom McKean||1:44.76"]}, {"page": "List of male middle-distance runners", "response": ["* Tom McKean,  GBR"]}, {"page": "Peter Elliott (athlete)", "response": ["Elliott won a bronze medal in the 800m at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh behind Steve Cram and Tom McKean.

He also finished fourth in the Olympic 800m final. In January 1990, he became the Commonwealth champion over 1500m in Auckland. Later in the year, Elliott ran an outstanding 1:42.97 over 800m in Seville (ranking him No. 1 in the world for 1990, and making him the third fastest Briton of all time over the distance). This made him the favourite to win both middle distance gold medals at the 1990 European Championships in Split. However, due to injury problems he only entered for the 1500m and was tripped in the semi-final. After an appeal by the British team he was reinstated (against his own wishes and those of some other athletes), and went on to finish fourth in the final. A year later, Elliott had his revenge when he defeated the European champion Jens-Peter Herold in the 1500m race at the European Cup in Frankfurt.
