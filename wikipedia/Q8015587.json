A bowler who could bowl slow left-arm spin and left-arm medium pace, he enjoyed a \"prolific record\" before and after the Second World War in the South Wales Cricket Association which brought him his place in Glamorgan, and also played occasionally for the school-boy level Welsh national football team. He played fewer matches than his abilities - 56 wickets at 19.41 - warranted, due to his dedication to a family motoring business in Neath.He continued to play club cricket with Neath Cricket Club until well into his seventies", "link_mentions": {}}}
