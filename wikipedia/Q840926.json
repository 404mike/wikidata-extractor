Bolton replaced Cahill with another defender later in the month when they signed United States international Tim Ream from the New York Red Bulls. Ream had been on trial with both Bolton and West Bromwich Albion in late 2011 and signed on a three-and-a-half year deal, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be \u00a32.5 million.
