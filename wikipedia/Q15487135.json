The film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised its technical aspects and relatability, but had reservations regarding its originality. Neil Humphreys, in a Today feature of Singapore Dreaming, pointed out that it is untainted by crass sexual themes, unlike 12 Storeys, which featured similar characters. Humphreys wrote, \"the characters are immediately identifiable, particularly the women. And depicting such social reality on screen underscores Goh and Woo's bravery.\" Lin Wenqi, reviewing the film for a Taiwan Film Institute periodical, also found the film to be a captivating and relatable portrayal of Singapore society. According to Lin, unlike the excessively preachy Singaporean film I Not Stupid, Singapore Dreaming was impressive in its ability to weave life lessons into the plot and cinematography. Singaporean critic Vinita Ramani praised the acting, and agreed that many Singaporeans found the film relatable. However, Ramani wrote that the film \"falls short of expectations\" because it featured platitudes regarding the unsuccessful pursuit of material wealth by unfulfilled HDB heartlanders, a theme already \"milked to death\" in Singaporean films such as 12 Storeys (1997). The Spanish critic Jonathan Holland, writing for Variety, called the first half of the film \"over-stretched, noisy comedy\", preferring the portrayal of the funeral proceedings in the second half for its \"pleasing lightness of touch\" and lyrical music."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham", "response": ["* Neil Humphreys \u2013 author"]}, {"page": "Ning Cai (writer)", "response": ["In 2015, Cai organised a local book hunt called #SG50books50days, an initiative to generate an interest in reading, particularly local books.

Comparing his acting to Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, TODAY also ranked his role as one of the best \"male performances of the year in any genre, any country\", asking, \"Has there ever been a Singaporean performance that surpassed Lim's deranged taxi driver?\" Neil Humphreys called Lim's \"world-class performance\" in Perth \"almost without parallel\", writing, \"This is not a portrayal; it's a metamorphosis\".
