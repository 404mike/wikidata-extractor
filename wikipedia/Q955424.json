Following complaints and unfavourable reports to the South Australian government, notably by Dr. Goldsmith, Finniss was recalled in 1865, replaced by his second-in-command Manton.

The Royal Commission was told that they found the depot as Mr Brahe had left it, the plant untouched, and nothing removed of the useless things lying about, but a piece of leather. The party located Wills' remains where his body had been covered by King, some miles downstream of Camp LXV. They buried Wills on 18 September 1861, and inscribed a tree.

Three days later and approximately  away, Howitt found Burke's remains near Innamincka Waterhole,  north of Innamincka) in South Australia. Burke was buried wrapped in a Union Jack, under a box tree on the south-eastern bank of Cooper's Creek. Howitt blazed this tree at the head of Burke's grave. The Royal Geographical Society, organised to promote exploration, awarded Burke a posthumous RGS Founder's Medal in 1862. Wills was awarded nothing, as the Society's policy was to award only one medal to an exploration party. King received a gold watch, as did McKinlay, Landsborough and Walker for leading their various search parties.

At least one early attempt by Europeans to colonise the area was thwarted by drought, leading settlers to choose to leave. Indigenous people, though, have lived in the Channel Country for thousands of years. According to the Queensland Historical Atlas, it was \"Permanent waterholes and periodic pulses of substantial water\" in the form of, sometimes heavy, rain that \"allowed Aboriginal people to live in great numbers in the Channel Country\". Actual Indigenous population figures from the time before European colonisation are unavailable, but John McKinlay, who passed near Collingwood's future site in 1862 while leading the South Australian Burke Relief Expedition (see European exploration in the area below) remarked that Indigenous people \"seemed to pour out from every nook and corner where there was water\". One of these places would have been the Conn Waterhole, which does not dry up in times of drought, and it lies right near the Collingwood site, and also right near McKinlay's route.", "In less doubt is that John McKinlay's South Australian Burke Relief Expedition, a quest to find any sign of the vanished Burke and Wills expedition, came within a stone's throw of Collingwood's future site, if the explorers did not actually set foot there. McKinlay's Camp 32, where the expedition stayed overnight on 9 April 1862, was, as shown on a Royal Geographical Society map from 1863, right near the Conn Waterhole.
