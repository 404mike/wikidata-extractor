Under Johnston unprecedented success was to follow, with the Irish League championship trophy finding a home at Seaview in 1972\u201373, with the attacking duo of Tommy Finney and Jackie Fullerton scoring 47 goals between them. The club also set a record of going through the whole league campaign unbeaten at home, a feat which was repeated 40 years later in the 2012\u201313 season.
