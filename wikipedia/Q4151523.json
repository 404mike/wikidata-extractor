Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of \u00a3350,000, but without his goals the team struggled. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978.

The team's gold and green color scheme was based on that of the Green Bay Packers, which had been one of the more successful gridiron football teams of that time. The contrasting colors were also chosen with consideration towards viewers of black and white television, which was still fairly common in the United States at this time (as one team director said, they were \"good colors for television\").
