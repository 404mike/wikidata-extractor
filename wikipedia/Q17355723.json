The family lived at 37 Dublin Street, Carlow, and O'Meara likely attended St. Mary's Knockbeg College. From 1869 to 1871 O'Meara lived in Dublin, when he may have continued his education or received private art lessons. An early sketchbook that survives from this time shows landscape studies from around County Carlow, as well as studies of churches and animals. Two of O'Meara's siblings died young, and his mother died in 1873. It is following this, that he moved to Paris, where his cousin Kathleen O'Meara was a writer and correspondent for The Tablet."]}, {"page": "Kathleen (given name)", "response": ["* Kathleen O'Meara, Irish-French Catholic writer", "* Kathleen O'Meara, Irish politician"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Kathleen O'Meara (1839\u20131888), journalist, novelist, biographer"]}, {"page": "Kathleen O'Meara", "response": ["Kathleen O'Meara may refer to:", "* Kathleen O'Meara (writer) (1839\u20131888), Irish-French writer", "* Kathleen O'Meara (politician) (born 1960), Irish politician"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Kathleen O'Meara (1839\u20131888, Ireland), nv. & biographer"]}]}}
