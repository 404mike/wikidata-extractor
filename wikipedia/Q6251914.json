The Bahamas was a British Crown Colony at the time, and there were British Security personnel stationed in wartime in New York City and Washington, D.C. who could potentially have traveled easily and quickly to Nassau for an investigation. Bringing in the Miami Captains Melchen and Barker (Melchen had earlier guarded the Duke in Miami) proved an unfortunate decision.Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?, by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976; King of Fools, by John Parker (author), St. Martin's Press, 1988", "When Nancy was informed of her father's death and her husband's arrest, she was in Miami on her way for the summer to study dance with Martha Graham at Bennington, Vermont. It was her great friend Merce Cunningham who gave her the bad news. She then traveled to Bar Harbor, Maine, the family's summer home, to join her mother, at her husband's request. But Nancy soon returned to Nassau and began to organize her husband's defence. She was convinced that de Marigny was innocent and stood by him when many others, including her family, believed him guilty. The young countess soon became a favourite with the press worldwide for her auburn hair, deep-set eyes, fine figure and mild resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. The murder managed to knock the war off the front pages temporarily. Nancy spent heavily to hire a leading American private investigator, Raymond Schindler, to dig deeply into the case, and a prominent British-trained Bahamian lawyer, Godfrey W. Higgs, to defend her husband. They eventually found serious flaws in the prosecution's case.King of Fools, by John Parker (author), St. Martin's Press, 1988; Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes, by Marshall Houts, 1976.", "After the trial Nancy went with de Marigny to Cuba to stay with their old friend Ernest Hemingway. De Marigny was deported to Cuba after a recommendation by the murder trial's jury, because of his supposedly unsavoury character and frequent advances towards young girls in the Bahamas. De Marigny and Nancy separated in 1945, and divorced in 1949. He moved to Canada in 1945 and served for a time in the Canadian Army, but was later deported from Canada. He married his fourth wife, settled in Central America, and died in 1998. De Marigny was a tall,Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?, by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976 handsome man, a charming and bright conversationalist and an accomplished competitive sailor who won many regattas,King of Fools, by John Parker (author), 1988 and he later wrote two books.", "| The 1st edition (1972 book Kings X) and the second edition (1976 as Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?) was published in London by Robert Hale publishers. Houts was an American lawyer, and an FBI agent. In the first and second editions of his book, Houts proposed the theory that American gangster boss Meyer Lansky was behind the killing of Oakes, due to Oakes' resistance to casino gambling in the Bahamas. Lansky had apparently already obtained the approval of the Duke for his plans to develop gambling on the islands, after meeting with the Duke in Miami. Lansky was working with Christie, a property developer and Bahamian legislator, and other notable Bahamians, including Stafford Sands (who was the jury foreman at the de Marigny murder trial), to bring this about, with significant new construction of hotels to house tourists as part of the plan. Houts wrote that Oakes had earlier apparently given his approval for the casino project, but then changed his mind by the time of his murder, strongly opposing it. Houts wrote that Lansky sent several henchmen to meet Oakes on the night of the murder. The henchmen were to intimidate, try to persuade, and rough up Oakes if necessary, but not kill him, during a late-night meeting with Christie held aboard a fast powerboat that had traveled from Miami to Nassau earlier that day. But Oakes, age 68, died, and this was covered up. Oakes' body was taken back to his home by Christie (who was spotted as a passenger in his own station wagon by a Nassau Police Captain late that night, a fact which came out at the trial of de Marigny, and which directly contradicted Christie's statement that he had not left Oakes' home overnight), and a fake killing was then staged at Oakes' home, 'Westbourne'. Oakes had earlier, in 1940, allowed the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to stay at Westbourne while their official residence, Government House, was being renovated, and the Duke had slept in the bed where Oakes' body was found.Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes? by Marshall Houts, 1976.  It had troubled Bahamian legal authorities in the lead-up to the de Marigny trial that Oakes' body had apparently been moved, ascertained by examination of blood data, which showed blood flowing uphill, according to the case presented by prosecutors.King of Fools by John Parker (author), American edition, 1988, St. Martin's Press, , pp. 275-278; Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes? by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976. Houts also wrote that Lansky later privately punished his henchmen who had been involved with the murder, but did not specify the punishment.", "| John Parker", "| One theory put forward in the book, which was a biography of the Duke of Windsor, expanding on the work done by Houts a decade earlier, is that Oakes was murdered by associates of mob boss Meyer Lansky, after Oakes resisted Lansky's plans to develop casinos on the Bahama Islands. Lansky, together with other major organized crime figures, already had extensive casino interests in neighbouring Cuba. Early in his career, Parker had worked as a journalist in the Bahamas for several years, and dug into the Oakes case quite deeply. The two Miami police detectives were suspected of being on Lansky's payroll, and the Duke was warned off instigating a more professional investigation. Parker goes so far as to draw potential business connections between Lansky and the Duke, who had earlier met in Cuba. Parker wrote that the Duke had tried unsuccessfully to impose press censorship of the case from the start. The Duke directed the murder investigation from the beginning, but he and the Duchess of Windsor contrived to be visiting the United States during the de Marigny trial, so the Duke was not called as a witness.King of Fools, by John Parker, American edition, St Martin's Press, 1988. The Duke kept silent about the murder for the rest of his life.Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes, by Marshall Houts, Robert Hale, 1976.", "* King of Fools, by John Parker (author), (American edition), New York, St. Martin's Press, 1988."]}, {"page": "Jack Nicholson", "response": ["Nicholson's first big acting break came when a role opened up in Fonda and Hopper's Easy Rider (1969). He played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40\u00a0million. Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson's interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier \"anti-hero\" actors, such as James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, while promoting him into an \"overnight number-one hero of the counter-culture movement\".Parker, John. Michael Douglas: Acting on Instinct, Hachette Book Group (2011) e-book The part was a lucky break for Nicholson. The role had been written for the actor Rip Torn, who withdrew from the project after an argument with Hopper.Hill, Lee. A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern. Bloomsbury, 2001. In interviews, Nicholson later acknowledged the importance of being cast in Easy Rider: \"All I could see in the early films, before Easy Rider, was this desperate young actor trying to vault out of the screen and create a movie career.\" Nicholson was cast by Stanley Kubrick, who was impressed with his role in Easy Rider, in the part of Napoleon in a film about his life, and although production on the film commenced, the project fizzled out, partly due to a change in ownership at MGM, and other issues."]}, {"page": "Alfred de Marigny", "response": ["Marie Alfred Fouquereaux de Marigny, whose real name was Alfred Fouquereaux, \"de Marigny\" being his mother's name, was born on March 29, 1910, in Mauritius to a well-off French family.
