Meanwhile, Lady Kingsely-Browne's daughter Beebee throws herself at a famous author (DHL?) thus losing \"the richest commoner in England\" who marries Laura's sister. Laura renounces the Duke (in a way that inspired Still Life and Brief Encounter). Described by Rachel Ferguson as Delafield's most perfect novel.

Champneys wrote a dozen novels between the 1910s and the 1940s and two volumes of poetry. Her critically well-received 1925 novel Miss Tiverton Goes Out has been called \"a charming and poignant idyll\" and \"a kind of masterpiece of oddness,\" reminiscent of such divergent writers as John Galsworthy, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and Rachel Ferguson. It centers on a rather solitary girl named Julie, her dysfunctional family, and the old woman who lives next door, who becomes a focal point for the family's prejudices, fantasies, and anxieties even though she remains entirely absent throughout the book. Bride Elect (1913) and The Recoiling Force (1915) were also well reviewed."]}, {"page": "Theatre-fiction", "response": ["* Rachel Ferguson, A Child in the Theatre (1933)"]}]}}
