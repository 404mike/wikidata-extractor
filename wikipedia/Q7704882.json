He signed with Bristol Rovers as an amateur in February 1958 and turned professional with them in 1960. He made 132 League appearances and scored eleven goals with The Pirates, before joining Welsh club Wrexham and being appointed their captain in 1966. He was to last only a single year with The Robins though, as a knee injury forced him to retire from playing in 1967, aged 28.\nAfter his retirement from playing, he worked as the trainer of Bradford Park Avenue, a scout for Bristol Rovers, and a manager of his former non-League side Clifton St. Vincents. In addition, he also worked as an estate agent and auctioneer in Keynsham and ran the Red Lion pub in Odd Down. He also played cricket for Brislington Cricket Club, and golf for Saltford golf club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Terry Oldfield", "response": ["* Reflections \u2013 The Best of Terry Oldfield 1985\u20131995 \u2013 2000"]}, {"page": "Alvan Williams", "response": ["Brought in as a replacement for Jack Rowley, Williams took several of his Southend staff with him to the Racecourse Ground including first-team coach John Neal and players Steve Ingle, Ray Smith and Eddie May who was appointed as his Captain at the North Wales club. Williams was often known as a no nonsense manager and, already incensed following a tackle on Terry Oldfield that had resulted in a broken leg, once threw his team's runners-up medals from the 1967 Welsh Cup Final away after losing a two-legged final to Cardiff City. During his time with the club, he was instrumental in setting up youth facilities at the club that lead to several players progressing through the club's ranks during the 1970s. However, he was forced to resign as Wrexham manager after falling out with the club's board."]}, {"page": "Oldfield (name)", "response": ["*Terry Oldfield, British composer and brother of Mike Oldfield", "*Terry Oldfield (footballer), English footballer who played for Bristol Rovers and Wrexham"]}]}}
