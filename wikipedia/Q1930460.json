He was one of the greatest keyboard virtuosos of his time, and transcribed or arranged several Italian motets and madrigals by such composers as Lassus, Palestrina, and Giulio Caccini for his instruments. Some of his keyboard works are found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Philips also wrote many sacred choral works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1620s", "response": ["* Peter Philips of England (1560\u20131628), composer"]}, {"page": "William Byrd", "response": ["Byrd was an active and influential teacher.  As well as Morley, his pupils included Peter Philips,  Thomas Tomkins and probably Thomas Weelkes,  the first two of whom were important contributors to the Elizabethan and Jacobean virginalist school.  However, by the time Byrd died in 1623 the English musical landscape was undergoing profound changes.   The principal virginalist composers died off in the 1620s (except for  Giles Farnaby, who died in 1640, and Thomas Tomkins, who lived on until 1656) and found no real successors. Thomas Morley, Byrd's other major composing pupil, devoted himself to the cultivation of the madrigal, a form in which Byrd himself took little interest. The native tradition of Latin music which Byrd had done so much to keep alive more or less died with him, while consort music underwent a huge change of character at the hands of a brilliant new generation of professional musicians at the Jacobean and Caroline courts. The English Civil War, and the change of taste brought about by the Stuart Restoration, created a cultural hiatus which adversely affected the cultivation of Byrd's music together with that of Tudor composers in general."]}, {"page": "Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck", "response": ["Sweelinck's influence spread as far as Sweden and England, carried to the former by Andreas D\u00fcben and to the latter by English composers such as Peter Philips, who probably met Sweelinck in 1593. Sweelinck, and Dutch composers in general, had evident links to the English school of composition.  Sweelinck's music appears in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which otherwise only contains the work of English composers. He wrote variations on John Dowland's famous Lachrimae Pavane.  John Bull, who was probably a personal friend, wrote a set of variations on a theme by Sweelinck after the death of the Dutch composer."]}, {"page": "Girolamo Frescobaldi", "response": ["In his early twenties, Frescobaldi left his native Ferrara for Rome. Reports place Frescobaldi in that city as early as 1604, but his presence can only be confirmed by 1607. He was the church organist at Santa Maria in Trastevere, recorded as \u201cGirolamo Organista\u201d, from January to May of that year. He was also employed by Guido Bentivoglio, the Archbishop of Rhodes, and accompanied him on a trip to Flanders where Bentivoglio had been made nuncio to the court. It was Frescobaldi's only trip outside Italy. Although the court at Brussels was musically among the most important in Europe at the time, there is no evidence of Peeter Cornet's or Peter Philips' influence on Frescobaldi. Based on Frescobaldi's preface to his first publication, the 1608 volume of madrigals, the composer also visited Antwerp, where local musicians, impressed with his music, persuaded him to publish at least some of it. While abroad, Frescobaldi was elected on 21 July 1608 to succeed Ercole Pasquini as organist of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Frescobaldi remained in Flanders, however, through the summer and did not return to Rome until 29 October (delaying his arrival with an extended stay in Milan to publish another collection of music, the keyboard Fantasie). He took up his duties on 31 October and held the position, albeit intermittently, until his death. He also joined Enzo Bentivoglio's musical establishment after the latter settled in Rome in 1608, although he grew estranged from his patron after an affair with a young woman. A scandal involving competition between Bentivoglio and the Medici family eventually forced him to leave his position."]}, {"page": "Short octave", "response": ["While the short octave seems primarily to have been an economy measure, it does have the advantage that the player's left hand can in certain cases span a greater number of notes. The composer Peter Philips wrote a pavane in which the left hand plays many parallel tenths. This is a considerable stretch for many players, and become even harder when (as in Philips's pavane), there sometimes other notes included in the chord. Of this piece harpsichord scholar Edward Kottick writes, \"The sensuality of effortlessly achieving tenths is so strong, so delightful, that one cannot really claim to know the piece unless it has been played on a short-octave keyboard.\"Reference for Philips as well as quotation: Kottick (2003, 40). The full Pavane may be found starting on p. 321 of the Maitland/Squire edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, cited below.  Maitland and Squire likewise noticed (pp. xvii-xviii) that Philips's works require a short-octave instrument and indeed there two other pieces by Philips in this work (pp. 286, 327) of this type."]}, {"page": "Peter Phillips (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Peter Philips (c. 1560\u20131628), English composer", "* Peter Philips (politician) (1927\u20132009), Australian politician", "* Peter Philips (make-up artist) (fl. 1993\u20132014), Belgian make-up artist and creative director for Chanel"]}, {"page": "English Madrigal School", "response": ["* Peter Philips (c 1560\u20131628) (lived and published in the Netherlands, but wrote in an English style)"]}, {"page": "Fitzwilliam Virginal Book", "response": ["The manuscript includes music dating from approximately 1562 to 1612 by John Bull, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Giles Farnaby (51 of whose 52 known pieces are included), Thomas Tallis.  and Martin Peerson. Continental composers are also represented by the English composer in exile Peter Philips, whose music is largely arrangements of sacred music, madrigals and chansons. Other foreign composers are represented by, among others, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the elusive Jehan Oystermayre and Giovanni Picchi. There are 298 pieces which includes the eighth variation of 'Treg. Ground' (also Hugh Ashton's Ground in My Ladye Nevells Booke) as a separate piece. It is found under a flap on which has written no. 276, 'Pescodd Time' and it is assumed that Tregian either did not recognise the variation or thought it worthy of inclusion; as it happens, it is incomplete. As with many keyboard manuscripts of the time, the pieces were not written for a specific instrument, and most sound happily on all contemporary keyboard instruments, including virginals, harpsichord, clavichord and chamber organ.A few of the pieces presuppose an instrument arranged with a short octave in the bass, since they contain large intervals for the left hand that cannot be reached on the modern keyboard. The short octave was widely employed in all four instruments mentioned in the main text. Many of the pieces in the book are short, and many of them are character pieces with droll and memorable titles, including  \"Put Up Thy Dagger, Jemy\", \"The New Sa-Hoo\", and \"Quodlings Delight\" by Giles Farnaby; \"Nobody's Gigge\", by Richard Farnaby; \"Pakington's Pownde\" and \"The Irishe Dumpe\" (anonymous); \"The Ghost\" and \"The Earle of Oxford's Marche\" by William Byrd; \"Worster Braules\" by Thomas Tomkins; and the famous \"Lachrymae Pavan\" by John Dowland, as arranged by Giles Farnaby and by William Byrd.", "===Peter Philips==="]}, {"page": "Emilio de' Cavalieri", "response": ["In 1587, Ferdinando de' Medici succeeded his brother as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and in 1588 he brought Cavalieri to Florence as an overseer of artists, craftsmen and musicians. Cavalieri was master of ceremonies for the extremely opulent intermedi that the Medici family required for events such as weddings. Count Giovanni de' Bardi, the founder and patron of the Florentine Camerata, also collaborated on these productions. In May 1589, the festivities for the marriage of Grand Duke Ferdinando to Christina of Lorraine included a performance of Girolamo Bargagli's La pellegrina, with six especially elaborate intermedi. The 1st number of the final intermedio (6) was initially a piece by Bardi but was replaced in the actual intermedio by Cavalieri's virtuosic number based on the Aria del Gran Duca which became popular all over Europe and occurs in many arrangements and variations such as that made by Peter Philips in Antwerp. Cavalieri may have gotten some of his ideas for monody directly from Bardi, since Cavalieri was not a member of the Camerata during its period of activity a few years earlier. He may have developed his rivalry with Giulio Caccini, another extremely important and influential early monodist during this period."]}, {"page": "Thomas Morley", "response": ["Morley was born in Norwich, the son of a brewer. Most likely he was a singer in the local cathedral from his boyhood, and he became master of choristers there in 1583.  However, it is assumed that Morley moved from Norwich Cathedral sometime before 1574 to be a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was working as a singer in London in the 1570s and appears to have studied with William Byrd at that time who was his mentor, who also taught contemporary Peter Philips. While the dates he studied with Byrd are not known, they were most likely in the early 1570s.Foster, Michael W.. \"Morley, Thomas (b. 1556/7, d. in or after 1602).\" Michael W.

In his 1597 publication A Plain and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke, Morley mentions Byrd as his mentor. In 1588 he received his bachelor's degree from the University of Oxford, and shortly thereafter was employed as organist at St. Paul's in London.  His young son died the following year in 1589. He and his wife Susan had three children between 1596 and 1600. He may have been a Roman Catholic, like Byrd. He was able to avoid prosecution as a recusant, and there is evidence that he may have been an informer on the activities of Roman Catholics."]}, {"page": "Philips (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Peter Philips (1560\u20131628), English composer, organist, and Catholic priest exiled to Flanders"]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Peter Philips (c. 1560\u20131628)"]}, {"page": "Water organ", "response": ["Among Renaissance writers on the water organ, Salomon de Caus is particularly informative.

The earlier music, for example, in his collection published in 1609 in Hamburg, is based on English models, and similar to the contemporary work of composers such as Peter Philips and John Dowland. Later he began to work with Italian models, writing the first known canzona by an Englishman; in addition he began to arrange his dances into suites, a practice which would become common during the Baroque era. Some of the dances he wrote were in forms previously unknown in Germany such as the branle, maschera, and volta."]}, {"page": "Giles Farnaby", "response": ["Farnaby is considered one of the great English virginalists, together with William Byrd, John Bull, Orlando Gibbons, Peter Philips and Thomas Tomkins among others.
