At the age of 9, his aunt, who was his guardian, died. He then left school and took up work as an errand boy. In 1869 he went to sea and travelled to all parts of the world in various capacities including that of second mate of the Harbinger and chief mate of the Day Dawn, under Capt. John R. H. Ward jun in 1879 when she was dismasted and disabled. \nHaving spent 15 years of his life at sea, since the tender age of 12, he would later describe the hardships of his early life thus:\nI have been beaten by a negro lad as big again as myself, and only a Frenchman interfered on my behalf. Those were the days when boys in Geordie colliers or East Coast fishing smacks were often beaten to insanity and jumped overboard, or were done to death in truly savage fashion, and all that was necessary to account for their non returning was a line in the log to the effect that they had been washed or had fallen overboard.\nA parallel may be drawn with Joseph Conrad's career at sea aboard Torrens 1891\u20131893.\nHe was a clerk in the Meteorological Office from 1883 to 1889. His reputation was made over the publication of The Cruise of the \"Cachalot\" (1898); and he also wrote, amongst other books, Idylls of the Sea (1899); Sea Wrack (1903); The Call of the Deep (1907) and A Compleat Sea Cook (1912), besides many articles and essays. He lectured extensively and was highly critical of Australasia's lack of defences against what he saw as imminent naval threats from Germany and Japan. He died at Madeira on 1 March 1915.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sea shanty", "response": ["The 1914 collection by Frank Thomas Bullen, Songs of Sea Labour,Bullen, Frank. T. and W.F. Arnold, Songs of Sea Labour, Orpheus Music Publishing (1914). differed from the work of writers such as Masefield in having a more practical, rather than romantic, tone. Bullen, an Englishman, was an experienced shantyman, who sailed during the heyday of shanties to ports in the Southern U.S. and the Caribbean.Bullen and Arnold, Songs of Sea Labour, p. vi. He took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection, thus resisting the temptation to let shanties slide into the genres of ballads or other off-duty songs. (Pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs, clearly demarcated, at the end of the book.Bullen and Arnold, Songs of Sea Labour, p. vii.) And rather than shape the shanties to appear as narrative pieces, he noted that, since most shanties would usually be improvised, it would be disingenuous to present more than one or two sample verses. As for his framing of the genre's origins, Bullen stated his belief that, \"[T]he great majority of these tunes undoubtably emanated from the negroes of the Antilles and the Southern states, a most tuneful race if ever there was one, men moreover who seemed unable to pick up a ropeyarn without a song\u00a0...\"Bullen and Arnold, Songs of Sea Labour, p. xii. And Bullen's musicologist editor, Arnold, claimed, \"[T]he majority of the Chanties are Negroid in origin\u00a0...\"Bullen and Arnold, Songs of Sea Labour, p. viii. Bullen's insistence on including only true work songs in the collection meant that he likely omitted songs\u2014generally those for heaving tasks, like capstan work\u2014which had been easily borrowed from the land-based traditions of various nations. The effect of including only the most exclusively work-oriented songs meant that a higher percentage of African-American songs were represented.

Adults appear to be specialized hagfish-like scavengers, using their powerfully muscled jaws and short, stout teeth to tear away chunks of flesh from carcasses that have fallen to the sea floor. However, this eel is more notorious for its parasitic habits, which are often repeated in literature. Frank Thomas Bullen, in the 1904 Denizens of the Deep, wrote that the eel \"attaches himself to the bodies of the larger, fleshier fish, such as halibut, and by sheer force of suction and boring withal works his ravenous way right into their bodies, at what misery to his involuntary hosts can only be imagined.\" Spencer Fullerton Baird reported that the eels are \"not unfrequently found nestling along the backbone of the halibut and cod, where they seem to have the power of abiding for some time without actually causing death.\" Baird also made note of the eels' supposed habit of burrowing into the abdominal cavities of netted, gravid shad and eating their eggs within the span of \"a few minutes\"."]}, {"page": "Frank Bullen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Thomas Bullen"]}, {"page": "Frank T.
