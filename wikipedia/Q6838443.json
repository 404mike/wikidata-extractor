MacLeod has also worked with Argent. Other bands MacLeod formed of note include Soft Cloud, Loud Earth with Mick Softley and the acoustic-based band Amber.", "In the early days in The Cock and later The Peahen pubs, MacLeod was a regular and one of the few finger pickers around. He often played with other musicians of note: the flat picking Mick Softley and school friend Maddy Prior. In the summer time MacLeod travelled to the South West where he made friends with John Renbourn. The two busked together from around 1961 to 1964.", "In 1964 MacLeod and Renbourn recorded three or four demos together; 'South Coast', 'Cocaine', 'It Hurts Me Too' and 'Train Blues'.  Donovan was influenced from 1961 onwards by MacLeod's finger picking and the flat pick styles made popular by Ramblin' Jack Elliott which had been a big inspiration on Mick Softley and 'Dirty Hugh'. MacLeod taught Donovan claw hammer style and finger pick techniques (see Hurdy Gurdy) and many songs from his folk blues heroes. Donovan said in an interview for Beat Instrumental in May 1965 titled 'Donovan's Big Influence? It's Not Dylan!'", "MacLeod returned to St Albans and formed Soft Cloud-Loud Earth with Mick Softley, 'Candy' John Carr (who also went to Skye for Donovan's U.S. tour line-up) and Mike Thomson. Due to the erratic behaviour of Softley, Carr and Thomson jumped ship and soon formed Open Road with Donovan, leaving MacLeod to continue with Softley in the duo Soft Cloud. After Soft Cloud had evaporated MacLeod formed a new band, the sitar-drenched Amber with Julian McAllister and Ray Cooper.  Amber had some tracks produced by former The Yardbirds singer Keith Relf."]}, {"page": "Sunrise (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Sunrise, by Mick Softley, 1970"]}, {"page": "The Real Donovan", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:40"]}, {"page": "A Touch of Music a Touch of Donovan", "response": ["#\"The War Drags on\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "Catch the Wind (1971 album)", "response": ["#\"Gold Watch Blues\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "Donovan File", "response": ["#\"Gold Watch Blues\" (Mick Softley)", "#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "Catch the Wind (1986 album)", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "Colours (1972 Donovan album)", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley)"]}, {"page": "The Early Years (Donovan album)", "response": ["#\"Gold Watch Blues\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 2:32"]}, {"page": "Sunshine Superman: 18 Songs of Love and Freedom", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:42"]}, {"page": "Universal Soldier (1967 Donovan album)", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:44"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Music of Donovan", "response": ["#\"The War Drags on\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:42"]}, {"page": "Mellow (Donovan album)", "response": ["#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:43"]}, {"page": "Summer Day Reflection Songs", "response": ["#\"Goldwatch Blues\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 2:34", "#\"The War Drags On\" (Mick Softley) \u2013 3:44"]}, {"page": "List of songs about the Vietnam War", "response": ["*\"The War Drags On\" written and recorded by Mick Softley; also recorded by Donovan"]}, {"page": "Richard Thompson discography", "response": ["|1971||Street Singer||Mick Softley"]}, {"page": "List of Peel sessions", "response": ["* Mick Softley: (2 sessions, 1972\u201373)"]}, {"page": "Tony Cox (record producer)", "response": ["He entered the music business as a performer in 1966, and as a duo with Douglas MacRae-Brown released The Young Idea LP in 1967,The Young Idea LP, at Discogs.com Retrieved 5 November 2016. and had a UK top ten hit single with a cover version of the Lennon-McCartney song \"With a Little Help from My Friends\".The Young Idea, on officialcharts.com] Retrieved 5 November 2016.
