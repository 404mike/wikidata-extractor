He co-founded the left-wing media organisation Novara Media in 2011, and has hosted and co-hosted many of its podcasts and videos. After a 2014 video for the publication, he popularised the term \"fully automated luxury communism\", which describes a post-capitalist society in which automation greatly reduces the amount of labour humans need to do. He wrote a book in 2019, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, about the subject.

One incident in 2018 which received particular attention was when Novara Media contributor Ash Sarkar said during a discussion on Good Morning Britain of protests against US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK that she had also criticised Barack Obama and the Democratic Party because she was 'literally a communist'. The copy of this clip on Novara's Youtube channel achieved more than 6 million views and members of Novara media's leadership team were invited on Newsnight to discuss the incident. It was also reported during 2018 that Novara staff regularly took briefings from the Labour Party via Whatsapp. During the 2019 election, Novara campaigned enthusiastically for the party, with co-founder Aaron Bastani suggesting on social media that the party's vote share would exceed 36% on the eve of the ballot, however the actual figure was 32.1%.", "During the 2019 election, Novara campaigned enthusiastically for the party, with co-founder Aaron Bastani estimating that the party's vote share would exceed 36% on the eve of the ballot, however the actual figure was 32.1%.
