She is known for her work in performance art which has been exhibited since the early 1990s at venues including Tate Modern, the Ikon Gallery, the Centre d\u2019Art Contemporain Gen\u00e8ve and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. She teaches at Chelsea College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, UCL. In 2004\u20132005 she was the Helen Chadwick Fellow at the British School in Rome.Newman's work around economic, social and ecological crises led to the creation of a band, The Gluts (Hayley Newman, Gina Birch and Kaffe Matthews) and their eco-electro musical Caf\u00e9 Carbon, which they took to the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009. She wrote the novella Common, based on her experiences as 'Self-appointed Artist in Residence' in the City of London, about the economic crisis from within, as it was happening on the streets of the square mile. The book documents the crash in the global markets, turbulence in the Eurozone and the riots that started in London but spread to the rest of Britain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shu Yang", "response": ["After a split with Chen Jin, Shu Yang organised the first Dadao Live Arts Festival in 2003, the largest performance art festival in Asia featuring works by Wang Chuyu, Liang Tao.
