Jansch reported that she struggled in her youth academically, but had a passion for drawing and writing. She attended Walthamstow Technical College for her Foundation year and from there gained a place at Goldsmith's. This proved a great disappointment, as figurative art was greatly derided there at the time. She left after the first year.\nWhile at Walthamstow, in 1967, she had met the musician Roy Harper. It was Harper who introduced her to the already renowned guitarist Bert Jansch, whom she later married. They had a son, Kieron, now a film-maker, in 1971. They separated in 1974 and divorced some years later.\nShe bought a small hill farm in Dyfed, breeding Welsh cobs and specialized in painting traditional equestrian portraits until starting to sculpt in the 80s. Discovering driftwood as a medium for sculpture proved revelatory. Heather spent many years perfecting the translation of her complex work into bronze, pioneering a technique that made them indistinguishable from the driftwood original\nBy 1986 she was exhibiting sculpture regularly with Courcoux and Courcoux, a leading provincial contemporary gallery then based in Salisbury that took her work to the London Contemporary Art Fair where it received very favourable reviews.\nHer life-size driftwood horses became her hallmark and in 1999 were featured in the Shape of the Century 100 Years of Sculpture in Britain at Salisbury Cathedral.The exhibition was then taken to London's Canary Wharf as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000 where her horses caught the attention of Tim Smit KBE founder of the Eden Project; she was invited to become one of their resident artists. Her horse was voted the most popular art work there and has since become widely known as The Eden Horse.There are pieces by Heather in private collections around the world including in the US, Canada, Switzerland, France and Romania. Heather exhibited internationally on a number of occasions, including, in 2007, as artist in residence at Arte Sella in Borgo Valsugana, Italy.\n\nA life-long writer, in 2009 she set up Olchard Press. She published \"Heather Jansch's Diary\", \"Living with the Legend\" about her life with Bert, and ruminations on her expeditions to Italy, \"The Italian Job\", released in Summer 2021.\n\nShe died, following a stroke, on 5th July 2021 at Olchard, Devon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bert Jansch", "response": ["On 19 October 1968, Jansch married Heather Sewell.Harper, C., p. 222 At the time, she was an art student and had been the girlfriend of Roy Harper.Harper, C., pp. 221\u201322 She inspired several of Jansch's songs and instrumentals, the most obvious being \"Miss Heather Rosemary Sewell\" from his 1968 album Birthday Blues, but Jansch says that, despite the name, \"M'Lady Nancy\" from the 1971 Rosemary Lane album was also written for her.Kennedy, p. 26 As Heather Jansch, she has become a well-known sculptor."]}, {"page": "Rosemary Lane (album)", "response": ["Rosemary Lane is the seventh album by contemporary British folk musician Bert Jansch, released in 1971.
