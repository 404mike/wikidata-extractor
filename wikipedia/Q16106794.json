Likewise, the socialist historian Chris Searle argues that, whether the rebels meant to lay particular emphasis on French revolutionary ideology, the important thing is that the British clearly thought so, blaming Jacobinism for the rebellion. Dr Hay, in his memoirs, repeatedly refers to the outbreak as a revolution rather than a rebellion, for example, and Jacobs argues that the rebels' slogan\u2014Libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9 ou la mort\u2014was not only a battle cry: their \"revolutionary aspirations, ideology, battle colours, and their mountain redoubt [became] one and the same\". Tessa Murphy, on the other hand, has placed the rebellion as less a direct consequence of the French revolution, and the result of international rivalries in the Caribbean. This rivalry meant that men like F\u00e9don and Philip, for example, \"experienced an expansion\u2014and later a violent contraction\u2014of their possibilities for political inclusion\" which drove them to rebellion. The difference, she says, is that while the revolutions that raged throughout the Caribbean at this point were concerned with gaining new droits de l'homme for all, in Grenada it was the recovery of traditional rights that inspired revolt. Men such as they, she says, \"had lived in Grenada for generations, and...had long shaped the island's political economy\", and wanted to regain that position."]}, {"page": "Gus John", "response": ["* 2010 \u2013 The Case for a Learner\u2019s Charter for Schools (with an introduction by Chris Searle).
