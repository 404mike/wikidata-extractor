Instead of shying away from these influences Wright makes an active effort to show his referencing, adding a 'Homage-O-Meter' to all of his releases, a device that displays each directorial nod he has made during shooting. In 2002, he made appearances as a scientist and a technician named Eddie Yorque during both series of Look Around You, a BBC-program created by a member of the Spaced cast, Peter Serafinowicz.

So impressed was Bart, that he came out of obscurity and travelled to Australia for Jarrett's triumphant production in 1985.
