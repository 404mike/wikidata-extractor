He lives and works in Venice, California.A self-taught photographer, Brighton-born Luchford left school at 15 and moved to London, where he worked at a hair salon. He was one of the youngest photographers to work for The Face Magazine aged just 20. \nLuchford first signed with New York based agency Art + Commerce at the age of 24. He was one of the first photographers to collaborate with model Kate Moss. In 1997, he signed exclusively to Prada, and has since shot advertising campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Chlo\u00e9, Lanvin, Calvin Klein, and Gucci. He has collaborated extensively with British artist Jenny Saville with shows at the Gagosian Gallery. Luchford's work has also been showed and featured in the permanent collection of MoMA, Victoria and Albert Museum, The Getty Museum, and the Hermitage Museum.\nHis editorial work has been featured in magazines such as The Face, Arena, i-D,  and British, French, American, Italian Vogue magazines, Harper's Bazaar, and Self Service Magazine.\nLuchford's style is influenced by his love of cinema. His signature look is to work with cinematic lighting, both on location and in studio. Luchford was the first to bring this aesthetic into fashion photography. \nIn 2001, Luchford directed the film Here to Where, about a filmmaker wanting to make a film about a man stranded at an airport. Nominated for the Michael Powell award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the film is considered to be an inspiration for Steven Spielberg's The Terminal.In 2009 Luchford completed his first solo monograph with Steidl/Dangin. In the same year, Luchford joined one of the leading artist management agencies Art Partner.Luchford has published six books, Jenny Saville & Glen Luchford: Closed Contact, Gagosian Gallery (2002), Glen Luchford (2009), Damaged Negatives (2013), Glen Luchford: Pictorialism (2014), which chronicles thirty-three years of his career and features both his earliest photographs and his most well-known ones. His latest book, The Agony and the Ecstasy, was published in 2018.Most recently, Luchford collaborated with Alessandro Michele  on the re-branding of Gucci after Michele's appointment as the brand's Creative Director in 2015.\nHe photographed the designer\u2019s first campaigns, and created a brand new image of Gucci with Michele. His cinematic approach on the images took Gucci away from the sexualised campaigns of Michele\u2019s predecessor Frida Giannini and the Tom Ford era. He photographed Gucci's campaigns until Spring Summer 2020.Outside of his photography and film work, Luchford has launched multiple businesses;\nin 2014 he bought and renovated The Rose Hotel in Venice, California, which he then sold in September 2019.\nAdditionally, he owns a post production company called Venice Post.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mehran Karimi Nasseri", "response": ["Glen Luchford and Paul Berczeller made the Here to Where mockumentary (2001), also featuring Nasseri.

The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford initially as an experiment, but the group thought it worked as a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of \"how holding on to your own innocence is a lot harder than holding on to someone else's\". Bono said, \"With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back.\" According to Bono, the tattoo on Mullen's upper arm is based on Native American mythology of the Pawnee tribe and is a symbol of protecting innocence. The cover parallels those of the band's earlier albums, Boy (1980) and War (1983), which featured the face of a young boy, Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi."]}, {"page": "List of Harper's Bazaar Russia cover models", "response": ["| October || Freja Beha Erichsen || Glen Luchford"]}, {"page": "Jasmine Sanders", "response": ["Sanders has appeared in editorials for American Vogue, Vogue Italia, British Vogue, Vogue Russia, Vogue Arabia, LOVE, Allure, CR Fashion Book, Esquire, Glamour, GQ, Interview and W.
