During World War II he was parachuted into France as part of Operation Jedburgh to work with the French resistance and later served with the Norwegian resistance. He worked in the Foreign Office from 1947 to 1957 and was a solicitor and shipping advisor.\nMarten was Member of Parliament for Banbury from 1959 to 1983 and served as a junior aviation minister 1962\u201364 and Overseas Development minister under Margaret Thatcher. Marten was a leading opponent of the European Economic Community. At the end of his time in Parliament, he was knighted on 6 January 1983. He died in Dorset aged 69.\nHe was a director of the private shipping and aircraft company Davies and Newman and was in office when it was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1971 and had been associated with the company since 1962.A keen raconteur, Marten told a story of a tour he took around the Palace of Westminster with his Banbury constituents. Touring through the maze of corridors they turned a corner and met Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, wearing the full regalia of his office. Recognising his Parliamentary colleague in the midst of the Banbury constituents, Hailsham boomed, \"Neil\". Not needing to be told again, the tour party fell to its knees with some haste.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Secretary of State for International Development", "response": ["| Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "Tony Baldry", "response": ["Following the retirement of veteran Banbury Conservative MP Neil Marten, Baldry successfully contested the seat at the 1983 general election and was elected to Parliament with a majority of 13,025."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum", "response": ["Throughout this period, the Labour Party was divided, both on the substantive issue of EC accession and on the question of whether accession ought to be approved by referendum. In 1971 pro-Market figures such as Roy Jenkins, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, said a Labour government would have agreed to the terms of accession secured by the Conservatives. However, the National Executive Committee and the Labour Party Conference disapproved of the terms. In April 1972, the anti-EC Conservative MP Neil Marten tabled an amendment to the European Communities Bill, which called for a consultative referendum on entry. Labour had previously opposed a referendum, but the Shadow Cabinet decided to support Marten's amendment. Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader in opposition to the decision, and many Labour MPs abstained in the division."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Neil Marten (1916\u20131985)"]}, {"page": "Andrzej Panufnik", "response": ["In 1959, Panufnik became romantically involved with Winsome Ward, who was diagnosed with cancer the following year. During this time, Panufnik, who had been composing his \"Autumn Music\" with poetic intentions, changed it into a work with tragic connotations.  He still had to complete his Piano Concerto for Birmingham and to fulfil his commission for his Sinfonia Sacra. In 1960 he met author and photographer Camilla Jessel, then aged twenty-two, who had worked as a personal assistant in the United States, and whose brother, Toby Jessel, was in politics.  The British MP Neil Marten (who had been the person at the British Foreign Office responsible for looking after Panufnik's defection) suggested that Camilla Jessel could help him with his correspondence. Panufnik accepted, and she rapidly discovered that he had not replied to letters offering conducting engagements and enquiring about commissions. Accepting these engagements and commissions gave Panufnik the resources to allow him to devote more time to composition. In 1963, Panufnik entered his newly completed Sinfonia Sacra for a prestigious international competition in Monaco for the best orchestral work: it won first prize."]}, {"page": "Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1959 || Neil Marten || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "Conservative government, 1957\u20131964", "response": ["|Neil Marten||3 December 1962||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Ministry of Aviation", "response": ["* 3 December 1962: Neil Marten"]}, {"page": "List of Old Rossallians", "response": ["* Neil Marten \u2013 Conservative MP for Banbury 1959\u20131983 and Minister for Overseas Development 1979\u20131983"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Neil Marten; MP for Banbury (1959\u20131983)"]}, {"page": "Knife Edge Two Piece 1962\u201365", "response": ["Moore liked the site so much that he did not even visit an alternative site in Hyde Park; he felt that the sculpture might have been lost in such a big park, recalling an experience he had trying to find the sculpture Riva by Jacob Epstein in the park.
