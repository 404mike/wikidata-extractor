A year later, however, he passed his late-entry exams, and transferred to Hemsworth Grammar School. His cricket prowess was such that he captained the school's cricket First XI at the age of 15.

Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\".

The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims.

He set the county records for stumpings in a season, in 1949, and for catches in a season, in 1963, as well as for the most dismissals in a season. He also set the county record for the number of career dismissals, was the first to make six dismissals in an innings, and equalled the county record of nine dismissals in a match."]}, {"page": "William Dean (Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Dean was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Along with fellow Yorkshireman Malcolm Walker, he was picked by Somerset for the match against the touring Indian side at the County Ground, Taunton from 28 May 1952. Somerset batted first and reached 193 for eight wickets when Dean batted at No 10, joining all-rounder Johnny Lawrence, who had recommended him to the county. The pair put on 133 for the ninth wicket, only 13 short of the county side's then ninth wicket record, and Lawrence made an unbeaten 103, his first century after six years of county cricket. Dean made 21 before being bowled by Vijay Hazare.", "According to the book, Dean had a complicated sporting and personal life. He played good standard league cricket and, like Walker, impressed Johnny Lawrence at Lawrence's cricket school at Rothwell enough to suggest the trial for Somerset; having failed that, he became a professional at Stockport Cricket Club and other northern clubs, but his long-term career was in accountancy and in a range of businesses including betting shops and a fishing bait enterprise. His private life became more tangled when, married with a daughter, he eloped with the sixteen-year-old daughter of a farmer, and then further complicated when, because of a dodgy business deal, he felt obliged to change his name to \"Bill Barrett\" by deed poll; under this new name, he opened a Yorkshire jazz club, performing himself on the saxophone. He died in a hospice in York at the age of 68 from cancer of the oesophagus and sternum brought on, his family believed, by a blow to the chest from a cricket ball in his youth."]}, {"page": "Stuart Rogers", "response": ["Rogers' second season as Somerset captain, 1951, was more difficult than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, but no one else apart from a couple of irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats."]}, {"page": "Thomas Wells (cricketer)", "response": ["Wells' single appearance for Worcestershire was in August 1950, when the county played Somerset at New Road. He had a poor match, scoring 0 and 9, and though he did take two catches they were both to dismiss tail-enders. Worcestershire collapsed in their first innings against the leg-spin of Johnny Lawrence, who took career-best figures of 8-41, and Somerset won the match by four wickets."]}, {"page": "Miles Coope", "response": ["A right-handed middle-order batsman sometimes used as an opener and an occasional leg-break bowler, Coope played for Yorkshire's second eleven in Minor Counties cricket before the war.

In the next match, he performed even better: he took 45 minutes to score his first run but then made 35 and shared a 118-run sixth-wicket partnership with his captain, Maurice Tremlett, before finishing off a victory for Somerset with three of the last four Nottinghamshire wickets. Those bowling figures of three for 44 were to remain his best, however. "]}, {"page": "David Evans (Somerset cricketer, born 1928)", "response": ["Evans was born at Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol.  A club cricketer in Weston-super-Mare, he played first for Somerset's first team as a right-handed middle-order batsman in June 1953 in a three-day non-first-class match against a Royal Air Force team that included Fred Trueman, top-scoring with 34 in the county's first innings and making 56 in the second innings, when Harold Gimblett got a century. He then made his first-class debut in a crushing two-day defeat by Glamorgan in which he failed to reach double figures in either innings. He was one of several batsmen who filled various batting positions across the middle of the summer in a very poor side, which finished bottom of the County Championship for the second year in succession. Only in his final innings, 42 against Essex at Weston-super-Mare, did he make much impact: his stand of 86 for the sixth wicket with Johnny Lawrence was deemed \"spirited\" by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, though Somerset were following on at the time and lost the match rather easily. His medium-pace bowling failed to take a wicket in eight overs in his first-class matches."]}, {"page": "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Somerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1951, he played in all but the first of Somerset's County Championship matches \u2013 he appeared in 27 games \u2013 and was awarded his county cap. He took 50 wickets in all at the relatively high average of 33.76. After the third Championship match, Maurice Tremlett, who had taken eight wickets to that point, did not bowl again during the season, and Redman opened the bowling in every other game with Bertie Buse, also barely above medium pace; they were backed by the three spin bowlers, Ellis Robinson, Johnny Lawrence and Horace Hazell, and these five bowlers then took all of Somerset's wickets for Championship matches across the whole summer. Redman had limited numbers of successful days: against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil he took five wickets for 151 runs after Tremlett had withdrawn from the attack. But his best performance was a month later at Frome: in the Derbyshire first innings, bowling unchanged with Buse, Redman took seven wickets for 23 runs as Derbyshire were dismissed for just 52 in an hour and 45 minutes. This return, from what Wisden termed \"deadly swing bowling by Redman\", was the best of his first-class career. In addition to his bowling, Redman also batted usefully in the lower order in 1951, making 472 runs at an average of 13.88. His highest score of the season, and the highest of his career, was 45 against Essex at Brentwood."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Johnny Lawrence", "|align=left|Johnny Lawrence", "|align=left|Johnny Lawrence", "|align=left|Johnny Lawrence"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 259 || Johnny Lawrence"]}, {"page": "Len Parslow", "response": ["Parslow made his only first-class appearance for Essex against Somerset in the 1946 County Championship.
