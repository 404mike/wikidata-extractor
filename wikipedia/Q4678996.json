He scored his first career goal and Swindon's first of the 2011\u201312 season during the opening game of the season against Crewe. The goal was a penalty following a foul on Billy Bodin by Adam Dugdale. The game ended in a 3\u20130 win for Swindon. Kennedy went on to start the first thirteen matches of the new campaign. With Swindon making an indifferent start, di Canio brought Liam Ridehalgh in on loan from Huddersfield Town on 28 September 2011. As a result, Kennedy was dropped from the first team, only appearing in the 4\u20131 FA Cup win over Huddersfield in which Ridehalgh was not allowed to play. It wasn't until the turn of the year when Kennedy again made the starting eleven, appearing in four consecutive victories, including a famous win over Premier League side Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup. After appearing in a big 4\u20131 win at promotion chasing Southend and then helping Swindon to the 2012 Football League Trophy Final the following week, Kennedy made just two more starts over the next two months as during the buildup to the Wembley final, di Canio signed Jay McEveley on loan from Barnsley and thrust him straight into the starting eleven. Kennedy was to make just one more appearance for Swindon, in a 2\u20131 defeat at Aldershot Town in a game where a point would have sealed promotion. Even though Swindon won the League Two title, Kennedy was released on 18 May 2012 after his contract was not going to be renewed and he left with four other Swindon players."]}, {"page": "Crewe Alexandra F.C.
