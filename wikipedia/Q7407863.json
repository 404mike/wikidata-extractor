The Gators spent most of the first half-century of SEC play in the bottom half of the standings.  They only finished higher than fourth twice between 1932\u201333 and 1979\u201380.  From the founding of the SEC until 1960, the head coach's slot was filled part-time by a coach from another Gator team, including baseball coaches Brady Cowell, Ben Clemons and Sam McAllister, head football coach Josh Cody, and football assistants Spurgeon Cherry and John Mauer. This was common practice at most SEC schools apart from Kentucky well into the 1940s and 1950s.    Cody had previously coached the Clemson and Vanderbilt basketball teams; Mauer had previously coached the Kentucky and Tennessee basketball squads.  None of them were able to build the Gators into consistent contenders in conference play."]}, {"page": "1908\u201309 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Sam McAllister"]}]}}
