One such pupil, Spike Thompson (Dexter Fletcher), is forced to work on the paper rather than be expelled from school.

She quits the paper at the end of \"Monday-Tuesday\", and in \"Day Dreams\" laments \"Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?\" Intimidated by socialising, she hiccups at the idea. She is so nervous at a cocktail party, in \"At Last a Dragon\", that she attempts to leave on several occasions.
