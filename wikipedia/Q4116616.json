He also had playing spells at Queens Park Rangers, Osasuna, Southampton, and Bolton Wanderers.\nAfter retiring as a player, Lee joined the coaching staff at Liverpool before joining Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's England set-up in 2001. He became assistant manager to Sam Allardyce at Bolton Wanderers in 2005, and their manager in 2007. He was then appointed assistant manager to Rafael Ben\u00edtez at Liverpool in 2008 before returning to Bolton Wanderers in 2012 as head of academy coaching and development. Lee was appointed assistant coach at Southampton under Ronald Koeman in 2014 before joining Sam Allardyce's England staff two years later. Lee followed Allardyce to Crystal Palace and Everton in 2017.

Despite this, poor results in the Champions League and a disagreement over future transfers lead to a public falling-out with the club's owners, which played out in the media at the end of November. It was suggested that Ben\u00edtez's position was now under serious threat. The resulting coverage resulted in a show of support by fans in support of Ben\u00edtez which culminated in a fans' march in support of Ben\u00edtez ahead of the critical Champions League home tie with Porto, which they won 4\u20131. It later emerged that J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann had been offered Ben\u00edtez's job before eventually accepting the post of Bayern Munich manager. Such a revelation damaged Ben\u00edtez's relations with the Americans, with constant rumours linking the Spaniard with a move back to Real Madrid. Ben\u00edtez, however, said that his future was at Liverpool and signalled his long-term intentions by appointing Sammy Lee as his new assistant to replace his long-time right-hand man, Pako Ayestar\u00e1n, who quit after a reported disagreement, which Ben\u00edtez admitted \"hurt\" him and arguably Liverpool's titles hopes."]}, {"page": "Boys from the Blackstuff", "response": ["This is the most widely discussed episode of the series, following Yosser's struggle to avoid losing his children (who are played by Alan Bleasdale's own children) to the authorities as his mental health disintegrates.
