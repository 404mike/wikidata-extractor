Wilson played the first 23 matches of the 1977\u201378 season, all but one in the starting eleven, when a motor accident left him in hospital for several weeks. Suggestions that his career was over proved wrong, and he returned at the beginning of the 1978\u201379 season in the Second Division, to which Preston had been promoted in his absence. After eight league starts, he fell out of contention, and in the following season, he made twelve league starts, the last of which was on 21 December 1979."]}]}}
