He left the Tomorrow's World programme in 1977, after disagreements with its new editor, Michael Blakstad, who described Baxter as \"the last of the dinosaurs\", while Baxter reputedly said he could not work with someone who arrived at the BBC each day on a bicycle."]}, {"page": "Sally James (presenter)", "response": ["James was one of the presenters of the first series of TVS show Ultra Quiz (1983), alongside Michael Aspel and Jonathan King.
