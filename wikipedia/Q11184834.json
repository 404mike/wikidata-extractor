He was one of the notable bowlers of the 1850s and was frequently among the leading wicket-takers.  He bowled right-arm fast roundarm and is known to have occasionally used fast underarm deliveries, but he is said to have varied his pace.  He batted right-handed and was an occasional wicket-keeper.\nGrundy's known first-class career spanned the 1850 to 1869 seasons.  He took 1,137 wickets in 298 matches with a bowling average of 12.81 with a best analysis of 9/19.  He had 84 5-wicket innings and 24 10-wicket matches.  He scored 5,898 runs with the bat at an average of 12.65 with a highest score of 95.  He took 233 catches and made 2 stumpings.\nIn 1857, he became the first person to be given out handled the ball.At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Grundy was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1852 in sports", "response": ["* The United All England Eleven (UEE) is established as a rival to William Clarke's All-England Eleven (AEE).

In that document, it stated that \"If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still, unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket Keeper, its out.\" Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later. The first batsman to be dismissed for handling the ball in first-class cricket was James Grundy, who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857. Prior to 1899, a batsman could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing. At the time, if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batsman's clothing, they could claim a catch.Brodribb (1995), p. 229. It was in such a situation that George Bennett, the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket, was dismissed in 1872. The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as \"most unusual\". In a match between the smokers and the non-smokers involved in the 1886\u201387 Ashes series, Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest. Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high-scoring match, he defended the delivery and picked the ball up.
