His mother, Mary, a daughter of Dr. Brandreth of Houghton Regis, and the widow of Arthur Turner, would not allow her son to be sent to a public school, and he was educated by himself, a circumstance which engendered in him habits of isolation and restraint. At an early age he cultivated poetry, two small selections from his effusions circulating among his friends before he was twenty-three. Bray became a student at the Middle Temple in 1801 and was called to the bar in 1806. For some time he went the western circuit, but the profession of the law had from the first ill accorded with his disposition, and after five years of trial he abandoned it for the Church. He was ordained by the Bishop of Norwich about 1811, and in the following year, by the favour of the Duke of Bedford, became the vicar of St Eustachius' Church, Tavistock and the perpetual curate of Brent Tor. Almost immediately after his ordination he entered himself at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity as a ten-year man in 1822. He lived in Tavistock for the rest of his life, and if he differed from his parishioners on politics or preached over their heads, he retained their respect. In 1822 he married Anna Eliza, the widow of Charles Alfred Stothard, and an amusing account of the habits of the worthy vicar and his wife is embodied in the latter's autobiography. Bray died at Tavistock 17 July 1857. During his lifetime he published several selections of sermons:\n\nSermons from the Works of the most eminent Divines of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries, 1818\nDiscourses from Tracts and Treatises of Eminent Divines, 1821\nSelect Sermons by Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, 1823\nDiscourses on Protestantism, 1829 (his own sermons)His poetical productions were for the most part circulated privately. After Bray's death his widow collected and published his Poetical Remains (1859, 2 vols), and also A Selection from the Sermons, General and Occasional, of Rev. E. A. Bray (1860, 2 vols). At one time he projected a history of his native town of Tavistock, and made considerable collections for it, but the undertaking was never completed. Many extracts from his journals describing the curiosities of Dartmoor and many of his poems are inserted in his wife's A Description of the Part of Devonshire Bordering on the Tamar and the Tavy (1836). When she published her work on Switzerland she embodied with it many passages in the diary which her husband kept whilst on the tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anna Eliza Bray", "response": ["A year or two after Stothard died, Anna Eliza married Edward Atkyns Bray, Vicar of Tavistock. She then began writing historical novels, and from 1826 to 1874 produced at least a dozen. Some, such as The Talba, or the Moor of Portugal (1830) deal with foreign life, but her most popular ones revived the principal families of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, such as the Trelawneys of Trelawne, the Pomeroys, and the Courtenays of Walreddon. They proved so popular that a set of ten volumes by Longmans appeared in 1845\u20131846 and was reprinted by Chapman & Hall as late as 1884. While she was living in Tavistock, Bray discovered and took up a young lady's maid, Mary Colling, who had produced a book of poetry, which Bray saw was published."]}, {"page": "Edward Atkyns (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Atkyns Bray (1778\u20131857), English poet"]}, {"page": "Edward Bray", "response": ["*Edward Atkyns Bray (1778\u20131857), British poet, vicar, and miscellaneous writer"]}, {"page": "Bray, Edward", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Atkyns Bray"]}, {"page": "Mary Colling", "response": ["She was born Mary Maria Colling on 20 August 1804 to Edmund Colling and Anne, n\u00e9e Domville in Tavistock, Devon. Her father was husbandman and assistant to the surveyor of the highways and she was baptised on 2 September 1804. She was educated locally from the age of ten, at a dame-school where she learned to read and write and do needlework. She got a position when she was fourteen as a lady's maid. She drew the attention of Anna Eliza Bray in 1831 and shared her poems, one inspired around 1825 by Rev. Edward Atkyns Bray on hearing him preach about \"power of God manifested in the creation of the world\". Bray assisted her in getting her work published and considered her a friend though the vast difference between their classes at the time prevented a closer relationship and when later publishing her letters Bray edited them to remove the specific reference to Colling as her friend though keeping in her admiration of her. Her only book of poems published was Fables and other Pieces in Verse which included the teaching of values and descriptions of rural life. Bray shared her discovery of this poet with Robert Southey, poet laureate. Colling developed medical issues later and spent time in an asylum. She lived with her parents in Tavistock and died of dropsy aged only forty eight, on 6 August 1853."]}]}}
