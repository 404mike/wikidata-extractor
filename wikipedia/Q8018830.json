(1975) and Ph.D. (1978) in Microbiology, University College Cardiff, Wales, and after an AFRC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (1978) at the University of Dundee, with  William Stewart, was appointed to a Lectureship in Microbiology (1979). He was promoted to a Personal Chair in Microbiology in 1995 and became Head of the Department of Biological Sciences in 1999. He is a former Deputy Research Director of the School of Life Sciences (2000-2006), Head of the Division of Environmental and Applied Biology (2000-2007), Division of Molecular and Environmental Microbiology (2007-2009), and was founding Head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology (2009). Geoffrey Gadd currently holds the Boyd Baxter Chair of Biology at the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee  and leads the Geomicrobiology Group. Research is in the field of geomicrobiology and particularly the roles of fungi, and other microorganisms, in metal-mineral interactions and transformations, and their relevance to environmental processes, element cycling, mineral formation or dissolution, and bioremediation and element biorecovery. Most research has concentrated on fungi and has ranged from cellular and biochemical aspects to the environment and biotechnology, with other significant research on sulfate-reducing bacterial systems for metal bioremediation. Original contributions relate to establishing the field of geomycology within geomicrobiology, and the multidisciplinary research outputs at the interface of microbiology, mineralogy, and geochemistry have greatly furthered understanding of the processes underlying metal and radionuclide accumulation, detoxification and tolerance, mechanisms affecting metal mobility in the environment, mineral dissolution, the formation of biogenic minerals, and biodeterioration of the built environment and cultural heritage. The environmental and biotechnological significance of these phenomena is a consistent focus."]}]}}
