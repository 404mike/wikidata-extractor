The arrival of Irish immigrants in the area necessitated the construction of a larger house of worship. By 1839 enough money had been collected to make a start and the present site in St George's Fields (then an open space) was purchased for \u00a33,200."]}, {"page": "Thomas Doyle", "response": ["* Thomas Doyle (Australian politician) (1885\u20131951), New South Wales politician", "* Thomas Doyle (Canadian politician) (1932\u20132007), politician in Newfoundland, Canada", "* A.
