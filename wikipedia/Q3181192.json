Improved editions by Samuel Patrick, John Ward, William Young of Gillingham, Isaac Kimber (editing 1751) and Thomas Morell successively appeared; Ward and Young's (1752) in folio, the others in quarto. Nathaniel Thomas's version was from 1758. John Carey's (1816) was a later version; there were also abridgments by Young and Morell. Another 19th-century edition was that of Benjamin Wrigglesworth Beatson with William Ellis, based on the 1752 edition."]}, {"page": "Peredur son of Efrawg", "response": ["Like the other Welsh Romances, scholars debate as to the work's exact relationship to Chr\u00e9tien's poem. It is possible Peredur preserves some of the material found in Chr\u00e9tien's source. The sequence of some events are altered in Peredur, and many original episodes appear, including the reign in Constantinople, which contains remnants of a sovereignty tale. The grail (Old French graal) is replaced with a severed head on a platter, reflecting stories of Bran the Blessed from the Mabinogion. Despite these seemingly-traditional elements, however, influence from the French romance cannot be discounted. As John Carey notes, there are significant phrase-for-phrase parallels between Chretien's poem and Peredur, especially in the conversation between Gawain/Gwalchmai and Perceval/Peredur that occurs after Gawain/Gwalchmai covers the blood on the snow which reminds Perceval/Peredur of his love (Blancheflor in Chretien). Moreover, the black-haired hag describes the bleeding spear Peredur saw earlier in the tale as a small spear carried by one youth with a single drop running down (like Chretien), but this is different from how the relevant earlier passage in Peredur depicts it, which is as a gigantic spear carried by two youths and bleeding three drops.Carey, John.
