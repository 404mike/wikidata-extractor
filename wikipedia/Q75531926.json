He issued a public order forbidding Menorcan people to visit or communicate with them, and placed HSB under house arrest. His butler was stabbed in the arm with a bayonet when the guards posted at his front door mistook him for HSB. His youngest son, Edward Blanckley joined the Royal Navy as midshipman on 17 January 1805. HSB sought British aid to evacuate the rest of his family from Menorca, and was informed that the 38-gun frigate Seahorse would collect them.

This account pushes the Blanckley-Raleigh lineage tradition back as far as Ann Elizabeth and HSB\u2019s parents\u2019 generation. The author's belief that the male Blanckley line had died out by the time of authorship in 1877 suggests that the Shaw's family story of desecent from Raleigh was independent from stories held by Edward Blanckley\u2019s line, as his son, Horatio Charles Nelson Blanckley lived until 1899.", ":\"My maternal grandfather, the late Henry Staniforth (or Stanyford) Blanckley, Esq., formerly a major in the army, and for many years consul-general in the Balearic Islands and at Algiers, was lineally descended from Sir Walter Raleigh, and possessed many interesting relics of his great ancestor. He also possessed some portion of Sir Walter's estates in the county of Cork ; these, however, came to him with his wife, who was his first cousin, and also of the Raleigh line. Her name was Rogers. A small estate called Cooly-cussane is all that now remains in the Blanckley family of this Irish property. My grandfather possessed the ring which Sir Walter wore on the scaffold, and it is now in the possession of his eldest son's son, Captain Edward James Blanckley, of the 6th Foot. He also had an iron-gilt despatch-box, covered with velvet, once crimson ; this, together with Sir Walter's teapot of red earth, silver mounted, went to his younger son, the late Captain Edward Blanckley, RN., and both articles are now in the hands of his widow.\""]}]}}
