He showed the following year in an NAACP-sponsored group exhibition held at the Nordness Gallery in Manhattan. Other exhibitors included Norman Lewis, Charles McGee, Felrath Hines, Alma W. Thomas, Walter Williams. At the same time his work appeared in a group of seventeen artists at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota and at about this time he showed at the Margaret Dickey Gallery in the District. In 1971 a solo exhibition at the Jefferson Place Gallery called \"Mirror Compositions\" drew favorable criticism in both the Washington Post and Jet magazine. Another solo, this at the Corcoran, followed in 1974 and in the same year his work appeared in group shows at the Whitney and Brooklyn Museums. That year he also executed a commission for a 40-foot-long mural for the psychiatric ward of D.C. General Hospital. He subsequently showed in Washington commercial spaces, including the Middendorf, Fraser, and Fiedler galleries. "]}]}}
