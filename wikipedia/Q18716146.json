Billy Bennett replaced Wigmore in the forward line. Playing against a strong wind, McRoberts opened the scoring when he was first to the rebound after his shot was fumbled, and Bennett converted a cross from Sid Wharton not long before the interval. Persistent attacking led to further goals, from Harry Wilcox and Walter Main, before the visitors' Herbert Munday scored when the ball rebounded off the crossbar. Main scored his second, and the home team's fifth, from a sweeping passing move, then Chesterfield made the final score 5\u20133.\"Small Heath v. Chesterfield\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 18 September 1899. On a pitch made slippery by a thunderstorm before kickoff, the visitors had Nat Robinson to thank for keeping Gainsborough Trinity at bay; the home side protested that one shot \"scooped out\" by Robinson had in fact crossed the line. Then McRoberts scored a solo goal, Trinity's goalkeeper allowed Wharton's shot from distance to slip through his hands into the net, and Wharton made the half-time score 3\u20130 after a move between McRoberts and Wigmore left him a tap-in. Freddie Fenton pulled one back with a header after Robinson missed his punch, and Bennett made the final score 4\u20131 after the goalkeeper failed to hold a low shot.\"Gainsbro' Trinity v. Small Heath\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 25 September 1899. It was confirmed that Leake had gone to Manchester for specialist treatment on damaged ankle ligaments. At home to Bolton Wanderers, relegated from the First Division in 1899, the defence was worked hard from the outset, but Small Heath \"began to wake up\", and the attack went to the other end, John Willie Sutcliffe playing \"grandly\", particularly when the visitors temporarily went down to ten men. In heavy rain in the second half, the defences had the upper hand, and the game finished goalless.\"Small Heath v. Bolton Wanderers\". The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent: p.8. 2 October 1899. With four wins and a draw, Small Heath went into October in third place in the league, two points behind Leicester Fosse having played one game fewer."]}, {"page": "Frank Hilton", "response": ["Born at Worsbrough, two miles south of Barnsley, Yorkshire, Hilton's family moved to the Balby area of Doncaster when he was a child. He featured prominently in Bristol City's successes in the first decade of the 20th century under Manager Harry Thickett. He played for local club Doncaster St Johns in Yorkshire before Harry Thickett signed him in July 1905 for Bristol City in the Second Division. He made his league debut in 3\u20130 win at Lincoln City on 28 October 1905 when Bristol City were in the midst of a record run of 14 successive league wins. Hilton made 26 appearances scoring five goals at outside left replacing Freddie Fenton in 1905\u201306 when Bristol City finished Second Division champions. In the next season 1906\u201307 when Bristol City finished as runners up in the First Division, Hilton contributed four goals from 32 appearances on the left wing. In the following two seasons in the First Division, Hilton was the regular outside left making 30 appearances scoring five goals in 1907\u201308 and 27 appearances scoring seven goals in 1908\u201309. Although not a prolific goalscorer, Hilton scored goals in four successive First Division matches, all won by Bristol City, during December 1908. Hilton became the first Bristol City player to be honoured by the Football League, playing and scoring in the representative XI in a 6\u20133 win over the Irish League at Roker Park on 12 October 1907. In 1908\u201309, Hilton played in only four of the ten FA Cup ties but this included the 1909 FA Cup Final losing 0\u20131 to Manchester United at the Crystal Palace ground, the only final appearance to date by Bristol City. He made his final league appearance in 1909\u201310 in the 1\u20133 defeat at Newcastle United on 23 October 1909. Hilton left Bristol City in the summer of 1910 before the 1910\u201311 season when Bristol City were relegated back to the Second Division. On 30 July 1910 Sheffield sports paper the Star Green 'Un announced that Frank Hilton had signed for Rotherham Town, then of the Midland League. The 1911 UK census confirmed Hilton's occupation as a \"professional footballer\", listed under his formal name           \"Francis Hilton\", and showed that he had returned to his parents house at 56 Carr Hill, Balby, Doncaster. Hilton's football career at Rotherham Town has not been traced any further than 1912 - newspapers of the day reveal that he was still playing for them as recently as the first half of the 1912/13 season. When his playing days drew to a close, he became a licensed victualler and hotel owner in Yorkshire - firstly in Doncaster (until the early 1930s), then later in the Sheffield area. He married Phyllis Marian Beckett at Doncaster in February 1914, and as it appears, died in Sheffield in 1942 - at the age of 60. The 1939 England and Wales Register shows the Hiltons living at 22 Watsons Walk, Sheffield. Frank's occupation is given as a \"Licensed Victualler of Hotel, Proprietor & Caterer\". It also revealed Frank's stated date of birth - March 28, 1882."]}, {"page": "Peter Chambers (footballer)", "response": ["Chambers was born in Workington in 1878 where he helped the local club Black Diamonds to win both the Cumberland League and Cup.
