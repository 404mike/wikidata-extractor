She believed that in the video, Madonna taking off her sunglasses symbolized herself as a movie star, thus creating an ambiguous characterization of herself, and a narcissistic theme. Author Peter Goodwin, in his book Television under the Tories: Broadcasting Policy 1979\u20131997, commented that although \"Lucky Star\" is not a narrative video, in the clip Madonna plays at least four characters:\u2014the person in sunglasses looking; a break-dancing girl; an androgynous social dancer; and a seductress. The juxtaposition of all these characterizations portray Madonna as a narcissistic self-lover. Images of Madonna's body writhing against the white background generates the question whether she is addressing her lover or herself in the song. Adam Sexton, author of Desperately Seeking Madonna: In Search of the Meaning of the World's Most Famous Woman, noted that although the video seems to be made for a \"male fetishistic gaze\", Madonna takes control of \"what is to be looked at and how is to be looked at\" by mockingly opening her mouth and flicking her tongue. For The Quietus, Matthew Lindsay opined the video was a showcase for \"Madonna as auto-erotic magnet [...] full of belly button close-ups and narcissistic strutting\". Times John Skow noted that \"[s]he's sexy, but she doesn't need men [...] she's kind of there all by herself\"."]}, {"page": "Dr Peter Goodwin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Goodwin"]}, {"page": "List of faculty and alumni of John Carroll University", "response": ["*Peter Goodwin \u2013 former dean, World's Strongest Man"]}, {"page": "Goodwin, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Goodwin"]}]}}
