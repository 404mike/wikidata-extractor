It was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left. It had the effect of turning House and West into rivals. The second building stage (1888\u20131894) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge). In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of Daphne Park, Principal from 1980 to 1989."]}, {"page": "Wycliffe Hall, Oxford", "response": ["thumb|left|The original part of Wycliffe Hall - 54 Banbury Road, 'Laleham' The hall - No.54 Banbury Road was designed by John Gibbs in 1866 and built for Tom Arnold the younger, literary scholar and son of Tom Arnold the elder, head of Rugby School.  The house, named \"Laleham\", after the Arnolds' former residence in Middlesex, was larger than normal, even in a neighbourhood known for substantial houses. This size was to accommodate Arnold's anticipated in-house tutees.  Within a decade, Arnold decided to sell No.54 as the tutorial business was abandoned.  A committee of evangelical churchmen bought the property in 1877 and promptly renamed it Wycliffe Hall.  In the early years, the northerly main room was the library-cum-lecture room, while the southerly one was the dining room.  Additions were soon made to the house by William Wilkinson and Harry Wilkinson Moore in 1882\u20131883.  The new North Wing contained a dozen additional student rooms, while South Wing, housed the hall's purpose-built library as well as a new front entrance, thus allowing the dining room to be extended into the hall of No.54.  A new purpose-built dining hall was built on the road-side (i.e. west) of No.54 Banbury Road in 1913, blocking off both of the original main entrances to the hall (the 1866 and 1883 doors), but providing a new front door featuring the hall and university shields in the stonework doorframe, still visible today.  South Wing was converted for use as an additional common room (the LCR) in 1974, while the dining hall was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1980."]}, {"page": "O2 Academy Oxford", "response": ["The red brick building at 190-196 Cowley Road in southeast Oxford was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in 1907 for the Oxford Co-operative Society.
