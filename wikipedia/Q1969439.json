In the First World War he was awarded the Military Cross in 1918 whilst serving as a junior officer in the Machine Gun Corps. During the Second World War he served with 1st Parachute Brigade and then the 6th Airborne Division during the D-Day landings and Operation Tonga in 1944.

Later large scale drops, such as those on the Rhine under Operation Varsity and involving the British 6th and the US 17th, were successful, but less ambitious in their intent to seize ground. After the war, there was fierce debate within the cash-strapped British armed forces as to the value of airborne forces. Many noted the unique contribution they had made within the campaign.See for example, Gale, Richard, With the 6th Airborne Division in Normandy, Sampson Low: London, 1948. Others pointed to the extreme costs involved and the need for strict prioritisation.Slessor, John \"Some Reflections on Airborne Forces\" Army Quarterly, 1948, p164. During the debate, the contribution of British airborne forces in the Far Eastern theatres was perhaps underplayed,See for example their contribution to General Slim's Burma campaign. to the long term detriment of the argument."]}, {"page": "Operation Tonga", "response": ["The paratroopers and glider-borne airborne troops of the division, commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near to the city of Caen, tasked with a number of objectives. The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place, destroy several other bridges to deny their use to the Germans and secure several important villages. The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery, an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces, which could bombard the nearest invasion beach (codenamed Sword) and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it. Having achieved these objectives, the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces."]}, {"page": "Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe", "response": ["Four exercises were conducted in the ACE area during autumn 1952.
