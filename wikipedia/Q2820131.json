He was one of the mutineers who set Hudson adrift in a small boat, and then returned to England, eventually being one of only eight sailors who made it back to England alive. He was tried in 1618, but the authorities did not want to execute those who had saved the expedition and did not prosecute them for mutiny, but for murder. The court found that it was not murder to turn experienced seamen adrift near a shore that was neither barren nor uninhabited and acquitted Pricket.\nPricket is best known for writing a detailed account of Captain Hudson's journey to North America and the subsequent mutiny. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Hudson", "response": ["In the latter class was ship's navigator, Abacuk Pricket, a survivor who kept a journal that was to become one of the sources for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. The latter, a navigator, had accompanied Hudson on the 1609 expedition, and his account is said to be \"the best contemporary record of the voyage\". Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen\u2014men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson\u2014adrift from the Discovery in a small shallop, an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items."]}, {"page": "Habakkuk (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Abacuk Pricket, English mutineer (Abacuk is the spelling used in the Wycliffe Bible)"]}, {"page": "Pricket", "response": ["* Abacuk Pricket, English seaman of the 16th/17th century"]}, {"page": "Prickett", "response": ["*Abacuk Pricket, English sailor"]}, {"page": "Abacuck Pricket", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abacuk Pricket"]}]}}
