Born in Quorn, South Australia, he was educated at state schools before becoming a farmer and grazier. He served in the military from 1914 to 1918, during World War I. In 1924, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Burra Burra. He was defeated in 1927, but held the seat again from 1930 to 1933.\nHe transferred to the federal House of Representatives in 1938, winning a by-election for the seat of Wakefield caused by the death of the sitting United Australia Party member, Charles Hawker.  McHugh faced long odds on paper.  He needed a seemingly daunting 13 percent swing to win the seat, and his UAP opponent was former South Australian Premier Richard Layton Butler.  However, on the third count, independent Percy Quirke's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to McHugh, allowing McHugh to take the seat on a shocking 20 percent swing.  The seat's conservative nature reasserted itself in the 1940 election, when McHugh was defeated by UAP challenger Jack Duncan-Hughes, the former member for Boothby. McHugh returned to state politics, winning the seat of Light in 1941 and holding it until 1944. He died in 1952.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Division of Wakefield", "response": ["| Sydney McHugh"]}, {"page": "List of Australian federal by-elections", "response": ["|Sydney McHugh "]}, {"page": "Richard Layton Butler", "response": ["Butler went into the by-election as a heavy favorite; on paper Wakefield was a safely conservative seat with a UAP/LCL majority of 13.1 percent.

This allowed McHugh to take the seat on a swing of 20 percent.  Although he continued to seek federal pre-selection for the LCL, internal party opponents thwarted him. Instead, after being knighted in 1939, Butler was first appointed by Playford to the critical wartime positions of Director of Emergency Road Transport and Chair of the Liquid Fuel Control Board and later as a Director of the Electricity Trust of South Australia."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Light", "response": ["| Sydney McHugh "]}, {"page": "Tony Piccolo", "response": ["Piccolo won Light at the 2006 election with a 52.1 percent two-party-preferred vote from a swing of 4.9 points against the incumbent Liberal member, Malcolm Buckby.
