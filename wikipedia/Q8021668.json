On 8 May in the first game, Queens thrashed Dumfries 7\u20131. A week later they saw off Solway Star 4\u20130 in the semi-final. They then faced up in the final against side Dalbeattie Star. A then-record crowd of 4,500 (with many others situated upon the stadium's roof) watched the game. An early Halliday shot went wide following good link up play with Ian Dickson. However it was Dalbeattie with their physical style of play who took the lead. Queens equalised through Willie McCall before Halliday's play became fruitful. One shot hit the post, another went inches wide before he put Queens ahead five minutes before half time. Connell hit a third a minute into the second half before Halliday beat Borthwick to cross for McCall who scored a fourth goal."]}, {"page": "William McCall", "response": ["*Willie McCall (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131966), Scottish footballer", "*Willie McCall (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131985), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Willie McCall (footballer born 1898)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Willie McCall (footballer, born 1898)"]}, {"page": "Matthew Cornock", "response": ["He signed for Albion Rovers, also of Division Two, for the 1924\u201325 season, but was not there long.
