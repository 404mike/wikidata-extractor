Wentworth Eldredge, a sociology professor at nearby Dartmouth College, and his wife Diana.  They chose to name their home Tarn House, possibly an allusion to Diana's Scottish heritage (she was the daughter of Sir William Younger, 1st Baronet, of Auchen Castle).  The house was designed by Ted and Margaret Hunter, architects with a practice in Hanover, New Hampshire.  Both of the Hunters had studied architecture at Harvard University under Walter Gropius, and had adopted his Internationalist style for much of their work.  This house, with its rectilinear design, flat roof, and harmonious setting in the landscape, is a good example of principles Gropius espoused."]}]}}
