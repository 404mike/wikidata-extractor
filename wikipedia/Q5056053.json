He was beaten again at the by-election in 1925 following the death of his Unionist successor Sir Arthur Henniker-Hughan, but regained the seat at the 1929 general election.\nWhen Parliament was dissolved for the 1931 general election, Dudgeon resigned from the Liberal Party and contested the election as a New Party candidate. He finished 4th of 4 candidates, with 986 votes (a 2.0% share). He did not stand for Parliament again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Party (UK)", "response": ["The New Party's first electoral contest was at the Ashton-under-Lyne by-election in April 1931. The candidate was Allan Young, and his election agent was Wilfred Risdon. With a threadbare organisation they polled some 16% of the vote, splitting the Labour vote and allowing a Conservative to be returned to the Commons. Two more MPs joined the New party later in 1931: W.E.D. Allen from the Unionists and Cecil Dudgeon from the Liberals. At the 1931 general election the New Party contested 25 seats, but only Mosley himself, and a candidate in Merthyr Tydfil (Sellick Davies stood against only one Independent Labour Party (ILP) candidate in Merthyr, while Mosley stood against both Conservative and Labour candidates in Stoke) polled a decent number of votes, and three candidates lost their deposits. Mosley's New Party general election campaign received prominent press coverage in various national newspapers during 1931 with the Manchester Guardian reporting that \"The stewards were wearing rosettes of black and amber \u2013 the Mosley colours. Busy bees, hiving the honey of prosperity? That may be the symbolism of it.\""]}, {"page": "Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Cecil Dudgeon", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Cecil Dudgeon"]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* Cecil Dudgeon, Galloway, 1922\u201324, 29\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cecil Dudgeon"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Cecil Dudgeon"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Cecil Dudgeon"]}, {"page": "Arthur Henniker-Hughan", "response": ["Some five years after his retirement from the navy, Henniker-Hughan stood for Parliament as a Unionist candidate at the 1924 General Election, winning the Galloway seat from the incumbent member, Cecil Dudgeon.
