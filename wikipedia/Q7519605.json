His style is associated with that of his contemporary Howard Skempton and has been compared to younger composer Simon Rackham,Music and Musicians International, Volume 37 Filmtrax, 1988 p. 100 who released a piece for two pianos called 'Warhorse' dedicated to the memory of Patrick Morris on his 2011 album, Once In a Blue Moonlight."]}, {"page": "Lucifer (British band)", "response": ["In 1997 Cheater Slicks included a cover version of Lucifer's \"Hypnosis\" on their double CD Forgive Thee (ITR 054).

Since the re-release of Big Gun by Dynamic, every mention of Lucifer seems to include the reference to it being the work of the \"acid-ravaged mind of Peter 'Lucifer' Walker ex-The Purple Gang\". This unfounded attribution appears to come from the Rock Encyclopedia books by Vernon Joynson, but he gives no sources for his information, and Julian Cope also makes this error in his 2006 Head Heritage Exit LP review.
