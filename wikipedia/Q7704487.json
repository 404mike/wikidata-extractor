On 4 May 1983, a week before the opening weekend, Montreal faced the Atlanta Apollos in a pilot contest erroneously reported as the debut of indoor soccer in the United States, losing 8-6.  This an exhibition match was actually two years after the first officially sanctioned indoor variant by the North American Soccer League, the 1971 NASL Professional Hoc-Soc Tournament.  Montreal hosted three international teams during the summer of 1973, losing the first 3-1 to Finn Harps F.C. with Terry Harkin, who would spend the rest of the summer on loan with the Toronto Metros, scoring all three goals for the Irish team.    It was the Harps only win against a professional team during their North American tour.  In July, the team drew 1-1 against Mexican team C.D. Veracruz and lost four goals to none to FC Torpedo Moscow in a friendly held after the conclusion of the NASL season, a match which would turn out to be the team's last game. Montreal finished the 1973 season with a record of five wins, four draws and ten losses.  In last September 1973, it was reported that the contracts of both GM Koerner and coach Adams had not been renewed and team owner Sam Berger announced that if the team did not find a suitable stadium for soccer, the club would not continue.

People such as Terry Harkin, Tony O'Doherty, Eamon McLaughlin and Eddie Mahon, having worked on the visionary project since 1983, helped in the bid to secure senior status once again for Derry City with an election to the League of Ireland's First Division in May 1985. However, the IFA still saw the chance to thwart Derry City once again. The FIFA vice-president (also the IFA's president), Harry Cavan, who had been instrumental in banning the Brandywell from being used for European competition in 1964, claimed that FIFA rules did not permit Derry crossing the border to play in the league of another country. In Dublin, people were undecided about admitting a club from a city with a recent history of political problems but the Finn Harps chairman, Fran Fields, fully backed Derry's application and Glentoran chairman, John Crossen, was another prominent supporter of Derry's move as he felt that the time had come for the IFA to refrain from acting as they had done previously.

In December, Hancock was sold to Ipswich Town for \u00a310,000.

Steele tried to play a settled team, but that proved to be as unsuccessful as when he switched the team round constantly. By the end of the month the club were bottom of the league and morale was low. In mid-February, the club four points short of safety, Steele left the club 'by mutual consent', as Jackie Mudie was appointed caretaker manager. Following a 4\u20130 hammering from Gillingham, Mudie signed veteran stopper Jimmy O'Neill from Darlington, and the former Ireland international seemed to improve the team, as just two defeats in eight games followed. Mudie instilled discipline into the team, and so was made manager on a permanent basis on 3 March. He then ensured Reg Davies was transferred to Leyton Orient.
