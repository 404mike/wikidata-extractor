There were no new names in the Bristol City team that took the field in the opening game a 2\u20131 win v Swansea Town on 20 August 1955 which was the Second Division debut for Atyeo. Two days later Atyeo scored the first of many goals in the Second Division in a 3\u20131 win at Rotherham United. Atyeo played at inside right throughout the season with Eisentrager as his regular right wing partner until Pat Beasley signed Wally Hinshelwood for \u00a315,000 from Reading in February 1956. Jimmy Rogers had his most productive goalscoring season with 25 goals from centre forward. Tommy Burden provided the skill and drive at inside left and Jack Boxley was on the left wing completing the regular forward line. Atyeo missed only 3 league games, all of which were defeats, two against Leeds United. Atyeo had a productive first half of the season scoring 20 goals in his first 19 games as the \"Robins\" stormed to the top of the table in mid November and remained at the summit until Christmas Eve. Atyeo scored a hat-trick (including a penalty) in a 3\u20131 win v Bury on 17 September and another hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win v Lincoln City on 3 December. City only won seven more league games after the win over Lincoln City and finished in 11th position in the final Second Division table as Atyeo scored only 10 more goals in the remaining 20 matches, still a good goals per game ratio. Overall Atyeo made 39 appearances and scored 30 goals in the league recording the highest total of league goals in a season in his career. This is the closest Atyeo came to the Bristol City record for goals in a season held by Don Clark with 36 goals in 1946\u201347. In the FA Cup a crowd of 46,493 saw City defeated 1\u20133 in the 3rd round at Everton. However the 46,713 who witnessed the 1\u20132 league defeat at Liverpool became the largest crowd to watch Atyeo in Bristol City colours, that is, until the following season. Frankfurt, Nice and Stuttgart Kickers were the European teams welcomed to Ashton Gate for first team friendlies with Atyeo a regular scorer in the friendlies."]}, {"page": "2014 in association football", "response": ["* 21 August: Don Clark, English footballer (born 1917)"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 in English football", "response": ["*Don Clark (Bristol City) \u2013 36 goals"]}, {"page": "Don Clark", "response": ["*Don Clark (footballer) (1917\u20132014), English association football player", "*Don Clark (American football) (1923\u20131989), American football player and coach, head football coach at the University of Southern California", "*Don Clark (Canadian football) (born 1936), running back in the Canadian Football League", "*Don Clark (psychologist) (born 1930), clinical psychologist who has specialized in group and individual work with gay people", "*Don Clark (musician) (born 1975), guitarist of Christian metal band Demon Hunter", "* Don Clarke (1933\u20132002), rugby union player"]}]}}
