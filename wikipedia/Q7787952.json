He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm round-arm medium-fast bowler who played for Sussex. He was born in Ampthill and died in Isleworth.\nBrown first appeared for his home county of Bedfordshire in a miscellaneous match in 1882. Brown played eight years later for Sussex in the County Championship, making his debut against Yorkshire. Despite playing lower in the order, he performed well, hitting his best first-class score in just his second first-class innings.\nIn spite of Brown's early good form, he, along with the rest of the team, crumbled in a game against Lancashire in which Sussex made 35 all out and 24 all out in a heavy innings defeat \u2013 the latter of which remains one of the lowest totals in the club's first-class history.\nBrown played in two more County Championship matches in the 1890 season, both of which finished in innings defeats for the side. Following his retirement from playing the game, Brown later umpired two matches in the 1901 Minor Counties Championship season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Brown", "response": ["Thomas Brown may refer to:", "*Thomas Brown (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u20131936), English cricketer", "*Thomas Brown (cricketer, born 1845) (1845\u2013?), English cricketer", "*Thomas Brown (cricketer, born 1848) (1848\u20131919), English cricketer", "*Thomas Brown (cricketer, born 1863) (1863\u20131930), English cricketer", "*Thomas Brown (sport shooter) (1885\u20131950), American Olympic sport shooter", "*Thomas Brown (rugby) (born 1983), Welsh rugby union and rugby league player, not to be confused with Tom Brown, born 1990", "*Thomas Brown (defensive end) (born 1957), American football defensive end ", "*Thomas Brown (American football coach) (born 1986), American football running back", "*Thomas Brown (footballer), English footballer", "*Thomas Brown (footballer, born 1898) (1898-1979), English footballer for Middlesbrough and Accrington Stanley", "*Thomas Brown (Florida politician) (1785\u20131867), American politician, second Governor of Florida, 1849\u20131853", "*Thomas Brown (New South Wales politician) (1861\u20131934), Australian farmer and politician", "*Thomas Brown (New South Wales colonial politician) (1811\u20131889), New South Wales politician", "*Thomas Brown (settler) (1803\u20131863), Australian pastoralist and politician", "*Thomas Brunce (c. 1388\u20131445), also known as Thomas Brown, English Bishop of Rochester & of Norwich", "*Thomas Brown (martyr), burnt 27 January 1556 at Smithfield, London, during the Marian persecutions", "*Thomas Brown (bishop) (born 1943), Anglican bishop in New Zealand", "*Thomas Brown (minister) (1811\u20131893), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1890", "*Thomas Brown (architect) (1781\u20131850), Scottish architect", "*Thomas Brown (prison architect) (1806\u20131872), Scottish architect", "*Thomas Brown (philosopher) (1778\u20131820), Scottish philosopher", "*Thomas Brown (satirist) (1662\u20131704), English satirist", "* Thomas Brown (1779\u20131852), pen name of Thomas Moore", "*Thomas Brown (businessman) (1738\u20131797), American husbandman, businessman, and land speculator", "*Thomas Brown (engineer) (1772\u20131850), English surveyor, engineer, businessman, and landowner", "*Thomas Brown (loyalist) (1750\u20131825), American Revolution commander of King's Rangers in Georgia", "*Thomas Brown of Lanfine and Waterhaughs (1774\u20131853), Scottish botanist and mineralogist, creator of The Lanfine Collection", "*Thomas Brown (naturalist) (1785\u20131862), English naturalist", "*Thomas Brown (officer of arms) (1708\u20131780), Garter Principal King of Arms", "*Thomas Browne (disambiguation)"]}]}}
