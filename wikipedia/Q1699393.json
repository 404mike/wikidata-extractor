His long career led him to become one of Europe's leading opera stars. He also wrote a number of songs, of minor importance, although \"The Death of Nelson\" is still remembered. His success, and that of his offspring in marrying into the British aristocracy, are also notable examples of Jewish social mobility in the early 19th century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
