He was educated in Britain before returning to join his father, the British consul in Samoa. In Samoa, he acquired an exceptional knowledge of the Polynesian language and traditions. In 1858 he was appointed the first British consul at Fiji, and in the same year traveled to England with an offer from Seru Epenisa Cakobau to cede Fiji to the British crown.

Ma'afu shrewdly signed an agreement denying sovereignty over Fijians and claiming to be in the islands only to oversee the Tongan population. Following Britain's decision in 1862 not to annex Fiji, however, Ma'afu resumed his attempts to extend his rule.  In 1867, he created the Tovata Confederacy, covering most of northern and eastern Fiji. This arrangement was not a success, however, and Ma'afu retired to the island of Vanuabalavu. He maintained his claim, however, to be the overseer of the Tongan population, and when the Tui Nayau raised the Tongan flag over Lakeba, Ma'afu took control of the Lau archipelago on the pretext that its Paramount Chief had declared it be Tongan territory, rather than Fijian."]}, {"page": "Tongan megapode", "response": ["The Tongan megapode (Megapodius pritchardii) is a species of bird in the megapode family, Megapodiidae, currently endemic to Tonga.

Unable to pay, Cakobau tried convince the British consul in Fiji, William Thomas Pritchard to pay the debt in exchange for land. Despite having the Great Council of Chiefs' support of the plan, in 1862 the British declined the purchase, fearing Cakobau did not have the authority to offer the land. In 1865 a confederation of chiefs was established to deal with the growing numbers of settlers wanting to purchase land. A constitutional government was established for Bau and Cakobau was crowned in 1867. A group of Melbourne capitalists agreed to pay off the American debt in exchange for lands to colonise, but the venture and Cakobau's government eventually failed. Between 1865 and 1871 five constitutions were drafted for limited districts and none beyond the territories of local chiefs. When the first confederation lapsed in 1867, the Lau Confederation was established under Enele Ma\u02bbafu. It united three chiefdoms, but expired in 1870."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (K\u2013P)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Pritchard\"| William Thomas Pritchard (1829\u20131907), adventurer"]}]}}
