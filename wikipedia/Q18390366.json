Dyce is in Aberdeenshire a few miles north-west of Aberdeen and the quarries were on the side of a hill just outside the village. Because quarrying was not a protected occupation many workmen there had been called up, and it had been possible to persuade the employer to take on the conscientious objectors; he would not be responsible for paying their wages.
