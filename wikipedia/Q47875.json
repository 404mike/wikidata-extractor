He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, but achieved greater commercial success with his solo career, beginning in 1996. Williams has released seven UK number one singles and eleven out of his twelve studio albums have reached number one in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the United Kingdom\u2013four albums in the top 60\u2013and in 2006 he entered the Guinness Book of World Records for selling 1.6 million tickets of his Close Encounters Tour in a single day.Williams has received a record eighteen Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male Artist four times, two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the \"Greatest Artist of the 1990s\". According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Williams has been certified for 19.9 million albums and 8.2 million singles in the UK as a solo artist. Five of his albums have topped the Australian albums chart. He has sold 75 million records worldwide. Williams also topped the 2000\u20132010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK's biggest music event to that point. In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, as well as having a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour.\nAfter a fifteen-year hiatus from the group, he was re-united with Take That on 15 July 2010, co-writing and performing lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time. The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams's solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history, selling 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In late 2011, Take That's frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future. He has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances, and has collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects\u2014including the West End musical The Band.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boy band", "response": ["Individuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on.

Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with funky house, such as Spiller's \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" and Modjo's \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2000.

In addition to that, her song \"Hung Up\" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled ABBA's 1979 song \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her Confessions Tour also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the roller derby. In 2006, Jessica Simpson released her album A Public Affair inspired on disco and 1980s Music.

Another wave of British mainstream prominence in US music charts came in the mid-1990s with the brief success of Spice Girls, Oasis, Blur and Robbie Williams. At least one British act would appear somewhere on the Hot 100 every week from 2 November 1963 until 20 April 2002, originating with the debut of the Caravelles' \"You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry\". British acts declined in popularity throughout the 1990s, and in the 27 April 2002 issue of Billboard, none of the songs on the Hot 100 were from British artists; that week, only two of the top 100 albums, those of Craig David and Ozzy Osbourne, were from British artists."]}, {"page": "Music video", "response": ["In 2000, the music video for \"Rock DJ\" by Robbie Williams caused controversy due to the graphic nature of the video which features Williams stripping naked then peeling off his skin to reveal bloody flesh, followed by ripping off his muscles and organs until he is nothing but a blood-soaked skeleton. The video was censored in the UK during daytime hours and was broadcast unedited after 10 pm. The video was banned in Dominican Republic due to allegations of satanism."]}]}}
