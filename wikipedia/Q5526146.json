Vom Ca-nhum, employed as a caretaker manager while he was guiding the under-19 squad, had not been able to qualify his side to the final round of the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (even though they won their match against Mongolia). Then, another Englishman, Louis Lancaster, who previously assisted Gary White during his time on the island, was appointed as the main coach to take his first senior management position. However, things got even worse for the Chinese Taipei: in 2019, the team won just one out of the nine matches they played (a 2\u20130 win in a friendly against Hong Kong), and they were prematurely eliminated from the continental qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, losing all of their first five games and getting thrashed by Australia (1\u20137), Kuwait (9\u20130) and Jordan (5\u20130). Following the shocking results in the first phase of the qualifiers, Lancaster was sacked in December 2019, and the federation soon decided to hire Vom Ca-nhum again, this time on a full basis, as he was one of the few coaches on the island to have already gained an AFC Pro A coaching license.", "* Gary White (2017\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "Bahamas Football Association", "response": ["* Gary White  (2000\u20132006)  "]}, {"page": "Mixu Paatelainen", "response": ["Paatelainen was appointed as the head coach of the Hong Kong representative team in April 2019 on a two-year contract, succeeding Gary White.
