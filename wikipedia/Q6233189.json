Their journey around the Moreton Bay area following being blown off course by a cyclone is an epic story in itself. Suffice to say that in their attempt to walk north along the coastline to Sydney (they thought the cyclone had pushed their boat south of Sydney) they followed the south bank of the Brisbane River (around May 1823) upstream through Yeronga to Oxley Creek (originally named Canoe Creek), where they found a bark canoe and used it to travel further north. The present Pamphlett Bridge at that spot honours the member of the party who could swim, as the canoe was on the west bank of the creek."]}, {"page": "Dean Windass", "response": ["Windass remained a controversial character and in September 2006, on FIFA Fair Play Day, he was accused of grabbing fellow professional John Finnigan by the testicles during Bradford City's 2\u20131 win over Cheltenham Town.

He quickly became a fans favourite, scoring his first ever FA Cup goals in Hereford's 2\u20131 revenge win over Brighton, and went on to score a goal in every two games for the Edgar Street side. This was enough for Cheltenham Town to make a \u00a315,000 bid that the financially troubled Bulls couldn't refuse in March 1998. He was instrumental in Cheltenham's promotion to the Football League in 1998\u201399, scoring a spectacular goal against Morecambe, the winner against Rushden & Diamonds in a Conference Championship showdown. He was subsequently named Conference Player of the Year. During the 2001\u20132002 season, he scored one of his most memorable goals, a volley from at least 30 yards at Whaddon Road in the Division 3 game against Plymouth. His last appearances for the club were in the successful 2001\u201302 playoff campaign where he scored a vital equaliser in the semi-finals first leg and scored his penalty in the shootout in the second leg. For his final game for the Robins, at the Millennium Stadium he came on as a substitute and smashed a shot against the post, with recent signing John Finnigan netting the re-bound. He was soon released by the club and then joined non-league side Forest Green Rovers in the Conference."]}, {"page": "Jerry Gill", "response": ["Following a trial at the club, Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non-contract basis until the end of the season. He was given a one-year contract for the 2004\u201305 season and, at the age of 34, played in all 46 league games; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life. Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury. For the following season, he was given another one-year contract, with an option for 2006\u201307 if he managed to play 20 games during the season. Not only did he start twice that number, he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play-offs at the Millennium Stadium. His starting place and winners' medal, achieved with the help of his \"excellent last-ditch defending\", went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final. In addition, his sales experience enabled the players to look smart for the occasion; expecting to be wearing tracksuits for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits, Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set of suits at reasonable cost. While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities, \"If Jerry scores, We're on the pitch, if Jerry scores, We're on the pitch!\" to the tune of Tom Hark."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["Blackpool travelled to Cheltenham seven days later.
