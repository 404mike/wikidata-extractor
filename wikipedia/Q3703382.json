The quarry is the source of 'Iona Marble', a beautiful translucent green and white stone, much used in brooches and other jewellery. The stone has been known of for centuries and was credited with healing and other powers. While the quarry had been used in a small way, it was not until around the end of the 18th century when it was opened up on a more industrial scale by the Duke of Argyle. The then difficulties of extracting the hard stone and transporting it meant that the scheme was short lived. Another attempt was started in 1907, this time more successful with considerable quantities of stone extracted and indeed exported, but the First World War put paid to this as well, with little quarrying after 1914 and the operation finally closing in 1919. A painting showing the quarry in operation, The Marble Quarry, Iona (1909) by David Young Cameron, is in the collection of Cartwright Hall art gallery in Bradford. Such is the site's rarity that it has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument."]}, {"page": "1865 in art", "response": ["* June 28 \u2013 David Young Cameron, Scottish painter (died 1945)"]}, {"page": "Painter and Limner", "response": ["* Sir David Young Cameron: 16 June 1933 \u2013 16 September 1945"]}, {"page": "Glasgow School", "response": ["There were three distinct waves of Glasgow Boys.

John Duncan, the arts and crafts artist, was still active in the early twentieth century and painted several landscapes similar in style to those of Cadell and Peploe.MacDonald, Scottish Art, p. 162.
