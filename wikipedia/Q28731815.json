CUCC teams have always had important or first-class cricket status. In 1972 and 1974 the team also played official List A cricket matches.Some CUCC players have been members of teams representing combinations of British Universities or, since 2001, the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (CUCCE), later rebranded the Cambridge MCCU. This team includes students from Anglia Ruskin University, as well as Cambridge University, and plays in some first-class matches. After the establishment of the Cambridge UCCE, the annual three-day first-class University Match against Oxford University Cricket Club was replaced by a one-day match against Oxford at Lord's and a four-day first-class match against Oxford, alternating between Fenner's and The University Parks. The 2020 fixture was the last match with first-class status, although the fixture is still played under first class conditions. This list of players includes only those players who have represented CUCC itself in first-class matches.  Players who have represented the Cambridge UCCE and MCCU In first-class matches can be found in List of Cambridge UCCE & MCCU players.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a CUCC player and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other first-class teams besides CUCC. Players are shown to the end of the 2020 season.\n\nAs of 25 August 2019", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike James", "response": ["Mike James or Michael James may refer to:", "* Michael James, American musician with Explosions in the Sky", "* Michael James (Australian footballer) (born 1971), Australian rules footballer ", "* Michael James (cricketer, born 1934), English cricketer", "* Michael James (cricketer, born 1987), English cricketer", "* Michael James (politician) (1861\u20131943), Canadian politician of the early 20th century", "* Michael James (producer) (born 1962), American record producer, guitarist, and mixing engineer", "* Michael James (quilt artist) (born 1949), American artist", "* Michael James (singer), British singer and songwriter"]}]}}
