His highest score of 28 came in his last match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in June 1901; this was also the scene of the only catch he took in his career, to dismiss John Rawlin.\nHoward was born in Epsom, Surrey; he died at Evenlode House in Gloucestershire at the age of 80.", "link_mentions": {}}}
