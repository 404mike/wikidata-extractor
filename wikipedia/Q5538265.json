He was a lifelong friend and supporter of William Blake, and like him was an experimental printmaker.

Through Linnell he met Samuel Palmer, who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the Shoreham Ancients. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on illustrations for the Book of Job, later admired by Ruskin, who compared Blake favourably to Rembrandt, and by Vaughan Williams, who based his ballet Job: A Masque for Dancing on a selection of the illustrations."]}, {"page": "Cornelis Cort", "response": ["The art collector George Cumberland wrote in 1827 thatCumberland, George, An Essay on the Utility of Collecting the Best Works of the Ancient (London, Payne and Foss, 1827) page 6 online at books.google.co.uk, accessed 12 July 2008 "]}, {"page": "Edward Bird", "response": ["At Bristol, Bird became the centre of an informal group which included other artists such as Edward Villiers Rippingille and Nathan Cooper Branwhite, and which developed into the Bristol School.

George Cumberland, another of the amateurs, had influential London connections. In 1820 when Francis Danby exhibited The Upas Tree of Java at the British Institution, Cumberland used his influence to promote its favourable reception. There is also evidence from their correspondence that Cumberland suggested subjects for Danby to paint. Cumberland was a close friend of William Blake, and it has been suggested that Blake's work may also have had some influence on Danby, for example in Danby's second exhibited painting, Disappointed Love, shown at the Royal Academy in 1821."]}, {"page": "William Orr (United Irishman)", "response": ["It was widely believed at the time that the authorities wished to make an example of Orr to act as a deterrent to potential recruits for the Society of United Irishmen.

Bentley suggests that Malkin met Blake in 1803, soon after Blake returned to London from his three years in Felpham.Bentley, 223 It is also possible that the two men were acquainted via the publisher Joseph Johnson for whom Blake had worked.  William Godwin reports meeting Malkin at dinner at Horne Tooke's in 1796 and 1797 and at Fuseli's Milton Gallery in 1800.Bentley, 223 fn.

He set up an artistic circle including Robert Fagan, Charles Grignion the Younger, Samuel Woodforde and George Cumberland. For his exhibition piece he modelled in plaster The Judgement of Jupiter (with over 20 figures and emulating history painting of the time, it was the largest 18th-century relief by a British artist) but the Academy argued with him over its size and it was not sent to London. A marble version however, was commissioned by Sir Richard Worsley in 1788, and is now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He produced a relief of Edward and Eleanor (drawn from a play by James Thomson) for Sir George Corbett and commanded a price of \u00a3700 for a statue of Apollo for Lord Berwick.
