McGuckin also states, \"We have no indication that the motive of castration for respectability was ever regarded as standard by a teacher of mixed-gender classes\". He adds that Origen's female students (whom Eusebius lists by name) would have been accompanied by attendants at all times, meaning that Origen would have had no good reason to think that anyone would suspect him of impropriety. Henry Chadwick argues that, while Eusebius's story may be true, it seems unlikely, given that Origen's exposition of Matthew 19:12 \"strongly deplored any literal interpretation of the words\". Instead, Chadwick suggests, \"Perhaps Eusebius was uncritically reporting malicious gossip retailed by Origen's enemies, of whom there were many.\" However, many noted historians, such as Peter Brown and William Placher, continue to find no reason to conclude that the story is false.William Placher, A History of Christian Theology: An Introduction, (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983), p. 62.

The tomb was found in a place used as a necropolis since the Late Roman Empire, so it is possible that the body belonged to a prominent person of the area. British historian Henry Chadwick hypothesized the tomb of Compostela actually hold the remains of Priscillian. Historian Roger Collins holds that the identification of the relics (at any rate nothing close to a full body) with Saint James is related to the translation of the remains found under a 6th-century church altar in M\u00e9rida, where various saint names are listed, Saint James among them. Other scholars, like Constantino Cabal, highlighted the fact that several Galician places, such as Pico Sacro, Pedra da Barca (Mux\u00eda) or San Andr\u00e9s de Teixido, were already draws for pagan pilgrimage in pre-Roman times. Pagan beliefs held these places as the End of the World and as entrances to the Celtic Otherworld.

The council had been called to deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid's concerns were not the sole focus of the council.

Some scholars state Peter was the first bishop of Rome. Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome. Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted, and that later writers retrospectively applied the term \"bishop of Rome\" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself. On this basis, Oscar Cullmann,Oscar Cullmann (1962), Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr (2 ed.), Westminster Press p. 234 Henry Chadwick,Henry Chadwick (1993), The Early Church, Penguin Books p. 18 and Bart D. Ehrman question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having \"roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church\".
