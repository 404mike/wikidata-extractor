But for every lapse into sackcloth-and-ashes anguish on The Hurting, the duo's debut album, there is a heady, danceable pop tune like 'Change'... Tears for Fears may be too concerned with their own petty traumas, but it is a testimony to their refined pop instincts that they manage to produce this much pleasure from the pain.\"", "Retrospective reviews regarded the album more highly. Reviewing the 1999 reissue for Q, Andrew Collins said, \"Despite its occasional bum note, The Hurting remains a landmark work... a highly emotional pop record, at its simplest\". Bruce Eder of AllMusic noted that the album's success was due to \"its makers' ability to package an unpleasant subject \u2013 the psychologically wretched family histories of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith \u2013 in an attractive and sellable musical format\" and said \"the work is sometimes uncomfortably personal, but musically compelling enough to bring it back across the decades\".", "For the 30th anniversary edition in 2013, Danny Eccleston of Mojo pondered, \"Has there ever been a more thoroughly miserable mainstream pop album than The Hurting?... Even when it is uptempo it is sombre, and at its most musically adventurous, in the cavernous minimalism of 'Ideas as Opiates' and gnarly dissonances of 'The Prisoner', it's almost unbearably bereft... But in essence, it was pop.\" Tom Byford of Record Collector summarised the album as \"a surfeit of complex ideas reflecting troubled upbringings married with immediate, infectious, hummable tunes\". John Bergstrom of PopMatters said that \"at times, the unflinching approach works to the album's detriment, as Orzabal's songwriting skirts clich\u00e9 and the obtuse, teenage poetry that some critics seized on at the time of The Hurtings release... But part of the brilliance of Hurting is that such histrionic moments are so seldom. Rather, time after time, as rendered by Orzabal and co-vocalist Curt Smith, the words connect at gut level and in sincere fashion.\" Calling the record \"simply one of the strongest, most fully-realized albums of the early-to-mid-1980s\", Bergstrom noted its influence on later acts such as Trent Reznor, Smashing Pumpkins and Arcade Fire, and concluded, \"The albums that prove to be special, influential, and groundbreaking in their own time, and then in subsequent eras as well, are far and few between. Thirty years on, there is little doubt where The Hurting stands.\"", "*\u2020 \u2013 The 1999 remastered version of the album incorrectly credits Curt Smith as co-writer and Mike Howlett as producer of \"Pale Shelter\" (Long Version).
