He also appeared as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), for which he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role; Elliott Marston in Quigley Down Under (1990); Jamie in Truly, Madly, Deeply (1991); P.L.

His breakthrough role was in the BBC television adaptation of The Barchester Chronicles (1982). He later starred in television films, playing the title character in Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny (1996), which won him a Golden Globe Award, an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and Alfred Blalock in Something the Lord Made (2004). Rickman died of pancreatic cancer on 14 January 2016 at age 69. His final film roles were as Lieutenant General Frank Benson in the thriller Eye in the Sky (2015), and reprising his role as the voice of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland (2010) in Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Batman Returns", "response": ["* Danny DeVito as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin: A psychopathic, deformed man abandoned by his parents when he was a baby.

A parody of and homage to science-fiction films and series, especially Star Trek and its fandom, the film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell.

Rickman had been interested in the part not so much for the sci-fi elements, but because of the humor. He said \"I love comedy almost more than anything. This really is one of the funniest scripts I've read,\" and that \"actors are probably the only professionals who send themselves up. We actually have a sense of humor about ourselves.\" While the original script made Dane a ceremonial knight, Rickman suggested the title would be too much for the character, and this was dropped, though he remained listed as \"Sir Alex Dane\" in the credits. Rickman also provided input into the prosthetic piece that Dane would use to play Lazarus, saying \"it was important for it to be good enough to convince the aliens who believe we're the real thing, but also cheesy enough to imagine that it was something he applied himself\". Rickman's sense of drama came into play during initial reads and script revisions. Rockwell said that Rickman \"was very instrumental in making sure the script hit the dramatic notes, and everything had a strong logic and reason behind it\". The scene where Dane, as Dr. Lazarus, gives a final, powerfully emotional speech to Quellek, played by Patrick Breen, utilized Rickman's sense of drama, according to Rockwell. Rickman was initially annoyed with Allen's excitement over his role, but eventually the whole cast bonded over the film. Dr. Lazarus' catchphrase, \"By Grabthar's Hammer\", was written as a temp line in Gordon's script; Gordon planned to replace \"Grabthar\" with something less comical, but the line stuck as the production crew started using it around their offices and had it printed on t-shirts.", "| Alan Rickman", "In January 2016, after the unexpected death of Alan Rickman from pancreatic cancer, Tim Allen commented in The Hollywood Reporter about the franchise's chance of a revival:"]}, {"page": "Ian McKellen", "response": ["In 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film Cold Comfort Farm starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry.

In particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused the already lonely boy to further \"shut himself in\". Rowling further described the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: \"Given his time over again [Snape] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.[...] [He] was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought [Lily] would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.\""]}, {"page": "Return of the Jedi", "response": ["Alan Rickman auditioned for the role of Moff Jerjerrod but lost the role to Michael Pennington."]}, {"page": "2016", "response": ["** Alan Rickman, English actor and director (b. 1946)"]}, {"page": "Kate Winslet", "response": ["The novelty of playing a villainous part drew Winslet to Jeanine Matthews in the science fiction film Divergent (2014).
