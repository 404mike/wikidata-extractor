After turning professional in 1996, he made his senior debut in 1998 and became a semi regular first team player during the 1998\u201399 season, when the club won the Treble. After a year-long hiatus due to injury, Brown became a regular fixture in the first team from 2000 onwards. Over the next eight years, he won numerous honours, including four more Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a League Cup and another Champions League. Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has stated that Brown is \"without question the best natural defender this club has had for years\". After 15 years with Manchester United, Brown was allowed to leave for Sunderland.\nBrown earned his first England cap in 1999 and was selected to play at the 2002 World Cup. He played in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers but England failed to progress to the final tournament. He scored his first international goal in 2008 against the Czech Republic. Brown announced his retirement from international football on 8 August 2010, just a day after being recalled to the England squad by Fabio Capello.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 13", "response": ["*1979 \u2013 Wes Brown, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)", "response": ["In the second leg of Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford, knocking the English team out of the competition.

Reflecting on the ovation given to him from the oppositions' fans, Ronaldo stated that \"it remains a very beautiful, very special moment\". Manchester United defender Wes Brown commmented, \"He was just unstoppable. A young Ronaldo [before a series of injuries] would have been even more dangerous, but it shows how good a player he was. Whenever he wanted to turn it on he could, on any stage, in any stadium\".
