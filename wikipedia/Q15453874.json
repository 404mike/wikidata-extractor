She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium.Ferris (1989), p. 151 Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End.Paul Ferris, \"Thomas, Caitlin (1913\u20131994)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (subscription only) Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met.FitzGibbon (1965), p. 205 Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting.Ferris (1989), pp. 152\u2013153 They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937.Ferris (1989), p. 161 In early 1938, they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.Ferris (1989), p. 164 Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.Ferris (1989), p. 175", "In September that year, the Thomas family moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), where they rented Majoda, a wood and asbestos bungalow on the cliffs overlooking Cardigan Bay. It was here that Thomas wrote the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later work, Under Milk Wood.Ferris (1989), p. 213 Of the poetry written at this time, of note is \"Fern Hill\", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaencwm in mid-1945.Ferris (1989), p. 214John Brinnin in his 1956 book, Dylan Thomas in America (p. 104) states that on a visit to Laugharne in 1951 he was shown \"more than two hundred separate and distinct versions of the poem (Fern Hill)\" by Thomas. His nine months in New Quay, said first biographer, Constantine FitzGibbon, were \"a second flowering, a period of fertility that recalls the earliest days\u2026[with a] great outpouring of poems\", as well as a good deal of other material.FitzGibbon (1965) p266  His second biographer, Paul Ferris, concurred: \"On the grounds of output, the bungalow deserves a plaque of its own.\"Ferris (1999) p4. The Dylan Thomas scholar, Walford Davies, has noted that New Quay \"was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing Under Milk Wood.\"Maud, R. 1995 pxvii", "On returning to Britain, Thomas began work on two further poems, \"In the white giant's thigh\", which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950, and the incomplete \"In country heaven\".Ferris (1989), pp. 279\u2013280 In October, Thomas sent a draft of the first 39 pages of 'The Town That Was Mad' to the BBC.Ferris, P. (2000) Collected Letters, p860 The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'.Ferris (1989), p. 280 Despite Cleverdon's urgings, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary, 'Persian Oil'.Ferris (1989), pp. 281\u2013282 Early that year, Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris, describes as \"unusually blunt\"; the ribald \"Lament\" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father \"Do not go gentle into that good night\".Ferris (1989), pp. 282\u2013283", "*Ferris, Paul (ed) (2017), Dylan Thomas: The Collected Letters, 2 vols.
