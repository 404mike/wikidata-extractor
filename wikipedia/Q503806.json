He is the developer of soft systems methodology (SSM): a methodology based on a way of systems thinking systems practice. Systems practice is the idea that real-world problems could be improved with solutions that were both systematically desirable and culturally feasible. In an important way his work preceded data science and change management disciplines in the next century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Systems theory", "response": ["Others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original systems theorists. For example, Ilya Prigogine, of the Center for Complex Quantum Systems at the University of Texas, has studied emergent properties, suggesting that they offer analogues for living systems. The distinction of autopoiesis as made by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela represent further developments in this field.

One way of conceiving of these is in three groups: fields that have developed systems ideas primarily through theory; those that have done so primarily through practical engagements with problem situations; and those that have applied systems ideas in the context of other disciplines.Peter Checkland. 1981.

These readinesses are organized into an 'appreciative system' which creates for all of us, individually and socially, our appreciated world....The appreciative settings condition new experience but are modified by the new experience. Such circular relations Vickers takes to be the common facts of social life, but we fail to see this clearly, he argues, because of the concentration in our science-based culture on linear causal chains and on the notion of goal-seeking. Vickers suggests replacing the goal-setting and goal-seeking with feedback models in which personal, institutional or cultural activity consists in maintaining desired relationships and eluding undesired ones. The process is a cyclical one which operates like this: Our previous experiences have created for us certain 'standards' or 'norms', usually 'tacit' (and also, at a more general level, 'values', more general concepts of what is humanly good and bad); the standards, norms and/or values lead to readiness to notice only certain features of our situations, they determine what 'facts' are relevant; the facts noticed are evaluated against the norms, a process which leads to our taking regulatory action and modifies the norms or standards, so that future experiences will be evaluated differently.Peter Checkland \"Systems Thinking Systems Practice\" (p. 262)", "Geoffrey Vickers continued corresponding with Peter Checkland in the years before Vickers' death and discussed the relationship between systems ideas and real-world experience. From those discussions Checkland created the model of the appreciative process, that may be used as a basis for making sense of the world we live in. Checkland (2004) worked on numerous examples to demonstrate the way in which the model may be applied in very different situations.Peter Checkland (2004), \"Webs of significance: the work of Geoffrey Vickers\" in: Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Vol 22, Is 4, pp. 291-298."]}, {"page": "List of systems engineers", "response": ["* Peter Checkland (born 1930), British management scientist and emeritus professor of Systems at Lancaster University; developer of soft systems methodology (SSM), a methodology based on a way of systems thinking"]}, {"page": "John Naughton", "response": ["Naughton joined the Open University as a lecturer in Systems in 1972.

It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by man. Important distinctions have also been madeCheckland, 1997; Flood, 1999. between hard systems \u2013 technical in nature and amenable to methods such as systems engineering, operations research, and quantitative systems analysis \u2013 and soft systems that involve people and organisations, commonly associated with concepts developed by Peter Checkland and Brian Wilson through Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) involving methods such as action research and emphasis of participatory designs.
