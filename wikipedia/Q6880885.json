His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez", "response": ["Davies and Caldwell began the 2012\u201313 season as first choice until an ankle injury sustained by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress.

However he missed three months of the start of the 2019\u201320 season with a broken foot. On 9 March, Mark Bonner replaced Calderwood as manager, and just two days later a loan deal was arranged for Jones with National League club Solihull Moors. Moors manager James Shan said that \"We have had to tap into the loan market to provide cover for Alex Gudger and Mitch Hancox who both picked up knocks.\" However he was unable to feature for the Moors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, and on 29 April Cambridge announced that Jones would be one of nine players to be released by the club at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Matt Green (footballer)", "response": ["After a trial with Championship club Birmingham City in May 2013, Green signed a two-year contract with the club on 3 July 2013.
