In 1989 he became Swedish team champion with the now defunct Stockholm U team. The next year, he won the Swedish Championship, a title he's won six times since, including three times in a row from 1997 to 1999. That year, he also won a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in Lviv. In 1991, he made his debut at the World Championship in Gothenburg, and surprised many by winning silver behind diminutive Dane Jan O. Pedersen. Rickardsson was lucky to actually make the 1991 World Final after having missed qualifying when he finished 10th in the Nordic Final in Denmark, but got his chance when as first reserve he replaced injured English rider Andy Smith for the World Semi-final in Germany and ended up finishing a strong 5th to qualify for the Final."]}, {"page": "Andrew Smith", "response": ["*Andy Smith (American football) (1883\u20131926), American college football coach", "*Andy Smith (darts player) (born 1967), darts player who competes in Professional Darts Corporation events", "*Andy Smith (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131968), English footballer", "*Andy Smith (footballer, born 1968), Scottish footballer (Airdrie, Dunfermline)", "*Andy Smith (footballer, born 1980), Northern Ireland international footballer", "*Andy Smith (footballer, born 2001), English footballer", "*Andy Smith (hurler) (born 1983), Irish hurler", "*Andy Smith (rugby league) (born 1984), English rugby league player", "*Andy Smith (speedway rider) (born 1966), former Speedway Grand Prix rider", "*Andy Smith (entrepreneur) (born 1968), American author and entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "2002 Speedway Grand Prix", "response": ["|Andy Smith "]}, {"page": "List of Speedway Grand Prix riders", "response": ["*  Andy Smith"]}, {"page": "Oxford Cheetahs", "response": ["| 2003 || Andy Smith || Charlie Gjedde || Craig Boyce || Darren Andrews|| Emil Kramer ||  Greg Hancock  || Henning Bager || Jamie Smith", "| ||Chris Schramm ||Andy Smith || Lubo\u0161 Tom\u00ed\u010dek Jr. "]}, {"page": "British Speedway Championship", "response": ["| |Andy Smith", "| |Andy Smith", "| |Andy Smith", "| |Andy Smith", "| ||align=left| Andy Smith || 4"]}, {"page": "British Speedway Under 21 Championship", "response": ["| |Andy Smith", "| |Andy Smith"]}, {"page": "1999 Speedway World Team Cup", "response": ["|valign=top| 29+26.Chris Louis (3,1,3,3,1,1) - 127.Carl Stonehewer (1,-,e,-,0,0) - 18.Joe Screen (1,0,0,0,-,3) 4+29.Mark Loram (2,3,2/0,1,2,2) - 1210.Andy Smith (-,0,-,-,0,-) - 0"]}, {"page": "2008 Speedway Ekstraliga", "response": ["|align=left|   Andy Smith ||42 ||2.000 (1)"]}, {"page": "1994 Mieczys\u0142aw Po\u0142ukard Criterium of Polish Speedway Leagues Aces", "response": ["#  Andy Smith - Polonia-Jutrzenka Bydgoszcz"]}, {"page": "1993 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Cradley Heath || Gary Havelock || Andy Smith || Andy Grahame ", "|Coventry ||| Andy Smith ||| Joe Screen ||| Gary Havelock", "|1 ||align=left| Andy Smith ||14", "|King's Lynn || Leigh Adams || Andy Smith || Martin Dugard ", "|2 ||align=left| Andy Smith ||13", "|10 ||align=left| Andy Smith ||6+3", "|8 ||align=left| Andy Smith ||8+3"]}, {"page": "1994 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Coventry ||| Andy Smith ||| Joe Screen ||| Steve Schofield"]}, {"page": "2004 Mieczys\u0142aw Po\u0142ukard Criterium of Polish Speedway Leagues Aces", "response": ["# Andy SmithSmith has two citizen: British and Polish. - Polonia Bydgoszcz"]}, {"page": "1992 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|3 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 11", "|10 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 7", "|5 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 10", "|11 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 7"]}, {"page": "1991 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|7 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 8 ", "|10 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 7", "|4 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 11", "* First reserve Tony Rickardsson replaced injured qualifier Andy Smith"]}, {"page": "1989 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Claremont Speedway || Glenn Doyle || Andy Smith || Glyn Taylor ", "|9 ||align=left|  Andy Smith ||7 || (2,0,1,2,2)", "|6 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 9", "|9 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 8", "|9 ||align=left| Andy Smith || 6", "|7 ||align=left| Andy Smith || (1,2,2,2,3) ||10"]}, {"page": "1988 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|8 ||align=left| Andy Smith ||1,3,1,1,2|| 8"]}]}}
