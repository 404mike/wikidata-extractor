She wrote a pioneering work on Gothic literature: The Tale of Terror (1921).  This work described the fascination with supernatural fiction in English literature from the publication of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto in 1764 to Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer in 1820 on to modern times.  She included works from Europe as well as America, including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Supernatural Horror in Literature", "response": ["Lovecraft's essay ranges widely, but he first examines the beginnings of weird fiction in the early gothic novel. As a guide for what to read in the early gothic he relied partly on Edith Birkhead's 1921 historical survey The Tale of Terror, and he was also able to draw on the expertise of the great many experts and collectors in his circle. The bulk of the essay was written in New York City giving Lovecraft easy access to the resources of the city's great public libraries and also to the collections of his friends, and thus he was able to read widely and obtain obscure and rare works.  His survey then proceeds to outline the development of the supernatural and the weird in the work of major writers such as Ambrose Bierce, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Edgar Allan Poe. Lovecraft names as the four \"modern masters\" of horror: Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany,  M. R. James, and Arthur Machen.  In addition to these masters, Lovecraft attempts to make the essay an encompassing survey, and thus he mentions or notes many others in passing."]}, {"page": "Birkhead", "response": ["*Edith Birkhead, lecturer in English Literature at the University of Bristol and a Noble Fellow at the University of Liverpool"]}, {"page": "The Iron Shroud", "response": ["Edith Birkhead mentions that the \"Iron Shroud\" belongs in a type of horror story which is all the more striking because it is based on natural effects and not on the supernatural.
