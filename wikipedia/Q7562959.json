After writing the music, the team recruited British singer-songwriter Sophie Barker, who provided additional writing. Zero 7 then met Australian singer Sia, whose manager recommended her to the duo, and she became the track's fourth writer. The song, a downtempo ballad, is about two separated romantics who wish to be with each other again, with one of the partners so desperate to interact with the other that she resorts to watching pornography in a hotel room. Sia and Barker contribute to the vocal performances, with Sia singing the verses and choruses while Barker duets with Sia during the choruses. The song was included on Zero 7's debut studio album, Simple Things, which was released on 23 April 2001.", "One of Zero 7's members, Henry Binns, explained to Helen Brown of British newspaper The Independent that after he and Zero 7 partner Sam Hardaker had composed the music for their debut studio album, Simple Things, they began to search for singers, one of whom was \"Destiny\" vocalist and writer Sophie Barker. She had been performing music around London during the album's creation, and after Zero 7 attended one her shows, they asked her to be a vocalist on Simple Things, to which she agreed. Afterwards, most of the album's material was complete, but Zero 7 believed that \"Destiny\", then an instrumental, was missing a certain quality. At the time, Hardaker played association football with Sia's manager, and although Hardaker initially reacted reluctantly to the manager's proposition to feature her on the track, he soon discovered that Sia was the vocalist for whom they had been searching. With her help, they penned the lyrics for two songs in one afternoon: \"Distractions\" and \"Destiny\". According to Binns, he was amazed that Sia had managed to work with so little complication. He stated, \"She worked so fast \u2013 was so completely in the moment. If you didn't catch her vocal on the first take you worried it might never happen.\" In a 2020 interview with music magazine The Big Takeover, Binns recalled that having Sia as a vocalist \"spoiled\" him and Hardaker."]}, {"page": "Lullaby (Sophie Barker album)", "response": ["Lullaby is a popular children's album released by \"The Rainbow Collections\" (singer Sophie Barker and musician KK) on 14 June 2005.
