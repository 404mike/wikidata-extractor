(1996). Wage Inequality in the UK. Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 12(1), pp. 47-64. Among else, Machin (with Lorraine Dearden and Howard Reed) with finds that intergenerational mobility is low in Britain as upward mobility from the bottom of the wage distribution fails to compensate for the rigidity of downward mobility from its top.Lorraine, D., Machin, S., Reed, H. (1997). Intergenerational Mobility in Britain. Economic Journal, 107(440), pp. 47-66. With regard to wage inequality, Machin, Costas Meghir and Amanda Gosling argue that the growth in British wage inequality in 1978-95 is mainly due to increases in the differences between returns to education and the persistently slow growth of entry level wages.Gosling, A., Machin, S., Meghir, C. (2000). The Changing Distribution of Male Wages in the U.K. Review of Economic Studies, 67(4), pp. 635-666. Related to his work on the role of wage-education differentials, Machin has also conducted research on skill-biased technological change. In particular, he finds (with John van Reenen) that the relative demand for skilled workers increased throughout the 1970s and 1980s all across the OECD (and not only in the U.S.) as technical change required workers to upgrade their skillsMachin, Van Reenen, J. (1998). Technology and Changes in Skill Structure: Evidence from Seven OECD Countries. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 113(4), pp. 1215-1244. and shows (with Eli Berman and John Bound) that the larger the skill-biased technological change is, the larger its potential to depress the relative wages of less-skilled workers, thus resulting in higher wage inequality.Bekman, E., Bound, J., Machin, S.
