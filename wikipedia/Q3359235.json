In 1846, Henry Poole, later credited as the creator of the dinner jacket, opened an entrance to Savile Row from his tailoring premises in Old Burlington Street. Founded in 1849 by Henry Huntsman, H. Huntsman & Sons moved to No. 11 Savile Row with the ending of the war in 1919.Richard Anderson, Bespoke: Savile Row Ripped and Smoothed, (Simon & Schuster, 2009) p.106 During the First World War, Huntsman's was a tailor to the military, producing dress uniforms for British officers throughout the conflict. In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of traditional Savile Row tailoring; a modernisation that continued in the 1990s with the \"New Bespoke Movement\", involving the designers Richard James, Ozwald Boateng, and Timothy Everest. The term \"bespoke\" as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row, and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand.", "In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of the traditional tailors; a modernisation which continued in the 1990s with the \"New Bespoke Movement\", involving the designers Richard James, Ozwald Boateng, and Timothy Everest. With increasing rents and criticisms from Giorgio Armani of falling behind the times, the number of tailors in Savile Row had declined to 19 in 2006, from approximately 40 in the 1950s. However, tailoring businesses have increased since 2006; as of October 2014, a local online directory listed 44 tailoring and clothing businesses on and around Savile Row. Some tailors had expressed concern in 2005 that an increase in commercial development in the area could lead to the death of the business locally, as tailors, many of whom traditionally manufacture their suits in their premises, in basement studios, could be priced out of the local property market.  The Savile Row Bespoke Association was founded in 2004 to protect and develop bespoke tailoring as practised in Savile Row and the surrounding streets. The member tailors are typically required to put at least 50 hours of hand labour into each two-piece suit. The Association, along with the owners, the Pollen Estate, is working in partnership with Westminster Council to protect the street's tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area).", "Modernisation had slowed by the early 1990s; Savile Row tailors were \"struggling to find relevance with an audience that had grown increasingly disassociated\". Three tailors, Ozwald Boateng, Timothy Everest (an apprentice of Nutter's), and Richard James, then became known for revitalising the bespoke style for the modern market -  having each broken away independently from the Savile Row mould. Public relations professional Alison Hargreaves coined the term \"New Bespoke Movement\" to describe collectively the work of this \"new generation\" of tailors. Interest reached a peak in 1997 when the three were featured together in Vanity Fair. The newcomers altered their shop fronts and used marketing and publicity to their advantage; challenging the traditional Savile Row styling, they brought twists and \"a fine sense of colour to bespoke suits.\" They were seen to \"push the envelope of modern suit making and bespoke active wear, creating more contemporary silhouettes with bolder fabrics,\" and set out to attract celebrity clients, sell their clothing via supermarket chains, and attract wider national and international custom, raising the profile of their new tailoring style.
