An own goal from Dutch defender Stefan Stam gave Argyle the lead, but the Greens failed to extend their lead after a missed penalty from Simon Walton and the inevitable happened when Hereford's Tom Barkhuizen equalised in the second half. An injury to goalkeeper Jake Cole saw Romain Larrieu start and saw Ollie Chenoweth recalled from his loan at Truro City to sit on the bench in a 1\u20130 win at home to Aldershot Town; Alex MacDonald the goalscorer. A visit to historical rivals Swindon Town was next, and despite losing 1\u20130 through an 84th minute Alan Connell goal, results elsewhere meant that Argyle were nearly safe from relegation, with seven points separating them from the bottom two and with three games left to play."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["|Tom Barkhuizen", "|\"Blackpool's Tom Barkhuizen & Ash Eastham join Fleetwood on loan\", BBC Sport, 29 August 2012"]}, {"page": "Thomas Barkhuizen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Barkhuizen"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["Bolton will enter the FA Cup at the Third Round stage with the other Championship clubs, as well as those from the Premier League. On 8 December, Bolton were drawn to play Blackpool at the Reebok Stadium, with the match played on 4 January 2014. David N'Gog scored his second goal in as many games to open the scoring before Tom Barkhuizen scored just before half-time to level matters. The goal was initially ruled out for offside as a Blackpool player had impeded Andy Lonergan's view when in an offside position, but referee Simon Hooper overruled his assistant. Five minutes after the restart, however, N'Gog set up Jermaine Beckford to score his 17th goal in 20 FA Cup games, with the goal also meaning that he had scored in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup for the fifth season running, all for different clubs. The following day, Bolton were drawn against Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r's Cardiff City in the next round, again at home. Substitute Fraizer Campbell scored just after half-time for the Bluebirds to send Bolton out of the FA Cup; who exited at the fourth round for the second consecutive year."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["Reading suffered their first defeat of the season away to Blackpool, losing 1\u20130 after a late Tom Barkhuizen strike.
