Entering the final race with a triad of top-five marks over the past ten legs, Szoty\u0144ska steered her way to touch the line in the ninth position with 109 net points. Furthermore, Szoty\u0144ska's overall score spared her from the back of the fleet by a slim three-point edge over Great Britain's Penny Clark."]}]}}
