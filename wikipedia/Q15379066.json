He died in Abingdon-on-Thames.Harding was born at Woolston, Hampshire near Southampton in 1916 and educated at Reading School in Berkshire. He played for Berkshire County Cricket Club between 1934 and 1936, including making 16 appearances in the Minor Counties Championship and moved to play professionally at Kent in the 1937 season. In his first competitive match for Kent, a Second XI fixture against Wiltshire, he took 18 wickets, nine in each Wiltshire innings, a feat Wisden describes as \"extraordinary\" and \"regarded as unique in county cricket\".He made his first-class debut for the county in August 1937 against Gloucestershire at Dover, going on to make 83 first-class appearances for Kent, playing regularly after his first season. During World War II Harding played some club cricket in the Lancashire League for Rishton Cricket Club in 1941 and appeared for an Anti-Aircraft Command side and an England XI in 1943. He made three appearances for Berkshire in matches during 1945 and played for an Under 33s side in one of the eleven first-class matches possible in England after the end of the war before rejoining Kent in 1946.Harding was considered to be a key member of Kent's bowling attack either side of the war. He took 69 wickets in 1939 and 68 in 1947 and was perhaps the fastest Kent bowler since Bill Bradley who had bowled at the turn of the century. He died in the 1947 polio epidemic which swept the United Kingdom after less than a week in hospital at Abingdon-on-Thames. He was 31.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Kent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership. The team was again captained by Bryan Valentine and featured England stars Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright, though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. Les Ames, Les Todd and Arthur Fagg all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander Peter Hearn was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner Ray Dovey, all-rounder Jack Davies and the two pacemen Fred Ridgway and Norman Harding. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary, p. 783. Other players included Geoffrey Anson, Brian Edrich, the veteran Hopper Levett in his final season, Tony Mallett, future captain Bill Murray-Wood and Tony Pawson. A curious case was pace bowler Jack Martin, who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the Trent Bridge Test.Playfair, pp. 89\u201390."]}, {"page": "Leslie Todd", "response": ["Todd became a more regular bowler starting with the 1935 season, often sharing the new ball with either Alan Watt or Norman Harding. Having reverted to his more natural medium-paced bowling style, which offered pronounced in-swing, Todd took over 80 wickets in each of the next five seasons. 1936 saw Todd perform the double; scoring 1,320 runs and taking 103 wickets, while his 1,323 runs and 91 wickets in 1937 saw him invited to play in the end-of-season Test trial match.Carlaw, p. 54."]}, {"page": "Norman Harding", "response": ["Norman Harding (25 June 1929 \u2013 9 December 2013) was an English trade unionist and tenants' leader who worked for the Workers Revolutionary Party whilst living in London.
