He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by Chelsea's Jimmy Thompson, and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (named after manager Ted Drake in response to Manchester United's \"Busby Babes\"). He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach Dick Foss. Greaves scored in the 1958 FA Youth Cup final, but Chelsea lost the two-legged tie 7\u20136 on aggregate after Wolverhampton Wanderers turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.
