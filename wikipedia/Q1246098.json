Whistler's brother-in-law Francis Haden, a physician who was also an artist, spurred his interest in art and photography. Haden took Whistler to visit collectors and to lectures, and gave him a watercolour set with instruction. Whistler already was imagining an art career. He began to collect books on art and he studied other artists' techniques. When his portrait was painted by Sir William Boxall in 1848, the young Whistler exclaimed that the portrait was \"very much like me and a very fine picture. Mr. Boxall is a beautiful colourist... It is a beautiful creamy surface, and looks so rich.\" In his blossoming enthusiasm for art, at fifteen, he informed his father by letter of his future direction, \"I hope, dear father, you will not object to my choice.\" His father, however, died from cholera at the age of 49, and the Whistler family moved back to his mother's home town of Pomfret, Connecticut. His art plans remained vague and his future uncertain. The family lived frugally and managed to get by on a limited income. His cousin reported that Whistler at that time was \"slight, with a pensive, delicate face, shaded by soft brown curls... he had a somewhat foreign appearance and manner, which, aided by natural abilities, made him very charming, even at that age.\"", "The public reacted negatively to the painting, mostly because of its anti-Victorian simplicity during a time in England when sentimentality and flamboyant decoration were in vogue. Critics thought the painting a failed \"experiment\" rather than art. The Royal Academy rejected it, but then grudgingly accepted it after lobbying by Sir William Boxall\u2014but they hung it in an unfavorable location at their exhibition."]}, {"page": "National Gallery", "response": ["The new director's taste was for the Northern and Early Italian Renaissance masters or \"primitives\", who had been neglected by the Gallery's acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs.
