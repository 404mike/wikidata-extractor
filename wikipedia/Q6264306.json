He transferred to the infantry in 1954. He served with the Parachute Regiment in the Suez Canal Zone, Cyprus and Borneo.\nOn 27 April 1965, Williams's company base at Plaman Mapu, on the border between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and Indonesia, came under heavy attack by the Indonesian infantry. Williams was awarded the DCM for gallantry during what would be known as the Battle of Plaman Mapu, where he served as a Company Sergeant Major with the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment. An extract from his citation for the DCM reads: \"The successful defence of the position against great odds was largely due to his courage, his example and leadership and to his own direct intervention in the battle at every crisis and at every point of maximum danger.\"\nHe underwent many operations as a result of injuries sustained during the battle. He later became Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment. He was commissioned in 1971.

By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia\u2013Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plaman Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams's machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base."]}, {"page": "April 1965", "response": ["*The Indonesia\u2013Malaysia Confrontation began on the island of Borneo, where Malaysia and Indonesia had territory, as the Indonesian Army crossed the border into the Malaysian state of Sarawak and attacked the British Army Parachute Regiment, based at the border village of Plaman Mapu.Emile Simpson, War From the Ground Up: Twenty-First Century Combat as Politics (Oxford University Press, 2012)  Company Sergeant Major John Williams of the 2nd Battalion would win the DCM for gallantry for his role in what was known as the Battle of Plaman Mapu.

There the British had established a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond serving a lookout point for the detection of Indonesian raiders crossing the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, being equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had little experience with jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle."]}]}}
