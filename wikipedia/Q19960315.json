She initially appears in a promotional webisode for Series 2, in which she converses with Ivan and Daisy in a Singapore restaurant prior to her departure to join the other old ones in Bolivia. Hetty was originally responsible for recruiting Herrick as a vampire, and expresses disappointment that he was killed in such an \"undignified\" manner. This is expanded on in a scripted but never filmed webisode for Series 3 set in 1890, in which Herrick (then a crooked lawyer, and unaware of Hetty's nature) attempts to sell her to a brothel as a child prostitute following the death of her father: instead she attacks and feeds on him, and recruits him into the vampire species."]}, {"page": "Me and Mrs Jones (TV series)", "response": ["* Madeleine Harris \u2013 Poppy - Tom's daughter and one of Charlotte and Jess's classmates."]}, {"page": "Being Human (British series 5)", "response": ["* Madeleine Harris as Hettie"]}, {"page": "Man Down (TV series)", "response": ["* Madeleine Harris as Karen (series 1\u20133)"]}, {"page": "Paddington (film)", "response": ["* Madeleine Harris as Judy Brown"]}, {"page": "Paddington 2", "response": ["* Madeleine Harris as Judy Brown, Mary and Henry's daughter and Jonathan's sister", "In April 2015, David Heyman, the producer of Paddington (2014), confirmed that a sequel was in development.
