It was produced by Bj\u00f6rk and Nellee Hooper. It was Bj\u00f6rk's first recording following the dissolution of her previous band, the Sugarcubes. The album departed from the rock style of her previous work and drew from an eclectic variety of styles, including electronic pop, house music, jazz and trip hop.", "Bj\u00f6rk intended to have several producers work on the album. She planned to have the album produced with Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had produced albums by Soul II Soul and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor which made Bj\u00f6rk skeptical about working with him, stating: \"I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then I met him, got to know him, [and] got to hear about his fabulous ideas.\" Bj\u00f6rk and Hooper's recording ideas were similar, which led to her decision to end production with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Bj\u00f6rk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries, who gave Debut a modern style with keyboards and synthesizers. He produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Bj\u00f6rk co-produced \"Like Someone in Love\" with Hooper and produced \"The Anchor Song\" alone. Bj\u00f6rk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.", "\"Like Someone in Love\" is followed by the techno-tinged \"Big Time Sensuality\" in an \"intentionally startling\" leap. An \"anthem to emotional bravery,\" it contains lyrics described as \"simple but passionate\", concerning Bj\u00f6rk's relationship with her co-producer Nellee Hooper. The songs \"The Anchor Song\", \"One Day\", and \"Aeroplane\" draw on what Bj\u00f6rk refers to as her more \"academic, clever side\". \"One Day\" also presents a sudden shift of mood, featuring a \"gently pulsing bass\" that builds into an \"itchily impassioned, housey pop euphoria.\" \"Aeroplane\" is one of Debuts most musically complicated pieces with off-kilter arrangement from Oliver Lake; its backdrop is inspired by exotica music. This song is also about Thrupp, written when he was living in the United Kingdom and Bj\u00f6rk still lived in Iceland. \"Come to Me\" features a \"hazy musical backdrop of raindrop synths, padded drums and sweeping strings\"; lyrically, it explores a \"sensually intense need to nurture.\" \"Violently Happy\" is the most hardcore techno track on the album. In the song, over \"brisk house beats\" Bj\u00f6rk sings in a stammering fashion, as she \"struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin.\" As a gesture to inexpressible feelings, the song samples one syllable and \"[turns] it into a stuttering vocal tic.\" The closing track \"The Anchor Song\" is the only one in the album solely produced by Bj\u00f6rk. One of the three songs to appear on her first demo cassette of 1990, it features Oliver Lake playing the saxophone, in an arrangement that replicated the \"ebb and tide of an ocean's peaking tops, an image reinforced by Bj\u00f6rk's fiercely patriotic lyrics.\"", "American critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"neither\" rating, indicating an album that \"may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two.

Bj\u00f6rk had originally intended to stay in M\u00e1laga only briefly, but later decided to record the entirety of Homogenic there. Bj\u00f6rk made a final trip out of the country before staying in Spain. As she had done since moving to London, Bj\u00f6rk returned to Iceland for Christmas. While there, she wrote more new songs for Homogenic, including \"J\u00f3ga\". Before returning to Spain to record, Bj\u00f6rk was sidetracked by a two-week worldwide press tour for the promotion of her remix album Telegram, which had just been released. After returning to the studio in Spain in late January, Bj\u00f6rk decided to end work with producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, as she felt they had \"stopped surprising each other\". Bj\u00f6rk had intended to produce the album alone, but sought collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Bj\u00f6rk on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed to the production of Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned.

Bj\u00f6rk produced Post herself with co-producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. She wrote most of the songs after moving to London, and intended the album to convey the city's pace, urban culture, and underground club culture.", "Bj\u00f6rk released her previous studio album Debut in 1993, on One Little Indian Records.

Bj\u00f6rk's adoption of \"the contemporary musical environment of London\" also included the burgeoning trip hop scene of bands like Portishead and Massive Attack. Nellee Hooper, who produced the album, had been a member of Bristol's Wild Bunch collective, a group that took from acid jazz, funk and hip hop, and catalysed the appearance of trip hop.", "The production of Debut was \"long and laborious\", as it required Bj\u00f6rk to realise her compositional ideas from the past ten years in a creatively autonomous fashion. After Debut's release, she was free to concentrate on her present life for new musical clues for her following album. Once again, she contacted Nellee Hooper to produce the album. He refused initially, encouraging her to produce the album herself, but agreed when she insisted. However, Bj\u00f6rk agreed to co-produce along with other enlisted producers; \"to make it stay fresh, she had to think about other people being involved\". With Hooper's confirmation, Bj\u00f6rk commenced work on the album in late 1994 at the Compass Point Studios in Nassau. The picturesque locale inspired Bj\u00f6rk to meld the recording process with the exotic natural environment. Biographer Mark Pytlik writes: \"The tales surrounding these recording sessions are appropriately evocative\". For example, Rolling Stone wrote that for her vocals: \"Bj\u00f6rk extended her mic cord to a beach so she could sing to the sea\". Additionally, the first version of \"Cover Me\" was recorded entirely from a nearby cave.", "\"Possibly Maybe\" is an ambient track that a fuses trip hop and chill-out music. Bj\u00f6rk has said that it was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: \"That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope\".

With the track, De Vries \"create[ed] a vinyl-crackling ambience, full of glissando strings and leaden, muted bass. The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Bj\u00f6rk initially strived for an \"ambient country\" sound inspired by Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\".  \"I Miss You\" was described in 1997 as an \"amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing\". A house music number, its \"horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [its] lyrics\". Bj\u00f6rk wrote \"Cover Me\", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he agreed to participate in the making of Post. She has said: \"I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also  thing from me to him\". The album ends with the experimental \"Headphones\", an ambient track. Featuring \"just-for-headphones studio tricks\", it has been described as \"a chiming, somnolent dip into Bj\u00f6rk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state\". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Bj\u00f6rk. She also stated: \"But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing\".", "Joy Press, who reviewed the album for The New York Times, praised the album for not being a \"play-safe sequel\" to Debut, pointing out that Bj\u00f6rk, \"[had] followed her most wonderfully wayward impulses\". Los Angeles Times critic Richard Cromelin felt that Post was \"an often heady mix of trendiness and nostalgia\" that was capable of transcending Bj\u00f6rk's self-consciousness. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune found the album's backing tracks to be \"even more varied and unusual\" than on Debut, describing Bj\u00f6rk as \"an extra-terrestrial voice rummaging around in a sonic toybox\". Spins Barry Walters felt the album was an improvement over its predecessor, stating its songs were \"stronger, more developed, and less reliant on Bj\u00f6rk's wide-eyed delivery\".

Virgo, trained in classical piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had been working as a session musician since the early 1990s as part of the production team of Nellee Hooper, which led to credits on a remix of Massive Attack's \"Unfinished Sympathy\" (considered one of the landmark songs of trip hop's \"Bristol sound\") and Bj\u00f6rk's 1993 album Debut. De Mar\u00e9 comes from a family with several generations of history in entertainment; her father was Tony Meehan, drummer for the Shadows, her grandfather was one of the Gongmen featured in the opening logo sequences in Rank Organisation films, and her grandmother was a dancer who worked with Shirley Bassey. She had been working as a session singer for hip hop and R&B musicians, as well as writing and touring, though much of this material consisted of underground and white label releases.
