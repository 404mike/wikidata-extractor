Besides attending to an extensive printing and new-book trade, the younger Allen took an active part in local affairs, and brought together the remarkable collection of antiquities, books, manuscripts, maps, and prints relating to Herefordshire, described in his Bibliotheca. A history of the county, with which he had made some progress, has never been published. He retired to London about six or seven years before his death, which occurred in 1831.His printed works are:\nA Translation of the Charter granted to the City of Hereford by King William III, 14 June 1697 [by J. A.], 1820\nBibliotheca Herefordiensis, or a descriptive catalogue of books, pamphlets, maps, prints, &c., relating to the county of Hereford, 1821. Only twenty-five copies printed on writing-paper and one on vellum, for private distribution, were issued of this work.
