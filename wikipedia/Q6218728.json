Besides attending to an extensive printing and new-book trade, the younger Allen took an active part in local affairs, and brought together the remarkable collection of antiquities, books, manuscripts, maps, and prints relating to Herefordshire, described in his Bibliotheca. A history of the county, with which he had made some progress, has never been published. He retired to London about six or seven years before his death, which occurred in 1831.His printed works are:\nA Translation of the Charter granted to the City of Hereford by King William III, 14 June 1697 [by J. A.], 1820\nBibliotheca Herefordiensis, or a descriptive catalogue of books, pamphlets, maps, prints, &c., relating to the county of Hereford, 1821. Only twenty-five copies printed on writing-paper and one on vellum, for private distribution, were issued of this work.

In 1752 Isaac Taylor of Ross bought the papers of Hill's brother, a schoolmaster in Herefordshire, for John Roberts, M.B., also of Ross, who indexed them and made additions. After Roberts's death in 1776 the collection, now about twenty volumes, passed back to Taylor, who sold them in 1778 to Thomas Clarke, F.S.A., principal registrar of the diocese of Hereford. On Clarke's death in March 1780 they came to the Rev. James Clarke. Clarke offered to sell them to John Allen the younger of Hereford, but they could not agree on a price. Via other hands and Belmont Priory, the papers came to Hereford City Library."]}]}}
