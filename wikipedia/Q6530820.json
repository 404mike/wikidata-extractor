Wolfit was also an important influence on the early acting career of Harold Pinter, who worked for the Donald Wolfit Company at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1953\u201354, performing eight roles with him.Billington, pp. 20\u201325; 31, 36, 37\u201341; \"Acting: The Donald Wolfit Company\", haroldpinter.org, accessed 9 October 2007. Wolfit long maintained a bitter hostility to John Gielgud, fuelled by Wolfit's resentment of Gielgud's public school background and family connections in the theatre. The actor Leslie French contrasted the two men: \"John was a very gentle person, very caring, with a lovely sense of humour. Donald was a joke, a terrible actor with no sense of humour, who believed he was the greatest in the world.
