Newcastle started to purchase talented players, especially from Scotland, and soon had a squad to rival all of England. With players like Colin Veitch, Jackie Rutherford, Jimmy Lawrence and Albert Shepherd, Newcastle had a team of international talent. Bill McCracken, Jimmy Howie, Peter McWilliam and Andy Aitken were also household names in their day. Long after his retirement, defender Peter McWilliam said \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot.\""]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Colin Veitch||||CB||1899\u20131914||322||49||"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Speirs", "response": ["Speirs was captain of the side and in the days up to the final he wrote to his opposite number, Colin Veitch.

Speirs led out a team which contained eight Scots for the final at the Crystal Palace on 22 April 1911 against Newcastle United. The game ended in a 0\u20130 draw, in what was described as a \"decidedly dull and uneventful game\"."]}]}}
