Willes played for Kent county cricket teams and was a fast underarm or, when he could get away with it, roundarm bowler.\nWilles played for the Gentlemen in the inaugural and second Gentlemen v Players matches in 1806.As Arthur Haygarth says in Scores & Biographies, John Willes was: \"...the originator, or rather the reviver, of round-armed bowling, and is said (though his daughter has never heard of the fact) to have caught the idea from seeing his sister so deliver the ball to him in practice when he was unwell.  The Cricket Field, however, speaking through William Beldham, states: Willes was not the inventor of that kind of round bowling\u2014he only revived what was forgotten or new to the young folk.  Whether he bowled round in the present match (i.e., in 1806), cannot now be said, as this kind of delivery was not tolerated till about 1827, when it was permanently established by William Lillywhite, Jem Broadbridge and Mr George T Knight. In the MCC v Kent match on 15 July 1822, Mr Willes commenced playing for his county but, being no-balled, he threw down the ball in high dudgeon, left the ground immediately, and (it is said) never played again.  Mr Willes was also a great sportsman, and kept a pack of hounds at Sutton.  This place, shortly before his death, he was obliged to leave, and he removed to Staunton, near Gloucester, where he died, in fearfully reduced circumstances on 5 August 1852, aged 74.  No tombstone has been erected to his memory\".\nIn fact, as Beldham confirmed, roundarm bowling was first devised back in Hambledon days by the wily Tom Walker but he was barred from using it in matches by the patrons of the day, including George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea.\nAfter Willes quit the game, his cause was taken up by Knight in particular and the style was used to great effect by Lillywhite and Broadbridge who were generally considered the two best bowlers in England during the 1820s.  Roundarm was the subject of trial matches in 1827 but not actually legalised until 1835, though in the meantime the umpires turned a blind eye.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["This was roundarm, so-called because the hand is held out from the body (i.e., between waist and shoulder height) at the point of delivery.  The roundarm style was promoted successively by John Willes, William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge until it was finally legalised, amid furious controversy, in 1835 with an amendment to the rule in 1845."]}, {"page": "Gentlemen v Players", "response": ["A curiosity of these matches is that they featured the veteran professional Tom Walker and the rookie amateur John Willes: these two players were both credited with devising the roundarm style of bowling, but there is no evidence to suggest they used roundarm in 1806."]}, {"page": "Roundarm bowling", "response": ["The idea of roundarm is sometimes attributed to Christiana Willes, sister of Kent cricketer John Willes. The story goes that when bowling to her brother in the garden at home in the 1800s,  Willes found herself inconvenienced by her large, lead-weighted dress which prevented her from performing the underarm action. Elevating the arm to just above waist height, she bowled without interference from her attire. According to John Major in More Than A Game, the story is unlikely to be true for reasons of fashion more than cricket because hooped skirts were out of fashion during the period of the Napoleonic War.", "Whatever the origin, John Willes realised that the pace and bounce generated by this raised arm action made the delivery potentially more difficult to play than a conventional underarm one and so he adopted the style himself with his arm coming through at shoulder height. He tried, without success, to have it accepted in senior cricket."]}, {"page": "Lord Frederick Beauclerk", "response": ["Beauclerk persuaded MCC to call a meeting to ban roundarm bowling in 1822 even though he had been known to claim wagers when playing alongside the early roundarmers like John Willes.

Willes promptly withdrew from the match and refused to play again in any important fixture. Roundarm was a natural reaction to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the legalisation of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions."]}, {"page": "Kent county cricket teams", "response": ["In the 1822 MCC versus Kent match at Lord\u2019s, John Willes of Kent opened the bowling and was no-balled for using a roundarm action, a style he had attempted to introduce since 1807.

Hodges' account makes mention neither of crinoline nor of roundarm bowling, merely that Christiana, John and their dog could beat any eleven in England. The ODNB states that the story was picked up in Hodges' obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and subsequently retold by F. S. Ashley-Cooper in Highways and Byways (1927); it was rejected by Rowland Bowen in Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development (1970);Bowen, pp. 180\u2013181. but tentatively accepted by other writers as part of the folklore of cricket."]}]}}
