The slow advances of some of the twelve battalions took place behind a creeping barrage and were the most successful attacks of the day. Prior and Wilson wrote that the deciding factor in the success of British infantry battalions was the destructive effect of British artillery; if German gunners and machine-gun crews survived the bombardment, no infantry tactic could overcome their firepower."]}, {"page": "Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein", "response": ["The wreck location at Stendal, and the site of Ostheimer's parachute landing at Sch\u00f6nhausen, which both lie on the bombers' approach route to Magdeburg, are more than  from the area where Snape and Fowler reported their contact. It is also likely that Sayn-Wittgenstein was shot down only a few minutes after his last victory at 22:40, while Snape and Fowler claimed their Ju\u00a088 damaged (not destroyed) over half an hour later. Sayn-Wittgenstein was in the bomber stream, where Mosquito fighters did not venture because the bombers would fire on any twin-engined aircraft, and he would not have had his navigation lights illuminated. Historians Alfred Price and Martin Middlebrook have both suggested that Sayn-Wittgenstein was shot down by a bomber. Three RAF bomber crews returning from the raid filed claims for German night fighters shot down. Two claimed Ju\u00a088s in the vicinity of Magdeburg and one claimed a Bf\u00a0110. These claims appear to be in line with German records which show the Luftwaffe lost two Ju\u00a088s, one Bf\u00a0110 and one Heinkel He 219 that night. The He\u00a0219 was that of Hauptmann Manfred Meurer, credited with 65 victories, who apparently collided with his final victim, a Lancaster. The wrecks of the two aircraft were found locked together and there were no survivors from either crew. One of the bomber crews claiming a Ju\u00a088 shot down near Magdeburg was a Pathfinder Lancaster crew from No. 156 Squadron RAF. Their tail gunner, Flight Lieutenant T.R. Thomson from Edinburgh, fired on a Ju\u00a088 at close range during its second approach and saw it go down.
