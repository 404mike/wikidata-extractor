From there he joined the first in-store radio station, Radio Topshop, at Topshop's store on Oxford Circus in London. By 1986, Warren was presenting shows on Metro Radio, covering the north-east of England, and he remained with the station until September 1988, when he accepted a 2-year posting with BFBS in Cyprus, but returned home after six months, citing homesickness. On returning to England, he joined TFM. After a further four months in the north-east, he was hired as a presenter of Children's ITV's summer mornings & afternoons service in July 1989 alongside Jeanne Downs, and returned for the following year, hosting alongside fellow presenters Nick Owen and Scally the Dog. After leaving ITV in 1990 he joined Capital FM, initially presenting an overnight slot as well as covering other shows. He later presented the early weekend morning show and also the weekday overnight slots."]}, {"page": "Genesis Revisited", "response": ["*Jeanne Downs \u2013 backing vocals (7)"]}, {"page": "CITV", "response": ["Whereas Central had restricted links to the station's former in-vision presentation studio, Stonewall chose not to use a fixed set, but instead presented links from various areas of Central's headquarters at Broad Street in Birmingham, utilising a rotating team of presenters which included Clive Warren (now a DJ), Jeanne Downs (a singer), Jerry Foulkes (a producer who left Children's ITV on 22\u00a0December 1989) and a large puppet dog called Scally (who started out with Mark during his last few months).", "* Jeanne Downs (Summer mornings 1989 & 1990, Afternoons; January 1990 \u2013 April 1991)"]}, {"page": "Jerry Foulkes", "response": ["Foulkes left CITV on 22 December 1989, and on 2 January 1990, fellow CITV presenter Jeanne Downs (who had presented CITV's summer mornings service in 1989) took over co-presenting the afternoons with Scally, until 29 March 1991, when Stonewall lost the contract to produce CITV back to Central Television (who had also done it previously from 1983 to 1989).

In Summer 1989, when Stonewall's Children's ITV summer mornings service launched, he appeared with new recruits, Clive Warren and Jeanne Downs. Scally had several catchphrases that he often used on Children's ITV, one of which was: \"Yes, indeedy!\", which he usually said when he was happy about something.
