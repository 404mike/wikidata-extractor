The band took their name from an episode of radio comedy programme The Goon Show. The band are unusual for using two bass-players in their line-up: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Matt Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums.The band was formed at sixth-form college and they recorded their first album while some members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd-surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990). In 2009, Jonn Penney stated, \"We're still adding designs - old habits die hard\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ned's Atomic Dustbin", "response": ["Singer Penney formed a new band, Groundswell (initially featuring Ned's Atomic Dustbin guitarist, Rat), who recorded one single, \"Corrode\", and a studio album Plausible/Infeasible for New Jersey-based indie label, Gig Records. They disbanded shortly thereafter - in fact, the album was only actually released after their demise.", "Ned's Atomic Dustbin took the stage in 2000 for the first time since their initial breakup for a show in Dudley with Groundswell members Andy King and Martin Warlow taking the place of Mat Cheslin and Rat.  Originally billed as \"the last 30 minutes of Ned's Atomic Dustbin,\" it was intended as an opportunity to say a proper goodbye to British fans who never got to see a final Ned's show.  However, the resounding success convinced members of the band to continue working together, and they continue to perform sporadically ever since.  2004 saw the band perform two new songs, \"Hibernation\" and \"Ambush\". In 2005 they again played a few late-December gigs, and on 5 June 2006 their first new single in 11 years, \"Hibernation\", was released, supported with a weekend concert series called \"Ned-Fest\". The single was available as both a download and a CD, available to buy online via their website.", "Encouraged by Miles Hunt to perform some songs acoustically, Ned's Acoustic Dustbin was born in 2017. Featuring Jonn and Rat, the duo released the album Ned's Acoustic Dustbin in 2019 which featured versions of such tracks as \"Intact\" and \"All I Ask of Myself Is That I Hold Together\" without drums or bass.
