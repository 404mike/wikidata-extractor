Inman's service in the American war was punctuated by three shipwrecks: the burning of HMS Lark off Rhode Island in the face of a superior French squadron, the grounding of HMS Santa Monica on Tortola and the foundering of Hector following an engagement with two French ships in the Mid-Atlantic. After the war he was placed in reserve until the Spanish Armament of 1790, when he was given command of the 14-gun cutter HMS Pygmy stationed off the Isle of Man.\nInman's subsequent service career was principally in frigates: he was engaged at the Siege of Toulon in HMS Aurore, in a raid at Dunkirk in HMS Andromeda and participated in the Battle of Copenhagen as captain of HMS D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. He later served on the ship of the line HMS Triumph at the Battle of Cape Finisterre and was subsequently called to give evidence at the court martial of Sir Robert Calder. After the battle off Finisterre, Inman suffered from ill-health and remained on shore duty until 1809 when he was appointed as Admiralty commissioner for Madras. The lengthy sea journey to India exacerbated his existing health problems and he died just ten days after his arrival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Copenhagen (1801)", "response": ["* D\u00e9sir\u00e9e 36 (Captain Henry Inman)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)", "response": ["| (74), Capt.

The small craft included four fireships, small brigs designed to operate as minor warships until such time as they were deemed expendable in an attack on an anchored target, and the sloop HMS Dart under Commander Patrick Campbell. Dart was a highly unusual ship: her size meant that she was unrated even though her armament included thirty 32-pounder carronades. The carronades were mounted to a new design that minimised recoil and made them faster and easier to load.James, p. 42"]}, {"page": "Henry Inman", "response": ["Henry Inman may refer to:", "*Henry Inman (Royal Navy officer) (1762\u20131809), British Royal Navy officer", "*Henry Inman (painter) (1801\u20131846), American portrait, genre, and landscape painter", "*Henry Inman (police commander) (1816\u20131895), cavalry officer, founder and first commander of the South Australia Police", "*Henry Inman (U.S. Army officer and author) (1837-1899), U.S. soldier and author", "*Henry Inman (wrestler) (1886-1967), British Olympic wrestler"]}, {"page": "Salusbury Pryce Humphreys", "response": ["After the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in August 1799 Humphreys left Juno and moved to the 50-gun , which was then the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell with the Channel Fleet.
