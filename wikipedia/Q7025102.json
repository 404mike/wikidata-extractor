He was born in Johannesburg, but has played all his important cricket in England.\nBoulton started playing for Somerset's second XI in 1995, and an innings of 112 against Glamorgan II in July 1997 won him promotion two weeks later to make his first-class debut in the tour match against Pakistan A. He made scores of 1 and 14, and immediately returned to the seconds, where he spent two and a half more frustrating years.\nFor the 2000 season, Boulton moved to Worcestershire, but again he could not force his way into the first team. The following summer was a different story he played five List A games in May alone. He did not grasp that opportunity, however, making 22*, 4, 6*, 1 and 1, and he was once more dropped. He did play another two one-day and four first-class games that season, but in none of them did he produce the sizeable scores he had made in the second team, and Worcestershire released him at the end of the year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oblomov", "response": ["In 2005 BBC Radio 4 made a two-part English language dramatisation, heralding the lead character as a tragic-comic hero for a couch potato generation.
