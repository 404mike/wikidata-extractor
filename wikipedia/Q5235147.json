He has been described as a man who has never striven more to contradict his name. Miss Marple describes him as having the same personality as that of a diesel engine, most unappealing, but efficient. When Slack first met Miss Marple, her strange personality and her quirky methods caused him to think she was batty, and thus took no notice of her. Slack especially disliked the fact that his superiors think highly of Miss Marple and consult her for advice (although he later ends up doing the same). Usually, Slack passes over Miss Marple's beliefs and dislikes her interfering, although he later comes to value her advice. In his final appearance, it is revealed that Slack has been promoted to Superintendent and appears to have grown wiser, even telling an officer to consult Miss Marple. In \"They Do It with Mirrors\" it is revealed that Slack has a secret passion for magic tricks, and secretly practises. Slack is featured in the novels The Murder at the Vicarage and The Body in the Library.", "|Gwen Watford, Moray Watson, Trudie Styler, Jess Conrad, Ciaran Madden, Keith Drinkel, Debbie Arnold, Frederick Jaeger, Valentine Dyall, Raymond Francis, David Horovitch, Anthony Smee, Andrew Cruickshank, Hugh Walters, Arthur Bostrom, Stephen Churchett, John Moffatt"]}, {"page": "Foyle's War (series 1)", "response": ["|colspan=\"6\"|Guests: Robert Hardy, Rosamund Pike, Benedict Sandiford, Edward Fox, David Horovitch, Joanna Kanska, Andrew Powell, Paul Putner, Tom Chadbon, Neil Conrich, Sam Troughton, James McAvoy, Philip Whitchurch, Dominic Mafham"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* David Horovitch"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac cast members", "response": ["*David Horovitch"]}, {"page": "Just William (book series)", "response": ["In 1994, the BBC broadcast another series also called Just William.
