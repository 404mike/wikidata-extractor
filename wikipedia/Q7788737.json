He requested colonial service, and spent five years in Africa, where he was involved in the creation of the West African Frontier Force and served in a number of campaigns in northern Nigeria. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, he was appointed as Deputy Commissioner in Somaliland, where he mounted a series of campaigns against the Dervish State.\nHe requested a transfer to the Western Front in 1916, and commanded an infantry battalion and a brigade before being promoted to take command of 38th (Welsh) Division in early 1918. He led the division until the Armistice, with marked success. Following the war, he held a series of peacetime commands in Germany, Egypt, and England, before being made Governor of Bermuda in 1931. He held this position until 1936, when he retired.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Cubitt", "response": ["Thomas Cubitt (25 February 1788 \u2013 20 December 1855) was a British master builder, notable for his employment in developing many of the historic streets and squares of London, especially in Belgravia, Pimlico and Bloomsbury.", "In 1827 he withdrew from the management of his Gray's Inn Road concern leaving this to his brother William Cubitt; the firm of Cubitts still carried out the work of Thomas Cubitt and the change robbed neither partner of the credit for their work."]}, {"page": "Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay", "response": ["In early 1914, just before Ismay's appointment as adjutant was set to expire, he met C.

In the attack, Ismay fought closely alongside Adrian Carton de Wiart, later an important British officer in both World Wars.Beachey, p. 109. Not long after the attack on Shimber Berris, however, the Camel Corps received orders from London \"forbidding all offensive operations in Somaliland\", due to the misfortunes of the Army elsewhere.Ismay, p. 28. As a result of this order, British operations were limited for the duration of the First World War, and Ismay's unit undertook no further major offensives.Ismay, pp. 28\u201329."]}, {"page": "53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["|Major-General Thomas Cubitt"]}, {"page": "38th (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["At this point, Major-General Charles Blackader left the division on medical grounds and was replaced by Major-General Thomas Cubitt.
