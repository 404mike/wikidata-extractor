His grandfather Rhys Fawr ap Maredudd had fought at Bosworth with Henry VII.\nEllis studied at St Nicholas Hostel, Cambridge and was awarded BCL in 1533 and DCL in 1534 and from the red gown of his degree was known as \u2018Y Doctor Coch\u2019 (\u2018The Red Doctor\u2019).In 1535 he was appointed visitor of monasteries in Wales by Thomas Cromwell and played a leading role in their subsequent destruction. There were complaints about his immorality and arrogance and he was dismissed. In 1538 he became chancellor and commissary-general of the Diocese of St Asaph and sinecure rector of Llangwm, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos and Llanuwchllyn. At about this time he was sued in Chancery by the vicar of Llanarmon, Denbighshire, who complained that Price aided and abetted in the misappropriation of tithes; he also took part in an assault upon the Welsh scholar and translator of the New Testament into Welsh, William Salesbury of Llanrwst, Denbighshire, who was his brother-in-law.He was a Justice of the Peace for Merioneth in 1543 and from 1555 to his death, for Denbighshire from 1555 to his death, for Caernarvonshire from 1561 to his death, for Anglesey and Montgomeryshire in 1564, and for most Welsh counties by 1575. He was appointed High Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1548\u201349, 1556\u201357, 1568\u201369 and 1572\u201373 and High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1551\u201352, 1555\u201356, 1563\u201364, 1567\u201368, 1573\u201374, 1578\u201379 and 1583\u201384. In the intervening years he also served as High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire (1558\u201359) and High Sheriff of Anglesey (1577\u201378 and 1585\u201386).He was elected MP for Merioneth in 1558 and 1563. Other offices included Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire from 1558/59 to 1577 or later, member of the Council in the Marches of Wales from 1560 to his death, and Master in Chancery extraordinary.In 1560, the Crown awarded him the manor of Tir Ifan, with lands at Ysbyty Ifan and Penmachno. When Queen Elizabeth gave the lordship of Denbigh as a gift to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1564, Price, as steward of the estates, carried out acts of oppression in the area. He was on the commission granted by Elizabeth to hold the Eisteddfod at Caerwys in 1567.He married twice: firstly to Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Conway of Bodrhyddan, Flintshire, who bore him a son; and secondly to Ellyw, the daughter of Owain Pool, rector of Llandecwyn, Merioneth, who delivered two further sons and four daughters. His third son was the adventurer poet Tomos Prys.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Salesbury", "response": ["Salesbury was born some time before 1520 (possibly as early as 1507) in the parish of Llansannan, Conwy.  He was the second son of Ffwg Salesbury (d. 1520) and Annes, daughter of Wiliam ap Gruffydd ap Robin o Gochwillan.  By 1540 he had moved to Plas Isa, Llanrwst; this had been the residence of both his father and his brother.    He was probably educated locally, and was certainly influenced by the literary traditions of the Vale of Clwyd. He then studied at Oxford University, probably living in Broadgates Hall.  Here he studied the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, and became familiar with the (banned) writings of Martin Luther and William Tyndale as well as the technology of printing.  Here too he was caught up in the renaissance of learning.  Mathias suggests that it was at Oxford that Salesbury left the Roman Catholic church and became a Protestant.  Although there is no record of his either having taken a degree at Oxford or having gone on to one of the inns of court, it is known that in 1550 he was at Thavies Inn.  Although he spent considerable time in London, there is no evidence of his having travelled abroad.  His wife was Catrin Llwyd, sister of Ellis Price.  She died around 1572."]}, {"page": "Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire", "response": ["* Ellis Price bef. 1558 \u2013 bef. 1562", "* Ellis Price bef. 1564 \u2013 aft.1577"]}, {"page": "Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1558|| Ellis Price", "|1563 (Jan)|| Ellis Price"]}, {"page": "Tomos Prys", "response": ["Tomos Prys (c.1564\u20131634) was a Welsh soldier, sailor and poet.
