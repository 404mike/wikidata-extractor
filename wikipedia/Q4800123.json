He was educated at Eton College, where he played for the college cricket eleven.Richards made his first-class debut for Hampshire in 1884 against Sussex. Richards made two appearances for Hampshire in the 1884 season, the second of which was against Somerset in what was to be Hampshire's final season with first-class status until the 1895 County Championship.\nNine years after Hampshire had regained their first-class status and nineteen years after last representing the county, Richards played a single first-class match in 1903 against Essex. Richards final first-class appearance for Hampshire came in 1904 against Sussex.\nIn his four first-class matches for Hampshire, Richards scored 104 runs at a batting average of 17.33, with a high score of 47. With the ball Richards took 3 wickets at a bowling average of 37.33, with best figures of 3/45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Richards", "response": ["Arthur Richards may refer to:", "* Arthur Richards, 1st Baron Milverton (1885\u20131978), British colonial administrator", "* Arthur Richards (cricketer) (1865\u20131930), English cricketer", "* Arthur Richards (French politician) (1890\u20131972), member of the French National Assembly, 1958\u20131967"]}, {"page": "Stephen Newton", "response": ["Newton suffered a slow start to his 1883 campaign, failing to pass 10 runs in his first five innings. His improvements improved in his next three matches, highlighted by a half-century against Gloucestershire, scored during a 135 run partnership with Edward Sainsbury. His batting average for the season was almost half that of the previous year, and despite playing two additional innings he scored two less half-centuries than in 1882. In his first match for Somerset in 1884, Newton claimed his only wickets in first-class cricket. Bowling with a style that is not recorded on CricketArchive or Cricinfo, he claimed the wickets of Hampshire's Arthur Richards and HH Armstrong, both batsmen being caught off his bowling. Newton utilised himself as a bowler only after using every other member of the side, with the exception of wicket-keeper Francis Terry. In his next match, Newton avoided a pair against Lancashire by top-scoring in Somerset's second innings with 62. That score was to be the last half-century of Newton's season, and his last in first-class cricket for Somerset. He added two further scores above 30 against Kent, scoring 46 and 31, He played three less innings than in the previous season, but surpassed his total runs from that season, and improved his average to 24.22. In his three years of first-class cricket for Somerset, he scored no centuries, five half-centuries, and averaged 24.56 with the bat, higher than he finished with any other first-class cricket side."]}]}}
