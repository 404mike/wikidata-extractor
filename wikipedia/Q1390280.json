It 'accepted' credentials from international ambassadors to Ireland, something no other dominion up to then had done. It registered the treaty with the League of Nations as an international document, over the objections of the United Kingdom, which saw it as a mere internal document between a dominion and the United Kingdom. Entitlement of citizenship of the Free State was defined in the Irish Free State Constitution, but the status of that citizenship was contentious. One of the first projects of the Free State was the design and production of the Great Seal of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann which was carried out on behalf of the Government by Hugh Kennedy."]}, {"page": "Constitution of the Irish Free State", "response": ["Shortly after the British evacuated their troops from Dublin Castle in January 1922, Michael Collins set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent Irish Free State which would come into being in December 1922.Address to the Constitutional Convention, Dublin Castle, 1 December 2012 by Gerard Hogan, judge of the High Court of Ireland  Mr Collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point (he died before the constitution was finalised) was its chairman. Darrell Figgis, the vice-chairman became acting Chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, James McNeill and John O'Byrne. B was signed by James G. Douglas, C.J. France and Hugh Kennedy and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive.Douglas p81 This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by Alfred O'Rahilly and James Murnaghan, and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the D\u00e1il in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state.Douglas p85 The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The Irish language version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, Eoin MacNeill; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille; the Clerk of the D\u00e1il, Colm \u00d3 Murchadha; Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed; Liam \u00d3 Rinn and Professors Osborn Bergin and T.

John O'Byrne was the sole King's Counsel (KC) appointed after independence, in June 1924 when he was Attorney General of Ireland. Shortly after the Courts of Justice Act 1924 came into effect, Chief Justice Hugh Kennedy, in conjunction with the Bar Council of Ireland, revived the issue of patents of precedence, which had been used in the 18th and 19th century as an alternative to a patent as KC, but had fallen into disuse from 1883 as the strictures formerly associated with the rank of KC were abolished. The Free State patent wording was based on that issued to Daniel O'Connell; the recipient would be styled \"Senior Counsel\" (SC) (; ). According to the view held at the time, the \"privilege of patent\" was part of the royal prerogative within the Free State. The early patents were issued under the Free State's [internal] Great Seal by the Governor-General as the King's representative, on the advice of the Executive Council (government). On 14 July 1924 the Chief Justice called the first recipients to the \"within the bar\" and bestowed their patents.  The form of the 1924 patent omitted the appointment as \"one of our counsel learned in the law\" from the KC patent, but retained its grant of \"precedence and preaudience\" to rank next after the previously appointed KC or SC. The Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the office of Governor-General and the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937 was held to have transferred the royal prerogative to the Executive Council (government). Although the 1937 Constitution of Ireland created the office of President of Ireland, it was still the Taoiseach as head of government who signed patents of precedence under the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937."]}, {"page": "Great Seal of the Irish Free State", "response": ["Regarding the design of the Great Seal, an approach was made by Hugh Kennedy, the Attorney General, to Thomas Sadleir, Registrar of the Office of Arms at Dublin Castle. In his reply Sadlier noted that he was \"satisfied that the harp was very early in the 12th century an Irish badge...\". The 1919\u20131922 seal of the revolutionary D\u00e1il of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic showed a harp surrounded by the words \"Sigullum Reipublicae Hibernicae \u2014 Seala Saorst\u00e1it \u00c9ireann\". By contrast, the 1922 Provisional Government's seal was a quartering of the arms of the four provinces. The Provisional Government's private secretary suggested to Hugh Kennedy a similar seal for the Free State: \"If considered desirable to symbolise in the design the present partition of Ulster, this could be done by leaving the Arms incomplete and broken at the corner.\". George Sigerson, the President of the National Literary Society, recommended to Tim Healy, the new Governor-General, that the harp should be adopted as the symbol of the Free State. His view was that:", "Ancilllary to the abolition of the Governor-Generalship, the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 continued the use of the External Great Seal by the King. The distinction between the two Great Seals was not always clearly understood. In 1932,  Hugh Kennedy, by then Chief Justice, was under the impression that the internal and external seals were in the custody respectively of the Executive Council and Governor-General.Sexton 1989 p.137 No.10 The 1937 Constitution of Ireland created the office of President of Ireland, and the Seal of the President was created for the President's formal signature of official documents in the same manner as the internal Free State seal had been used, and having the same design except substituting \"\u00c9ire\" for \"Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\", since the constitution had changed the name of the state. The text on the reverse of External Great Seal was changed likewise, and the British monarch, George VI, continued to sign diplomatic documents using it. This dichotomy reflected ambiguity over who was head of state. The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 transferred diplomatic functions to the President, rendering the External Great Seal obsolete.", "* Various designs for the Free State Great Seal, created in pen and ink by A.

Glenavy clashed with another member of the Committee,  Hugh Kennedy, soon to become the first Chief Justice of Ireland, who was in favour of far more radical changes than those recommended by Glenavy  and a majority of the Committee.
