Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner Peter Christopherson (formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle). Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band's career included Stephen Thrower, Danny Hyde, Drew McDowall, William Breeze, Thighpaulsandra, and Ossian Brown. Coil's work explored themes related to alchemy, the occult, and sexuality, influencing genres such as goth rock, neofolk, and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group \"one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial scene.\"", "Shortly after in May 1984, Coil went on to record their first full-length studio album, eventually titled Scatology, approaching JG Thirlwell as a co-producer and co-composer; several others contributors, including Stephen Thrower, Alex Fergusson and Gavin Friday, took part in its recording.; .

In a career spanning from 1954 to 2013, he wrote, directed, produced, acted in, and scored approximately 173 feature films,Stephen Thrower, Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes\u00fas Franco (2015) working both in his native Spain and (during the rule of Francisco Franco), in France, West Germany, Switzerland and Portugal. Additionally, during the 1960s, he made several films in Rio de Janeiro and Istanbul.", "After discovering Soledad Miranda (he first used her in his film Count Dracula), Franco moved from Spain to France in 1969 so that he could make more violent and erotic films free of the strict censorship in Spain at the time, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with an accent on adult material. Miranda starred in a series of six erotic thrillers for Franco, all made within a one-year period (including Vampyros Lesbos), after which she was killed in a tragic automobile accident in Portugal in 1970, just as her career was taking off. She and Franco had started filming her next project (Justine) which he abandoned entirely after her death. (Only about 40 minutes of the movie was shot at the time of her death). He had also planned to feature her in his next film, X-312: Flight to Hell, which he made with another actress.Stephen Thrower, Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes\u00fas Franco (2015)", "A year or two after Miranda died, a grieving Franco discovered a new leading lady in actress Lina Romay. At the time, the teenage Romay was married to a young actor/photographer named Ramon Ardid (aka \"Raymond Hardy\"), and Ardid co-starred with Lina in 19 of Franco's films in the 1970s. But as she and Franco became more involved in their film projects together over the years, her marriage to Ardid broke up in 1975 and ended in divorce in 1978 (although Ardid continued working with Franco until 1980).Stephen Thrower, Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes\u00fas Franco (2015) ", "Franco and Romay worked together for 40 years, and lived together from 1980 onward, although they were only officially married on 25 April 2008. Until her death in 2012 (from cancer at age 57), Romay was his most regular actress, as well as his life companion and muse. Romay starred in more Franco films than any other actor or actress. Although Romay was listed in the credits of several films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, although she never actually co-directed any of their films together.Stephen Thrower, Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes\u00fas Franco (2015)", "His main claim to fame, however, is that he managed to direct approximately 173 motion pictures in his lifetime,Stephen Thrower, Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes\u00fas Franco (2015) encompassing a wide swath of different genres with practically no financial backing available to him.
