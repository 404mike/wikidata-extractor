She pursued her degree in Paris, graduating in 1880 after six years of study, so that she could continue her animal advocacy from a position of authority. Her final thesis, L'Alimentation V\u00e9g\u00e9tale de l'Homme, was on the benefits of vegetarianism,  published in English as The Perfect Way in Diet (1881). She founded the Food Reform Society that year, travelling within the UK to talk about vegetarianism, and to Paris, Geneva, and Lausanne to speak out against animal experimentation.Kingsford was interested in Buddhism and Gnosticism, and became active in the Theosophical movement in England, becoming president of the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society in 1883. In 1884 she founded the Hermetic Society, which lasted until 1887 when her health declined. She said she received insights in trance-like states and in her sleep; these were collected from her manuscripts and pamphlets by her lifelong collaborator Edward Maitland, and published posthumously in the book, Clothed with the Sun (1889). Subject to ill-health all her life, she died of lung disease at the age of 41, brought on by a bout of pneumonia. Her writing was virtually unknown for over 100 years after Maitland published her biography, The Life of Anna Kingsford (1896), though Helen Rappaport wrote in 2001 that her life and work are once again being studied.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 22", "response": ["*1888 \u2013 Anna Kingsford, English physician and activist (b. 1846)"]}, {"page": "September 16", "response": ["*1846 \u2013 Anna Kingsford, English author, poet, and activist (d. 1888)"]}, {"page": "1888", "response": ["* February 22\u00a0\u2013 Anna Kingsford, British women's rights activist (b. 1846)"]}, {"page": "1846", "response": ["* September 16 \u2013 Anna Kingsford, British spiritual writer, doctor, feminist and pioneering vegetarian (d. 1888)"]}, {"page": "Helena Blavatsky", "response": ["Sailing to Marseilles, France, in March 1883, she spent time in Nice with the founder of the Theosophical Society's French branch, the Countess of Caithness (widow of James Sinclair, 14th Earl of Caithness), with whom she continued to Paris.
