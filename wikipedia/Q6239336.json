He also works on industrial problems involving fluid dynamics, including collaborating with experimental groups in Paris, Marseille and Toulouse. He lectures undergraduates at the University of Cambridge, is a Director of Studies for Trinity College, and supervises PhD students.\nJohn Hinch has published more than a hundred papers on fluid dynamics. Since 1997 he has been a Fellow of the Royal Society and he is also a Knight of the Ordre National du M\u00e9rite of France and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 2012, Hinch was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the mechanics of fluids, suspensions, and polymeric liquids and to industrial processes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hinch (surname)", "response": ["*John Hinch (mathematician), mathematician", "*John Hinch (musician), British drummer"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*John Hinch, fluid dynamicist, retired 2014 "]}, {"page": "Fluid Dynamics Prize (APS)", "response": ["* 2010: E.
