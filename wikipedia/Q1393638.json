His father abandoned the family when Richmond was 3. Before he got into freestyle wrestling, he was a whale ship crewman.\nAt 6'5\" and 265 lbs, he won a bronze medal at the 1952 Olympics, as well as a bronze medal at the 1950 British Empire Games, and a gold medal at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.  He stayed fit enough into his later years to win medals for rollerblading and windsurfing in his 60s.Though he appeared as the wrestler Nikolas in Jules Dassin's film noir, Night and the City (1950), Richmond was perhaps most recognisable as the shirtless gongman banging the enormous gong preceding the opening credits for films produced or distributed by the Rank Organisation. He was the fourth - and last - actor to take the job. According to the BBC, he had revealed to friends that the gong seen in the Rank Organisation's opening never rang, as it was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 stage prop and he never actually struck it with any force, joking \"If you hit that gong, you would have gone straight through.\"He was a Jehovah's Witness for most of his life, being jailed as a conscientious objector during World War II. In later life, he was a volunteer minister for the organisation. He died at age 80 in his home in Christchurch. (Richmond\u2019s wife, Valentina, died in 1996).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Kenneth Richmond \u2014 Wrestling, Men's Freestyle Heavyweight"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Kenneth Richmond"]}, {"page": "Ken Richmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Richmond"]}, {"page": "List of amateur wrestlers", "response": ["*Kenneth Richmond \u2013 1952 Olympic bronze medalist"]}, {"page": "Richmond (surname)", "response": ["*Kenneth Richmond (1926\u20132006), British wrestler"]}, {"page": "England at the 1950 British Empire Games", "response": ["| Kenneth Richmond     ||23|| Actor     ||bronze"]}, {"page": "England at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Kenneth Richmond                      ||28||Heavyweight||1 x gold"]}, {"page": "England at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Kenneth Richmond          || Heavyweight||"]}]}}
