In the first Test, England recalled Eric Hollies and selected three debutants: Sam Cook, Tom Dollery and Jack Martin. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with Charlie Barnett replacing Dollery, George Pope replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by Cliff Gladwin while  Ken Cranston was brought in to replace Pope.

They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "Copson", "response": ["*Bill Copson (1908\u20131971), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Albert Alderman", "response": ["Alderman kept his first-team place throughout the golden years of the early to mid-1930s when, despite placing tenth in the 1932 County Championship table, fresh blood in the team was to give them their first, and as yet, only County Championship capture in 1936. During these years, Alderman was able to keep his batting average ticking over and around the 25 mark, and, having played more times during the 1936 season than any other to date, cemented his place in the Derbyshire opening attack, most notably with Test cricketer Stan Worthington and sometime wicket-keeper Harry Storer alongside him. Alderman was also noted for his deep fielding. At The Oval in 1936, Surrey batsman Tom Barling swept a ball from Bill Copson to leg which looked as if it was carrying for six. Alderman sprinted 30 yards round the fine-leg boundary to catch it with his outstretched right hand just above the palings.
