His specific interest in experience can be traced back to the works of William James (1842\u20131910), F. H. Bradley (1846\u20131924), Henri Bergson (1859\u20131941), and Friedrich von H\u00fcgel (1852\u20131925), and to Vivekananda (1863\u20131902), who had a strong influence on Sarvepalli's thought. According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying character (svatassiddha), self-evidencing (sv\u0101sa\u1e43vedya), and self-luminous (svayam-prak\u0101sa). In his book An Idealist View of Life, he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought. According to Radhakrishnan, intuition plays a specific role in all kinds of experience."]}]}}
