The team name was chosen based on its association with the Braves, which like the Chiefs also used Native American imagery in their branding. On September 8, Cecil made one of the first hires on the team with Phil Woosnam as head coach and player. Team tryouts were held on the campus of Emory University, which also housed the Chiefs' training facility. The initial roster included notable international players such as Vic Crowe, Peter McParland, and Vic Rouse. The Chiefs opened their first season with an away game against the Baltimore Bays on April 16, 1967. The game, a 1\u20130 loss for the Chiefs, is notable for being the first professional soccer match to be televised in the United States. Before the game, the players on both teams were introduced holding flags of the countries they were from, and a band played \"Dixie\" prior to kick-off. The Chiefs would finish their debut season with a win\u2013loss\u2013tie record of 10\u20139\u201312.
