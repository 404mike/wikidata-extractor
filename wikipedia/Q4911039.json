His birthplace was only 50 yards from Griffin Park and he made one wartime appearance before signing as a professional for Leyton Orient in April 1946. He spent the 1946\u201347 season playing for Orient in the Third Division South before moving to The Dell in June 1947, with Bill Stroud moving in the opposite direction."]}, {"page": "Doug McGibbon", "response": ["During the 1945\u201346 season, Southampton played in the League South pending the resumption of League football following the end of the war. During the league season, McGibbon made 30 appearances scoring 27 goals, including six in a 7\u20130 victory over Chelsea on 29 December 1945. In this match, McGibbon scored his third goal within five seconds of the kick-off for the second half. McGibbon kicked off to Ted Bates, who passed the ball wide to Bill Stroud, who immediately hit a long ball into the path of McGibbon, who had sprinted upfield. McGibbon hit a firm volley into the back of the net without a Chelsea player having touched the ball. The referee timed the goal at 4.6 seconds from the kick-off \u2013 this remains the fastest goal ever scored by a Southampton player from a kick-off, although the Dell pitch had been shortened slightly due to bomb damage at the Milton Road end. In total, including FA Cup matches, McGibbon scored 29 goals from 34 appearances in 1945\u201346, although his form did tail off towards the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Bill Bushby (footballer)", "response": ["During the Second World War, Bushby played the majority of his football with Folland Aircraft Football Club, a team formed by the workers of Folland Aircraft, although also appeared for Southampton and Chelsea in a number of unofficial wartime matches. Following the end of the conflicts, Bushby moved permanently to Southampton in September 1946, appearing twice for the club at right half in games against West Bromwich Albion on 5 October 1946 and Birmingham City on 1 February 1947. Ultimately he could not retain his position in the team ahead of players like Bill Stroud and George Smith though, and left near the end of the season to join Cowes."]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Bill Stroud", "|align=\"left\"|Bill Stroud", "|align=\"left\"|Bill Stroud", "| Bill Stroud"]}]}}
