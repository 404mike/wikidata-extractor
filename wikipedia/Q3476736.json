In his first season as coach, he guided Edinburgh to the highest ever finish by a Scottish side at that time in the Celtic League (joint 3rd), despite numerous international players leaving the previous summer for more lucrative contracts in England and France. The following season (2008\u201309) Edinburgh leap-frogged Leinster and the Ospreys on the final day of the competition to finish runners-up behind Munster. Edinburgh also finished highest points scorers. He stepped down in June 2009 to take up the role of head coach of Scotland, replacing Frank Hadden. Although his time as Scotland coach included a 2\u20130 series win in Argentina and home wins over Australia and South Africa \u2013 the latter advancing Scotland to a record sixth place in the world rankings \u2013 his stint ended after a string of disappointing results, culminating in defeat by Tonga on 24 November 2012 which was followed a day later by his resignation."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Rugby", "response": ["For the 2005\u201306 season, the Edinburgh team found itself looking for a new coach after the departure of Frank Hadden to coach Scotland. Sean Lineen, then Glasgow Warriors assistant coach, was linked with the post before Todd Blackadder acquired the position for the season after a spell as interim coach. During the same season the team nickname was incorporated into the official name, which became the Edinburgh Gunners. The \"Gunners\" moniker was dropped on 29 September 2006, after the club had become Scottish rugby's first private franchise during the summer. The team name reverted to Edinburgh Rugby. One reason for the change was that the name The Gunners was already a registered Trademark of Arsenal Football Club. Another reason was the wish of the new owners for a re-branding, including a different name and the introduction of a new logo."]}, {"page": "John Leslie (rugby union)", "response": ["The Leslie brothers joined a line of New Zealanders to play for Scotland, dubbed the Kilted Kiwis, they include: Brendan Laney, Glenn Metcalfe, Gordon Simpson and Sean Lineen \u2013 the original Kilted Kiwi."]}, {"page": "Gregor Townsend", "response": ["In March 2012, Townsend stood down from his role with the national team and replaced Sean Lineen at Glasgow Warriors as their head coach."]}, {"page": "Scottish rugby commentators and journalists", "response": ["Bill Johnstone, nephew of Bill McLaren, leads the BBC Radio Scotland rugby commentary team on the Sportsound programme.

His drunk driving coincided with poor form for Glasgow and omission from the Scottish team. Glasgow Warriors ordered Parks to train alone while his future was considered.
