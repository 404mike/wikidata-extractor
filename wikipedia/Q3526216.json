Brown (English cricketer)", "response": ["Initially used primarily as an opening bowler for a county that had traditionally relied heavily on spin bowling, Brown took more than 100 wickets in both the 1959 and 1962 seasons and formed an effective new-ball partnership with the England Test player David Smith, used before the Test spin trio of David Allen, John Mortimore and Sam Cook were brought into action. Later in his career, his batting developed significantly, and he passed 1,000 runs in the 1964 season. He was also an excellent close fielder, and in 1966, playing for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, he held seven catches in an innings, equalling the world record for a fielder set in 1957 by Micky Stewart. In his first-class cricket career, he scored more than 12,000 runs and took more than 1,200 wickets, holding 493 catches."]}, {"page": "Ken Graveney", "response": ["In 1962, he reappeared in a few second eleven matches and, on the resignation as county captain of Tom Pugh at the end of that season Graveney was appointed to lead the county side in 1963 and 1964. With a talented side of bowling all-rounders, including the England players David Smith, John Mortimore and David Allen, Graveney bowled very little and at a very gentle medium pace and batted low down the order. The side finished eighth in 1963, but he retired as captain after a notably unsuccessful season in 1964 when Gloucestershire finished at the bottom of the County Championship."]}, {"page": "Francis McHugh", "response": ["McHugh's batting was consistently inept.

It was probably the liability of his batting that caused Gloucestershire to discard him in favour of David Smith for the 1957 season: McHugh had suffered from illness during 1956,Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 94th edition (1957); p. 364 and did not play after June, but had bowled so well in his last-ever game with eleven wickets for 112 runs that he was expected to continue in 1957."]}, {"page": "David Robert Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Smith (Gloucestershire cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| David Smith"]}, {"page": "David Pratt (cricketer)", "response": ["He stayed in the team throughout August, but took only eight more wickets in six games.

He returned to county cricket in 1962 with Nottinghamshire, playing seven first-class games (in which he took just four wickets) but otherwise being confined to the Second XI.
