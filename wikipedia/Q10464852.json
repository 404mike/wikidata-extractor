He played as an outside forward.\nFoxall was born in Sheffield. He played football for Roundel and Wombwell Town before joining Doncaster Rovers of the Second Division in 1902. The following year Foxall moved on to Gainsborough Trinity, also of the Second Division, where he spent four years, scoring League goals at a rate close to one every three games. This earned him a move to established First Division club Sheffield Wednesday, on the verge of winning the 1907 FA Cup Final. Foxall scored twice in what remained of the 1906\u201307 season, and over the next three years averaged 15 first-team games a season. In April 1910 he moved on to Birmingham, on the verge of having to apply for re-election. Birmingham experimented with Foxall at inside forward with little success, and he soon returned to the wing, but after a year with the club he moved on again, this time to Shrewsbury Town.On 12 November 1908, he was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm for \"maliciously assaulting\" a man from Sheffield two months prior. He was fined \u00a320 (equivalent to \u00a32,000 in 2019).He was married to Selena (or Selina) Green in 1903. He died in 1968 in Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
