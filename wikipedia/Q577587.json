During this time he entered open athletic meets and played for various English rugby teams including the Southampton Trojans, and from 1887 was a regular member of the London side Richmond. In 1885 Gould was invited to play for the newly formed Welsh exiles team London Welsh. London Scottish F.C. had been founded for Scottish players working or studying in the city, but until this time a London club for Welsh players had not existed. The side's first game, a trial match, was played on 21 October 1885 at Putney, and three days later the first team played London Scottish at the Saracens' Palmerston Road ground in Walthamstow. Gould played at half-back, and was joined in the team by Martyn Jordan, Thomas Judson, Rowley Thomas, Charles Taylor and T. Williams \u2013 all past or future Welsh internationals. During the 1885\u201386 season London Welsh were invited to form a combined \"exiles\" team with London Scottish, to face a London XV in a charity match at The Oval. Gould was one of six Welsh players selected to play in front of a crowd of 8,000 that included the Prince of Wales.", "Gould was first capped for Wales against England in the opening game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his preferred position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport teammate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales."]}, {"page": "Guy's, Kings and St Thomas' Rugby Football Club", "response": ["* \u2013 Martyn Jordan (1885\u20131889)"]}, {"page": "1902 in Wales", "response": ["*14 July \u2013 Martyn Jordan, Wales international rugby player, 37"]}, {"page": "1865 in Wales", "response": ["*7 March \u2014 Martyn Jordan, Wales international rugby player (died 1902)"]}, {"page": "1885 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Arthur Gould (Newport), Frank Hancock (Cardiff), Martyn Jordan (Newport), Charles Taylor (Ruabon), Charlie Newman (Newport) capt., William Gwynn (Swansea), Ernest Rowland (Lampeter), John Sidney Smith (Cardiff), Evan Richards (Swansea), Tom Clapp (Newport), Bob Gould (Newport), Horace Lyne (Newport), Thomas Baker Jones (Newport), Samuel Goldsworthy (Swansea), Lewis Thomas (Cardiff)", "Wales: Arthur Gould, Frank Hancock, Martyn Jordan, Charles Taylor, Charlie Newman capt., William Gwynn, Willie Thomas, Edward Alexander, Frank Hill, Tom Clapp, Bob Gould, D Morgan, Thomas Baker-Jones, Samuel Goldsworthy, Lewis Thomas"]}, {"page": "1889 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Hugh Hughes (Cardiff), Dickie Garrett (Penarth), James Webb (Newport), Edward Bishop (Swansea), Martyn Jordan (London Welsh), Charlie Thomas (Newport), Rosser Evans (Cardiff), Sydney Nicholls (Cardiff), Frank Hill (Cardiff) capt., William Williams (Cardiff), David William Evans (Cardiff), Theo Harding (Newport), Jim Hannan (Newport), Rowley Thomas (London Welsh), William Bowen (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "Charles Taylor (rugby union)", "response": ["In 1885, Taylor was spending much of his time in London, and when a group of Welshmen came together to form a club for London 'exiles', Taylor was among them.
