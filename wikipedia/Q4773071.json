He was imprisoned for murder for 18 years in Long Kesh, spending four of those years on the no-wash protest. After his release from prison in 1992 he completed a PhD in political science at Queens University Belfast and left the Republican Movement in 1998 to work as a journalist and researcher. A collection of his journalism was published as a book in 2008, Good Friday: The Death of Irish Republicanism.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Bew", "response": ["Bew was also involved in the project by Boston College to record interviews by former participants in the Irish \"Troubles\", including former republican and loyalist paramilitaries.

According to Keefe, Dolours Price told Ed Moloney and Anthony McIntyre that three IRA volunteers were present at McConville's killing: former Unknowns commander Pat McClure, Price and a third volunteer whom Price alleged fired the fatal shot. However, Moloney and McIntyre refused to tell Keefe who this person was, as the volunteer was still alive at the time. Nevertheless, Keefe claimed to have identified the IRA volunteer who pulled the trigger."]}, {"page": "Joe McDonnell (hunger striker)", "response": ["In March 2006, former prisoner Richard O'Rawe alleged that three days before McDonnell's death the British government made a firm offer to the prison leadership substantive enough to end the protest.

Former IRA prisoner and critic of Gerry Adams, Anthony McIntyre, has claimed that a more important British agent is operating in the organisation and that Donaldson was sacrificed by Sinn F\u00e9in to deceive people into thinking that the most serious infiltration had been ended.See The Telegraph report for 20 December 2005 available here."]}, {"page": "Dolours Price", "response": ["The Price sisters remained active politically.

Bowyer Bell", "response": ["Bell continued writing about the IRA and the ongoing events of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and in 1994 he was a speaker at West Belfast Festival, where he suggested the IRA was the only organisation in Northern Ireland that understood its problems. In 1996, he made headlines in Ireland and abroad after meeting with the Army Council of the dissident republican splinter group Continuity IRA at a secret rural location in Ireland. Former IRA member Anthony McIntyre claimed Bell had a pro-Irish republican bias, with McIntyre stating \"Bowyer Bell's long familiarity with Irish Republicanism once prompted the caustic comment that there are none more vindictive than a reformed gunman\". As well as releasing updated versions of The Secret Army, Bell continued to write about other aspects of the conflicts in Ireland and the Middle East. Cheating and Deception was published in 1991, The Irish Troubles: A Generation of Violence 1967-1992 in 1993, In Dubious Battle: The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings 1972-1974 and Back to the Future: The Protestants and a United Ireland in 1996, and Dynamics of the Armed Struggle in 1998. With the aid of a grant from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell returned to the Middle East in 2000 to conduct research for his next book, on Egyptian Islamic terrorism. As with The Secret Army first being published shortly after the start of the Troubles, Bell's timing was again good with Murders on the Nile: The World Trade Center and Global Terrorism being published in 2002, shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States by Al-Qaeda."]}, {"page": "McIntyre, Anthony", "response": ["#redirectAnthony McIntyre"]}, {"page": "Belfast Project", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anthony McIntyre#Research and the Belfast Project"]}]}}
