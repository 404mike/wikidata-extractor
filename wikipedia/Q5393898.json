The first was \"that the Royal Family is no longer a necessary party of the British constitution\", and the second was \"that the hereditary principle in the British Constitution be abolished\". George Lansbury responded that, although he too was a republican, he regarded the issue of the monarchy as a \"distraction\" from more important issues. Lansbury added that he believed the \"social revolution\" would eventually remove the monarchy peacefully in the future. Both of the motions were overwhelmingly defeated. Following this event, most of the Labour Party moved away from advocating republican views. In 1936, following the abdication of Edward VIII, MP James Maxton proposed a \"republican amendment\" to the Abdication Bill, which would have established a Republic in Britain. Maxton argued that while the monarchy had benefited Britain in the past, it had now \"outlived its usefulness\". Five MPs voted to support the bill, including Alfred Salter. However the bill was defeated by 403 votes."]}, {"page": "Harold Nicolson", "response": ["He became Parliamentary Secretary and official CensorAhmed Ali. Twilight in Delhi.
