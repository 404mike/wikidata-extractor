He was later educated at Loretto School in Scotland.Baxter was a highly enthusiastic cricket player for amateur teams, a fast bowler of in-swingers, a negligible tail-end batsman and a poor fielder. Despite being only an irregular first-class player, he took five wickets in an innings 16 times and four times went on to take 10 or more wickets in a match; in 1935 when he played seven first-class games, the most he ever achieved in a single season, he headed the English bowling averages for players bowling in 10 or more innings, with 42 wickets at 13.08. He toured Australia and New Zealand with the MCC in 1935\u201336. In a game for Lancashire against the touring West Indian side at Old Trafford in 1933, he took 5 for 10 runs in a 6 over spell.\nBaxter became secretary and director of the paper manufacturing company Spicers Ltd.", "link_mentions": {}}}
