After trying to associate themselves with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.) in search of establishing an authentic African Church, they ended up forming relations with the Anglican Church of the Province of Southern Africa, It was founded and initially led by James Mata Dwane. Dwane left the A.M.E church as he did not feel his episcopal status was valid, and thus along with the likes of M. Mpumlwane and Nehemiya Tile left the church. They sought talks with the Church of the Province and in 1900 a compact was signed by the seven bishops of the province to be in communion with the Ethiopian Church. This involved a decision to consecrate bishops, priest and deacons for the Order. Dwane was made a deacon in 1900, ordained as a priest in 1911 and he died in 1916 as the Provincial superior of the order a presidential title equal to that of an Anglican bishop."]}, {"page": "William Wellington Gqoba", "response": ["Gqoba attended the Mission School at Tyhume, followed by the Lovedale Institute.
