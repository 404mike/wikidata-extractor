Whereas the pit and foundry owners were initially men, many of whom had political ambitions, their wives sought more charitable activities often connected to improving the lives of the women and children of their husband's workers. In Dowlais, the heart of the ironworking industry of Wales, Rose Mary Crawshay, the well-to-do English-born wife of Robert Thompson Crawshay, passed her time in such charitable work. She set up soup kitchens, gave to the poor and established no less than seven libraries in the area, but apart from this work, for which she would be expected to do, she was also a staunch feminist.  Living under the rule of a notoriously tyrannical husband, for whom she bore five children, she showed a strong-will and was known in feminist circles in London from the 1850s. In 1866 she and 25 other signatories, all based in Wales, signed the country's first women's Suffrage Petition."]}, {"page": "Brecknockshire Agricultural Society", "response": ["The Society was established in March 1755, with the object and purpose of \"encouraging agriculture and local manufactures, and the promotion of the general good of the county.\" The first subscribing members to the Society were: Sir Edward Williams, of Gwernyfed; John Hughes; Hugh Penry; Charles David; John Phillips; William Morgan, clerk; Thomas Williams, clerk (then headmaster of Christ College); Marmaduke Gwynne; Edward Jeffreys; James Parry; Charles Lloyd; John Williams, clerk; Penry Williams, of Penpont; and Thomas Price Additional early members of the Society included Peregrine Thomas Bertie, Duke of Ancaster; Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester; Valentine Morris, of Piercefield; Thomas Bathurst, of Lydney; Dr. Linden; Sir Charles Hanbury Williams; Sir Charles Morgan; Viscount Hereford, of Tregoyd; several Earl Camdens; the late Lord Tredegar; Robert Thompson Crawshay of Cyfarthfa Castle; the Duke of Beaufort, the Right Hon.

It is generally believed to have been established in 1844, but a March 1840 invoice from instrument maker Charles Pace shows the purchase of three bugles, suggesting that the band was already being assembled. Trevor Herbert later dated the band's establishment to 1838, as mentioned in an obituary of R. T. Crawshay: as such, it is considered one of the first brass bands. The instruments obtained by Pace were expensive and imported from Vienna making them of a much higher quality than the British instruments made for the local market. Most players were believed to have loaned their instruments from Crawshay, paying him a rate of 5 shillings per month."]}, {"page": "George Bettesworth Piggott", "response": ["On 12 July 1904, Piggott married Amy Spiller, a granddaughter of ironmaster Robert Thompson Crawshay.
