Smith spent the majority of his career at Crewe Alexandra, playing in 399 League games and more than 400 overall.\nThe highlight of Smith's career came when he scored the winner for Crewe Alexandra in their 1-0 victory over Brentford in the 1997 Division Two play-off final. This took Crewe into the second tier of English football for the first time in around a century. He had also played in the 1993 Third division final at Wembley, which Crewe lost on penalties to York City. During the first division era Smith played mostly at left back for Crewe and was popular with the supporters despite never being a big star. He won the supporter's player of the year award in 2000\u201301. Smith eventually left Crewe in the summer of 2002 to join Hull City, where he scored once against Cambridge United, and a year later had two joint testimonial games (alongside fellow player Steve Macauley) at Crewe's Alexandra Stadium against Merseyside clubs Liverpool and Everton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shaun Smith", "response": ["Shaun Smith may refer to:", "*Shaun Smith (Australian footballer) (born 1969), Australian rules footballer", "*Shaun Smith (defensive lineman) (born 1981), American football player", "*Shaun Smith (linebacker) (born 1982), American football player ", "*Shaun Smith (English footballer) (born 1971), English footballer", "*Shaun Smith (make-up effects artist), American special effects artist"]}, {"page": "Steve Macauley", "response": ["He eventually retired from League football at the end of the 2003-04 season having had a joint testimonial with fellow former Alex defender Shaun Smith at Crewe's Alexandra Stadium in 2003 (the game was held over from the previous year).
