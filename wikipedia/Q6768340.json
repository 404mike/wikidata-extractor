The first match of the tournament was against England at the Neckarstadion, and Charlton reasoned that the threat posed by English wingers Chris Waddle and John Barnes could be nullified by allowing the English defence to feel comfortable on the ball without allowing them a pass; this made the build-up play slow and containable. His game-plan worked and Ireland claimed a 1\u20130 win after Ray Houghton secured an early lead. He then compensated for a series of injuries by playing Ronnie Whelan and Kevin Sheedy in central midfield, and was rewarded with a great performance and a good point in a 1\u20131 draw with the Soviet Union at the Niedersachsenstadion, Whelan scoring the goal. To qualify they only needed a point against the Netherlands at the Parkstadion, and Charlton devised a time-wasting plan with goalkeeper Packie Bonner that he was forced to abandon after referee Horst Brummeier was less than impressed. Ireland lost the game 1\u20130 after Wim Kieft scored an 82nd-minute goal. England and Ireland were eliminated while Netherlands and the Soviet Union qualified \u2013 both teams would go on to contest the final, which the Dutch won 2\u20130."]}, {"page": "List of people from Basingstoke", "response": ["* Mark Kelly, former professional footballer for Portsmouth and Republic of Ireland"]}, {"page": "Mark Kelly (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mark Kelly (born 1964) is an American astronaut and current U.S. Senator from Arizona.", "Mark Kelly may also refer to:", "* Mark Kelly (bassist) (born 1956), American bass guitarist of the band Petra", "* Mark Kelly (footballer, born 1966), English association football player", "* Mark Kelly (footballer, born 1969), English-born Irish association football player", "* Mark Kelly (general) (born 1956), Australian soldier", "* Mark Kelly (keyboardist) (born 1961), Irish-British musician of the band Marillion", "* Mark Kelly (hurler) (born 1988), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "Mark Kelly (Irish footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Kelly (footballer, born 1969)"]}]}}
