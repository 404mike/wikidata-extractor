Pearson is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium pace.  He was born at Stourbridge, Worcestershire.\nPearson made his debut for Herefordshire in the 1997 Minor Counties Championship against Dorset.  From 1997 to 2003, he represented the county in 43 Championship matches, the last of which came against Cornwall.  His MCCA Knockout Trophy debut for the county came against the Worcestershire Cricket Board in 1998.  From 1998 to 2003, he represented the county in 18 Trophy matches, the last of which came against Staffordshire.He also represented Herefordshire in List A cricket.  His debut List A match came against Wiltshire in the 1999 NatWest Trophy.  From 1999 to 2002, he represented the county in 8 List A matches, the last of which came against the Durham Cricket Board in the 2nd round of the 2003 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, which was played in 2002.

Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory.

This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists.Herbert, Christopher (2001). \"Karl Pearson and the Human Form Divine,\" in Victorian Relativity: Radical Thought and Scientific Discovery, Chicago University Press, pp. 145\u2013179. Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.", "thumb|right|280px|Karl Pearson at work, 1910.", "In The Myth of the Jewish RacePatai, Raphael, & Jennifer Patai (1989). The Myth of the Jewish Race. Wayne State University Press, p.\u00a0146.  Raphael and Jennifer Patai cite Karl Pearson's 1925 opposition (in the first issue of the journal Annals of Eugenics which he founded) to Jewish immigration into Britain. Pearson alleged that these immigrants \"will develop into a parasitic race. [...] Taken on the average, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population\".", "Karl Pearson was important in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, \"Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution\" established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelians favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.", "* Kikuchi Dairoku, a close friend and contemporary of Karl Pearson at University College School and Cambridge University", "Most of the biographical information above is taken from the Karl Pearson page at the Department of Statistical Sciences at University College London, which has been placed in the public domain.
