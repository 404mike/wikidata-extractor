Although he stayed and settled in Iran, he continued to be known as Hindi, indicating his stay in India, and Ruhollah Khomeini even used Hindi as a pen name in some of his ghazals.

Wali as passive designates one whose affairs are completely guided by God the exalted. Wali as active designates one who takes it on himself to worship God and obey him. On the other hand, some mystics, such as Najm-al-d\u012bn D\u0101ya, define welayah according to the concept of love and friendship. Also we can find out the other meaning for wali as \"closeness\" which means \"one who is close.\" A wali is an elected man among believers for the sake of his spiritual proximity to God Almighty. Also, walayah has a close relation to imamate; in other words there is inseparable linkage between imamiyyah (belief in the imamate) and walayah, which included five pillars such as love and devotion to the people of the household of the Prophet or Imams, following them in religion, obedience to their commands and abstention from what they prohibited, imitation of their actions and conduct, and recognition of their rights and belief in their imamate.  Wila of leadership or authority over religious matters, such a position needs Ismah and the speech and deed of the leader is an example for others as is regarded in verses 33:21, 3:31. and whatever he says is a divine proof.Imams or Awliya all make up the long chain of the Friends of God who carry and transmit the divine Covenant or welayah. According to  an esoteric interpretation, during the World of the Pact ('\u00e2lam* al-m\u00eeth\u00e2q) \u2014 a world with  the \"pure beings\" in the form of particles or shadows \u2014 we can see four oaths, including oaths of love and fidelity (wal\u00e2ya) toward Muhammad and his prophetic mission toward the Imams and their sacred Cause, and also toward the Mahdi as universal savior at the end of the world. Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi believes that it is the very term of welayah that denotes the ontological-theological status of the Imam. It is said that wal\u00e2ya has a quite simple translation along with two independent and complementary meanings. First it applies to the Imams of different prophets and also refers to  their ontological status or their sacred initiatory mission. The second meaning is the \"chief,\" the master of believers par excellence. In this interpretation, wal\u00ee is a synonym of was\u00ee, \"the inheritor\" or \"the heir.\" According to second meaning, walaya applied to the faithful of the Imams. It also denotes the unfailing love, faith, and submission that the initiated owe to their holy initiating guide. The Shia believe that every great prophet is accompanied by one or more Imams in his mission."]}, {"page": "Islam and Revolution", "response": ["The first volume covers the years 1941 to 1980, and  was compiled and translated from Persian by Hamid Algar.
