Characteristically, it incorporates influences from the bleak, noisy sound and aesthetics of early industrial music acts, particularly Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle. American industrial music label Wax Trax! also had a profound influence over the genre's development. The genre has seen a resurgence in the 2010s, spearheaded by acts such as Adam X, Orphx, and Ancient Methods, and others later like Blawan and Karenn. As a result, it has gained a significant fanbase from the post-dubstep audience. It is not to be mistaken with Techno Industrial, which is in essence similar to the power noise/rhythmic noise subgenre. The different terminology is used depending if one is coming from a techno perspective or industrial perspective, with Industrial Techno having more techno-inspired rhythmic section with many reverb and wall-of-noise or sci-fi effects, while Techno Industrial is closer to rhythmic noise in composition, with a distorted rhythmic section. Other artists associated with industrial techno include Cut Hands, Helena Hauff, Forward Strategy Group, Surgeon, Michael Forshaw, Jeff Mills, Regis, Dominick Fernow and Mike Banks.

It is most commonly associated with the city's House of God club night, the Downwards Records label, and the local DJs and producers Regis, Surgeon and Female.

Most closely identified with the city's Downwards Records label and its local producers Regis, Surgeon and Female, Birmingham techno's characteristic hard, fast and uncompromising style was influenced as much by the local industrial music scene that developed around Mick Harris of Napalm Death and Martyn Bates of Eyeless in Gaza as it was by the pioneers of American techno. Downwards would become one of the most important labels in world techno, and the \"darkly reductionist\" influence of its \"huge slabs of unrelentingly unchanging minimalism\" would be unmistakable in the development of the later techno scenes in New York City and at the Berghain in Berlin.", "In 2002 Regis went on to form Sandwell District, initially a label and later an international production collective that included the New York-based Function and the Los Angeles-based Silent Servant, both of whom would briefly relocate to Birmingham. Sandwell District's sound built upon the minimalism that the earlier Birmingham sound had established as the dominant techno aesthetic of the early 2000s, but also challenged it, being characterised by a greater degree of subtlety and refinement and showing influences from wider musical genres including post-punk, shoegaze and death rock. Sandwell District would in turn to create a major shift in world techno and influence another generation of techno musicians.
