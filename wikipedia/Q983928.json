Boston 2014, p. 325; http://www.huisongshu.com/ming.htm (site in Chinese).

Early in his reign, in 1600\u201301, he had to cope with a threatening invasion of Tibet by the Mongol khan Khatan; he was eventually able to expel Khatan's army from Yangpachen, the estate of his ally the Shamarpa lama.James Gentry, 2013, p. 139. However, he also strengthened the ties to some Mongols that his father had initiated. According to one version he was married to Sonam Palgyi Butri, a daughter of the Kyish\u00f6 lord in the Lhasa area. She gave birth to a daughter but the couple subsequently separated. Sonam Palgyi Butri then married Tenpai Nyima, of the abbot family of Ralung, and gave birth to Ngawang Namgyal (1594\u20131651?), the founder of Bhutan.Michael Aris, Bhutan. The Early History of a Himalayan Kingdom, Warminster 1979, p. 205. All this may explain part of the hostility between the Tsangpa and Ngawang Namgyal later on. Karma Tensung's reign saw considerable territorial expansion of Tsangpa power. Four large regions of southern Tibet were subdued, as well as territories in western and northern Tibet. At this time there was no central authority in \u00dc, since the Gelugpa were still not a governing power. The Gelugpa head at the time was the Fourth Dalai Lama Yonten Gyatso (1589\u20131616), a Mongol prince. He arrived to Tibet in 1602, but conflicts soon flared up with the Red Hat sub-sect of the Karmapa. As the protector of the Red Hats, Karma Tensung invaded \u00dc in 1604 and seized Phanyul. In 1605 his Tsangpa troops turned against the Gelugpa and defeated his former in-laws of Kyish\u00f6. Some 5,000 monks and laymen are said to have been massacred on the hills behind the monasteries Drepung and Sera.Ya Hanzhang, Biographies of the Tibetan Spiritual Leaders Panchen Erdenis, Beijing 1994, p. 26."]}, {"page": "Karma Phuntsok Namgyal", "response": ["The family background of Karma Phuntsok Namgyal is somewhat unclear. According to a religious biography, he was the son of Karma Thutob Namgyal, ruler of Upper Tsang, and a lady from Yargyab.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls, 1949, Vol. II, p. 697. His mother was from the Yargyab and said to be called P\u00f6nsa Yargyabma and this information can be seen in Shakabpa 2010, p. 309, but other sources (such as Tucci, TPS/1949, p. 53; Tuttle & Schaeffer, 287, 289-290; Fifth Dalai Lama\u2019s biography of the Fourth, 38b) say that P\u00f6nsa Yargyabma was the queen of Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, not his mother; and that she was the mother of the last Tsangpa ruler, Karma Tenkyong Wangpo. Needs more research and clarification. Other sources make him the son of either of the rulers Karma Tseten or Karma Tensung.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, One Hundred Thousand Moons, Leiden 2010, p. 283. The law code issued by his son Karma Tenkyong vaguely says that Karma Thutob Namgyal and his brothers had Karma Phuntsok Namgyal as their son, suggesting the Tibetan practice of polyandry. The same text asserts that he was 25 years old in 1611, which in the Tibetan system would indicate 1587 as his year of birth.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, p. 697. Another source makes him 16 or 17 years old in 1614, which is unlikely since his son Karma Tenkyong was born in 1606; see Michael Aris, Bhutan. The Early History of a Himalayan Kingdom, Warminster 1979, p. 208. According to some texts his predecessor Karma Tensung died in the iron-pig year 1611. However, another source mentions Karma Phuntsok Namgyal as a Tsangpa leader by 1603.Hugh E. Richardson, Tibet and its History, Boston & London 1984, Appendix, chronological table, p. 307. As such he would have directed the military attack into \u00dc (East Central Tibet) in 1605.Fa-tsun, 'Blo-bzang-chos-kyi', Encyclopaedia of Buddhism. Volume III. Colombo 1971, p. 168: \"In 1603 Karma Phun-tshogs snam-rgyal and his son and Shwa-dmar Ngag-dbang chos-grags in Gtsang became hostile to the Yellow Sect. In 1605 Karma Phun-tshogs snam-rgyal sent his troops to Dbus, demolished the castle of Skyi-shod and killed many Tibetan officials\". According to still another text his first major feat was an incident in 1607 when he led his troops in an attack that dispersed a Mongol force that had been called in by the lord of Kyish\u00f6 near Lhasa.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 698. At his accession he held control over the bulk of Tsang, Toh in western Tibet, and some parts of \u00dc.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History, Yale 1967, pp. 90, 98. In 1612\u201313 he led an expedition to Ngari (West Tibet), where Mangy\u00fcl Gungthang was subjugated. Lat\u00f6 Lho and Lat\u00f6 Chang (in western Tsang) suffered the same fate.Karl-Heinz Everding & Dawa Dargyay Dzongphugpa, Das tibetische F\u00fcrstentum La stod lHo (um 1265-1642), Wiesbaden 2006, p. 113. The agility of Karma Phuntsok Namgyal was demonstrated by his swift turn from the western campaign to invade \u00dc in the east in 1613. The troops from Tsang resolutely worsted the Phagmodrupa king Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo who created trouble in the Yarlung Valley.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet, Vol. I-II. Wien 2013, pp. 311\u20132. After these feats the writ of the king of Tsang ran all the way from Lat\u00f6 and Nyangt\u00f6 in the west to \u00dc in the east. Among the new acquisitions were Lopa (south of \u00dc), Dagpo (in the far south-east), Phanyul (to the north of Lhasa), and Neu (south-east of Lhasa).David Templeman, Becoming Indian: A study of the life of the 16th-17th century Tibetan Lama Taranatha. PhD Thesis, Monash University 2008. The new dependencies were nevertheless far from secured, and he had to take up arms from time to time.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 698.", "Meanwhile, a fateful conflict flared up with Ngawang Namgyal (1594\u20131651?), a grandson of the prince-abbot of the Ralung monastery. This person was considered  to be the main reincarnation of the well-known religious Drukpa scholar Kunkhyen Pema Karpo (1527\u201392). However, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal refused to acknowledge the claim, which had to do with an internal Drukpa dispute. Ngawang Namgyal's recognition and enthronement at Ralung as the Gyalwang Drukpa incarnation was, namely, opposed by Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo, an influential follower of Drukpa Pema Karpo. He instead promoted the recognition of a rival candidate as the right incarnation. This was Pagsam Wangpo who was an illegitimate son of the Chongje Depa, Ngawang Sonam Drakpa. Lhatsewa and the supporters of the Chongje Depa conducted an enthronement ceremony of Pagsam Wangpo at the Tashi Thongmen monastery, where he was thus appointed as the new Gyalwang Drukpa and the putative incarnation of Kunkhyen Pema Karpo. The Chongje Depa then persuaded the Tsang Desi (or Depa Tsangpa), being the patron of the rival Karma Kagyu sect, to support the recognition of Pagsam Wangpo. By 1612 Karma Phuntsok Namgyal had become the major political force in Central Tibet (\u00dc and Tsang) and his words carried great weight. A meeting between the king and Ngawang Namgyal was arranged in the Tsang capital Shigatse in 1614, but the cleric held a disrespectful attitude, and the conversations with the king led to nothing. On Ngawang Namgyal's return to Ralung an incident occurred where his men had a fight with a Karmapa lama and his followers, whereby some people were drowned. Karma Phuntsok Namgyal resolved to have Ngawang Namgyal killed, but the latter fled to Bhutan in 1616. There he built up a position of authority. After some time the Tsangpa king sent a force under Lagunas to invade Bhutan. The expedition captured Padro but was subsequently defeated by Ngawang Namgyal's followers, and Lagunas was killed.Michael Aris, 1979, p. 208-12"]}, {"page": "Karma Tenkyong", "response": ["Meanwhile, there were a few disputes with areas to the west and south.

In 1634 he sent six columns that attacked Bhutan across various points of the border from Padro to Bumthang. The Tsangpa forces were able to capture the Sinmodokha palace. They demanded hostages from Ngawang Namgyal, who however gave a defiant reply. The Tibetan soldiers who had captured the palace were supposedly killed by a gunpowder explosion, and the invasion at length achieved nothing (see also Battle of Five Lamas).Michael Aris, Bhutan. The early History of a Himalayan Kingdom, Warminster 1979, p. 219. In 1638 a chief of the Chahar tribe of the Mongols performed a raid from Tibet into Ladakh but were repulsed by king Sengge Namgyal. Due to this there arose some tension between the Tsangpa and Ladakh, although it did not come to open warfare. The Tsang elite sent envoys to pay their respects to Sengge Namgyal. While he marched back with his army, the Ladakhi king subjugated a number of monastic fiefs and herdsmen communities in western Tibet.Luciano Petech, The Kingdom of Ladakh, C. 950-1842 A.D., Rome 1977, pp. 46\u201347."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Bhutanese history", "response": ["| 747 || || Buddhist saint Padmasambhava, known as \"Guru Rimpoche\", comes to Bhutan from India at the invitation of Sindhu Raja of the Kingdom of Bumthang, one of the numerous kingdoms predating modern Bhutan.
