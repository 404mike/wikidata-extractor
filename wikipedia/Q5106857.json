Vale narrowly beat Notts County and Chester City to give themselves some breathing space. On 18 January, Rudge agreed to sign a new two-year contract. However Vale began to struggle, as Bury and Cardiff City inflicted two straight losses. Yet a back injury forced Bob Hazell into retirement, whilst Ray Walker had trouble with his foot. More bad news came when loyal servant Phil Sproson retired on medical advice after sustaining a bad knee injury.  Rudge responded by trying to bolster his defence, but was unable to secure Steve Sims, Peter Swan, Simon Morgan, Chris Hemming, or Peter Skipper. Rudge then took the decision to sign classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000, as a replacement for Sproson. This more than quadrupled the club's previous transfer record. Andy Jones also agreed to join the club on loan to boost the club's promotion chances."]}]}}
