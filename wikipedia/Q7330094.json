The house was viewed and accepted, and a lease contract was signed on 19 August 1901. A former monastic site, the construction of the house had been begun in 1701 by Sir Robert Worsley on the site of a Tudor manor house and completed much later (1773) by Sir Richard Worsley who, from 1787, also established there what was to become a well-known art collection. On the death of Sir Richard in 1805, the estate passed to his niece, who was married to the Second Baron and first Earl of Yarborough. The family connection with the house ended in 1855, when the estate was sold off by her son, the Second Earl of Yarborough."]}, {"page": "Worsley (surname)", "response": ["* Richard Worsley (1923\u20132013), English general"]}, {"page": "Quartermaster-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1979\u20131982 General Sir Richard Worsley"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bonchurch", "response": ["During the Hundred Years War, society had become militarised:  male adults were obliged to fight if needed, and they received regular military training. The Captain of the Isle, Sir Richard Worsley of Appuldurcombe House, was considered a \"capable and energetic commander\".  He was assisted by Sir Edward Bellingham, an officer in the regular army, and a headquarters staff.  Compared to the heavily armoured French troops, bristling with the latest firearms and steel blades, the militia relied on long pikes topped with a bill hook, and daggers, knives, and clubs for close fighting. The Welsh longbow provided their firepower.

In 1199 Stephen son of Odo conveyed 20 acres of land in Nunwell to Ralph son of Nigel, and in 1286 John de Tracy and his wife Benedicta exchanged land in Nunwell for land in Holton with William de Houton. The statement of Sir Richard Worsley that the Oglander family had been seated at Nunwell ever since the Conquest is difficult to substantiate, but Roger Oglander was possibly holding the manor at the beginning of the 13th century when land at Nunwell was given by his servant Geoffrey Escoutard to Carisbrooke Priory, and his grandson Roger recovered 2 acres in Nunwell from Gilbert Abbot of Lire in 1256. It is not, however, till the end of the century that we are on firm ground; Henry Oglander then held Nunwell of the honour of Carisbrooke Castle. He died about 1310, and his son and successor Robert died in 1344, leaving as his heir his son Reginald, who had married Roberta the daughter of Robert Urry. Reginald held in 1346 with his coparceners three parts of a fee in Nunwell, representing what in later years came to be termed West Nunwell.   He died in 1349, leaving a son Robert, and livery of the manor was made to his widow Roberta in that year. Robert died without issue and his brother John succeeded to the manor. Reginald Oglander, who held the manor in 1428, is given as John's brother in a pedigree printed by Berry, but the pedigree is clearly wrong at this date."]}, {"page": "Milton Manor", "response": ["In the 15th century the manor seems to have been split up into East and West Milton. East Middleton, the Hakets' portion of the manor, passed with Wolverton, with which it evidently became merged, as the joint holding was known as Wolverton alias Milton from the end of the 16th century onwards. West Milton apparently passed with East Standen to Joan Cooke, who leased it in 1514 to William Howles. The lease, and apparently later the tenancy, of the manor came like East Standen into the hands of the Meux and Bannister families, and in 1573 William Meux sold two parts of West Milton to John Worsley of Appuldurcombe, the remaining third being sold by Sir Edward Bannister in 1616 to Sir Richard Worsley. West Milton thus became united with East Milton, and subsequently followed its descent."]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir Richard Worsley"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sir Richard Worsley, 89, army general."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2013", "response": ["*Sir Richard Worsley, 89, British Army general.\"Richard Worsley\", The Times (London), 27 February 2013"]}, {"page": "1982 New Year Honours", "response": ["* General Sir Richard Worsley, , (240132), late The Royal Dragoons (1st Dragoons)."]}, {"page": "Henry Worsley (explorer)", "response": ["Henry Worsley was born on 4 October 1960 at the Garrett Anderson Maternity Home in Belsize Grove, London.The Times 5 October 1960, p.1  He was the only son of General Sir Richard Worsley GCB OBE (1923\u20132013) and his first wife, Sarah Anne \"Sally\", eldest daughter of Brigadier J.
