However, when the second phase (Operation Georgette, or the Battle of the Lys) began on 9 April, it soon began to put pressure on the southern part of the Ypres Salient. Brigade groups from 49th Division were sent south to support other British formations. On 11 April it was the turn of 146th Bde, which moved to the slopes of Mont Kemmel, eventually coming under the command of the 28th French Division. In the early hours of 25 April this position was heavily bombarded with smoke and gas shells, followed at 05.00 by an infantry attack shielded by morning mist. At 06.45, a company of 1/6th Bn was reported to be fighting a rearguard action under Captain George Sanders (who had won a VC as a Corporal with 1/7th Bn at Thiepval in 1916). Sanders was seen rallying his men from the top of a pillbox and firing into the enemy with his revolver before he fell. (Wounded and taken prisoner, he was later awarded the Military Cross (MC) to go with his VC.) The frontline companies having been overrun, the rest of the brigade fell back through Vierstraat Cross to Ouerdom, where the enemy advance was halted. In two days' fighting (25\u201326 April) the 6th Bn lost 22 officers and  461 other ranks. At Ouerdom on 27 April, the remnants of the brigade were temporarily formed into a composite battalion under the command of Major R. Clough of 6th Bn and placed in divisional reserve.Magnus, pp. 94, 184\u201391.Middlebrook, p. 224, Appendix 4."]}]}}
