The artists were fascinated by the fishermen's working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the community's life, such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out, or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster. Walter Langley is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and Stanhope Forbes, who settled there in 1884, as the father of it. The later Forbes School of Painting, founded by Forbes and his wife Elizabeth in 1899, promoted the study of figure painting. A present-day Newlyn School of Art was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today.", "*Walter Langley"]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Walter Langley (1852\u20131922)"]}, {"page": "1882 in art", "response": ["* Walter Langley moves to Newlyn on the coast of Cornwall, becoming the first resident artist of the Newlyn School."]}, {"page": "Henry Scott Tuke", "response": ["In 1883, Tuke returned to Britain and moved to Newlyn, Cornwall joining a small colony of artists including Walter Langley, Albert Chevallier Tayler and Thomas Cooper Gotch.

Its most important figure was David Cox, whose later works make him an important precursor of impressionism. The influence of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and the Birmingham School of Art made Birmingham an important centre of Victorian art, particularly within the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts and Crafts movements. Major figures included the Pre-Raphaelite and symbolist Edward Burne-Jones; Walter Langley, the first of the Newlyn School painters; and Joseph Southall, leader of the group of artists and craftsmen known as the Birmingham Group."]}, {"page": "Warrington Museum & Art Gallery", "response": ["The museum's collection was originally based upon the collection of the Warrington Natural History Society but it has since grown and now includes a wide range of subjects such as ethnology, egyptology, geology, Roman Britain, pottery/ceramics, botany, fish, amphibians, reptiles, the Civil War, local industries, birds and mammals, and glass.Warrington Museum & Art Gallery - Collections, accessed 11\u00a0July 2012 The building also houses a collection of around 1,000 paintings, (oils, watercolours and prints) from the 19th and early 20th centuries, many of which are on display in the mezzanine Art Gallery on the 2nd floor. One of the most famous works in the collection is Between The Tides (1901) by Walter Langley, acquired in 1966.

David Cox originally trained as a painter of theatrical scenery; Walter Langley and David Bomberg were both lithographers; the artists of the Birmingham Group practiced metalwork, book illustration and stained glass manufacture as well as painting; while backgrounds in advertising and commercial graphic design were key influences on the surrealism of Conroy Maddox and the pop art of Peter Phillips.", "The most prominent members of a generation of young painters from the School of Art were elected as the Society of Artists' first associates in the 1860s, including Walter Langley, William Wainwright, Frank Bramley and Edwin Harris. Of these the most significant was Langley, whose move to the Cornish fishing village of Newlyn in 1882 made him the first of the Newlyn School of plein air painters. Although he was later joined by Harris, Bramley, Wainwright and numerous London artists including Stanhope Forbes, Langley's work remained vital to the image of the Newlyn School and was matched only by that of Forbes for substance and consistency. His watercolour In faith and hope the world will disagree. But all mankind's concern is charity was singled out as \"a beautiful and true work of art\" by Leo Tolstoy in his book What is Art? and in 1895 Langley was invited by the Uffizi in Florence to contribute a self portrait to hang alongside those of Raphael, Rubens and Rembrandt in their collection of portraits of great artists."]}, {"page": "Three Fishers", "response": ["The song was quite popular during much of the Victorian era. In 1883, English painter Walter Langley created \"For Men Must Work and Women Must Weep\", a watercolour painting based on Kingsley's poem.Watercolour - But Men Must Work and Women Must Weep at the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery web site The song (as arranged by Hullah) was a frequently sung by popular vocalists such as Antoinette Sterling and Charlotte Sainton-Dolby, each of whom gave distinctly different interpretations. Sterling once explained: \"Although I had never been to sea in a storm, and had never even seen fishermen, I somehow understood that song of ' The Three Fishers' by instinct. On reading the poem over for the first time no one could know from the opening that the men would necessarily be drowned. Therefore it was a story. But there is a natural tendency to anticipate an unhappy ending; hence it was customary to begin the song so mournfully that everybody realised from the very start what the end was going to be. Madame Sainton-Dolby, for instance, used to sing it sorrowfully from the first note to the last. I had never seen or known of anyone who was drowned, but that mysterious instinct was so strong that I could not foreshadow the finish. When, therefore, I started, I always made the first verse quite bright. I must believe it was the true way, since both the poet and composer endorsed my rendering of it.\"Harold Simpson, A Century Of Ballads 1810-1910, Their Composers & Singers, Mills & Boon, Limited London, Circa 1911 According to a text by Harold Simpson, when Sterling finished performing the song at her London debut, \"there was a tumult of applause ; people rose in their places and cheered, waving hats and handkerchiefs in their excitement.\""]}, {"page": "Langley (surname)", "response": ["*Walter Langley (1852\u20131922), English artist"]}, {"page": "William John Wainwright", "response": ["Wainwright trained at the Birmingham School of Art under the headship of Edward R.
