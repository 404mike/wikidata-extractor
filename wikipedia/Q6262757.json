His work has moved from early plunderphonic compositions \u2013 where he brought together unlikely combinations of musical genres to create fantastical new works \u2013 to large scale works composed of thousands of tiny fragments which create the impression of virtual orchestras. Critics have remarked on \"his extraordinary feeling for musical narrative\" which is achieved through a working method that has been described as \"phenomenally painstaking\". According to one critic, Wall's \"releases sound like the most finely crafted audio sculptures, somewhere between the contemporary composition of Lachenmann and the experiments of early laptop musicians of the mid 90s.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gold Teeth Thief", "response": ["#\"Rude Ass Tinker U Can't Touch This (Planet Mu), DJ /rupture feat.
