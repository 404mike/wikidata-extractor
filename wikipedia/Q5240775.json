Barron then played 37 competitive matches for Burnley in the 1905\u201306 season, scoring once. Following the arrival of half-back Rupert Cawthorne from Clitheroe before the 1906\u201307 campaign, Barron began to play at right-fullback. For the fourth time in his Burnley career, he played in every Second Division game during the campaign. His 300th Football League appearance came in the final match of the season, a 1\u20131 draw with Glossop at Turf Moor.Simpson (2007), p. 105"]}, {"page": "Walders, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Walders"]}]}}
