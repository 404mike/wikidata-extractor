He waited until 8 February but just after leaving, he received a wireless message asking him to turn back as Mawson had reached the base. He turned Aurora around but severe weather prevented the landing boat being put ashore, so, on the evening of 9 February, Davis decided he must steam west to fetch the western base party.

B. E. S. Ninnis accompanied the 1911\u201314 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, under Douglas Mawson, as a dog handler. Along with Mawson and Xavier Mertz, he formed the Far Eastern Party, using sledge dogs to explore the area around the expedition's base in Ad\u00e9lie Land.Ayres (1999), p. 69 On 14 December 1912, B.
