The tazza was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Walter Leo Hildburgh in 1956, after being displayed on loan there since 1937.  The bowl was traditionally thought to show Domitian but has recently been re-identified as Tiberius; it is now associated with the figurine of Domitian, but until 1956 with the figurine of Vitellius.  The Vitellius figurine was removed in 1956 and transferred as part of a three-way swap: the figurine of Vitellius was sent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Metropolitan Museum sent its figurine of Otho to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and the figurine of Domitian from Toronto was sent to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  The attempt to correct the mismatches reunited the Vitellius and Otho bowls in New York and Toronto with the correct figurines, and was intended to reunite Domitian too, but inadvertently created a new mismatch in London.Tiberius tazza,  Metropolitan Museum of Art", "** The Vitellius tazza (bowl and figurine, but with replaced decorated base) is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (previously with the figurine of Otho, send to the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto in 1956).Vitellius tazza, Metropolitan Museum of Art  It was owned by Dr. Walter Leo Hildburgh, and then Jules S.
