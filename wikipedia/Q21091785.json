However, British diplomats residing there have sought refuge in a fortified compound south-west of the city to avoid the repetitive rocket attacks by warring militias. Three days earlier, a convoy carrying British diplomats from Tripoli to Tunisia came under fire when their vehicles refused to stop at an unofficial checkpoint in the outskirts of the city. On 2 August, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office finally announced that it would temporarily close its embassy in the capital and evacuate its staff. Ambassador Michael Aron said that the embassy would continue to operate from Tunisia. The following day, the Royal Navy ship HMS Enterprise managed to evacuate more than a hundred foreign nationals from the country to Malta, most of whom were British, in an operation off the coast of Tripoli. In March 2016, Ambassador Peter Millett called for \"a much more coordinated approach between the different groups, regions and forces and the armed groups in Libya\" in order to defeat ISIL in Libya. Head of British Embassy in Libya, Nicholas Hopton said that Britain is drafting a resolution in the Security Council in order to genuinely end the Libyan crisis. The draft resolution urges the U.N. and the international community to effectively achieve a ceasefire with the help of a monitoring mission and other sources, the HCS Information Office said."]}, {"page": "Mohamed Eshtewi", "response": ["Peter Millett, the British Ambassador to Libya, tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the \"senseless murder.\" The Italian embassy in Tripoli released a statement echoing Millett's sentiments. The French Foreign Ministry called the murder a \"cowardly act\" that indicated an urgent need for a political solution to the current crisis. The Turkish foreign ministry described the \"heinous assassination\" as an attempt to destabilize Misurata and Libya. United Nations envoy to Libya Ghassan Salam\u00e9 condemned the killing, calling Eshtewi a contributor to peace in Misurata and Libya."]}]}}
