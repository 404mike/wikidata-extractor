He was commonly known by the name Matthew J. Watkins to avoid confusion with another Welsh rugby union player of the same name.\nBorn in Newport, Watkins began his rugby career with Newbridge and Pontllanfraith before going professional with Newport in 1997. After scoring 35 tries (175 points) in 121 appearances over five seasons with the club, Watkins was signed by Llanelli. He was then part of the team at the dawn of regional rugby in Wales in 2003 and was part of the original Llanelli Scarlets regional side.\nBy 2007, he had become only the third player to reach 100 appearances for the region, following lock Adam Jones and prop John Davies. Watkins signed for Gloucester at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, midway through a three-year contract with the Scarlets.On 3 August 2009, it was confirmed that Watkins would return to Wales and to the place where his professional rugby career began, signing for Newport Gwent Dragons on a two-year contract. He was released at the end of the 2010\u201311 season and retired soon after.\nOn 20 May 2013, it was announced that Watkins had developed a very rare pelvic cancer while studying for rugby coaching qualifications, but described himself as remaining \"well and active.\" On 7 March 2020, it was announced that Watkins had died at the age of 41.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005\u201306 Powergen Cup", "response": ["|OC ||13|| Matthew Watkins"]}, {"page": "Watkins (surname)", "response": ["* Matthew Watkins (1978\u20132020), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1978 in Wales", "response": ["*2 September - Matthew Watkins, rugby union player (died 2020)"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Llanelli Scarlets season", "response": ["Welsh internationals Dwayne Peel, Alix Popham and Matthew Watkins also agreed deals to move away from Stradey Park at the end of the season, while Mahonri Schwalger was signed on a short-term contract mid-season to cover for the injured Ken Owens.

Against the Dragons, he crossed the line for a try after being played in by Jonathan Davies, but the ball was knocked from his grasp in a try-saving tackle from former Scarlet Matthew Watkins before it could be grounded. It took Fenby until 5 March 2010 to score his first Magners League try, crossing in a 25\u20138 win over Ulster; in the third minute, Joe Ajuwa broke down the right wing, but he was brought down just short of the line. Scrum-half Tavis Knoyle spread the ball wide left to Rhys Priestland, and it was then a matter of putting the ball through the hands to provide Fenby with a simple run-in for the try. He scored again against Edinburgh three weeks later; after playing a part in his team's first try, with 10 minutes left to play, Fenby beat four Edinburgh defenders to claim a losing bonus point for the Scarlets. As a reward for his successful first season with the Scarlets, Fenby was given a new two-year contract with the region on 23 April 2010."]}, {"page": "2006 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Matthew Watkins"]}, {"page": "Matt Watkins", "response": ["Matthew Watkins (born November 22, 1986) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played a single game with the Phoenix Coyotes in the National Hockey League (NHL).
