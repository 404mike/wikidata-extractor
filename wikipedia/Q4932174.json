He was also a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). A self-described \"communist/socialist\", he was a leading figure in the No to EU \u2013 Yes to Democracy campaign.\nCrow joined London Transport in 1977 and soon became involved in trade unionism. He was regarded as part of the Awkward Squad, a loose grouping of left-wing union leaders who came to power in a series of electoral victories beginning in 2002. After he became leader, the RMT's membership increased from around 57,000 in 2002 to more than 80,000 in 2008, making it one of Britain's fastest-growing trade unions.Crow was a polarising figure in British politics. Supporters praised him as a champion of the working class and a successful trade unionist; critics argued that he held London to ransom with strikes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Awkward squad", "response": ["The tag of 'awkward squad' has been applied to a group of left-wing trade unionists in the United Kingdom, marked out by their opposition to the Labour Party's economic policies.  The group includes Bob Crow, Mark Serwotka, and Tony Woodley. In a Parliamentary sense, however, it can also apply to the left-wing of the Labour Party, which perennially occupies a bench of the House of Commons which allows its members to heckle and unnerve the Prime Minister regularly."]}, {"page": "Tommy Sheridan", "response": ["Sheridan stood as a candidate in the 2009 European Parliament elections for No to EU \u2013 Yes to Democracy, a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition led by RMT union leader Bob Crow.Mark Smith \"Exclusive: Tommy Sheridan to stand for Euro elections\", Daily Record, 10 March 2009\"No To EU \u2013 RMT launches election campaign\", Socialist Worker, 24 March 2009", "A \"Defend Tommy Sheridan\" campaign was launched by sympathetic trade unionists and politicians to demand why Sheridan was being investigated. In December 2007, Sunday Herald columnist Iain MacWhirter said it was \"hard not to conclude that the police's diligence has been inspired by Rupert Murdoch's News International.\" The campaign drew support from the politician George Galloway and leading trade unionist Bob Crow (RMT). At a June 2008 rally organised by the campaign, speakers including FBU secretary Kenny Ross, Paddy Hill, and Gerry Conlon queried the motives for the investigation, questioned the role of the police and Crown Office and verbally attacked the witnesses who had given evidence unhelpful to Sheridan in the original hearing."]}, {"page": "Shadwell", "response": ["* Bob Crow (13 June 1961 \u2013 11 March 2014) \u2013 trade union leader"]}]}}
