He enjoyed loan spells out at Macclesfield Town, Walsall, Rochdale, and Hartlepool United, before signing a contract with Barnsley in March 2004. A key player at the club, he helped the \"Tykes\" to promotion out of the League One play-offs in 2006. He left the club after Barnsley withdrew their offer of a contract, and subsequently signed with Tranmere Rovers. He played 144 games for Rovers in league and cup competitions, before transferring to Morecambe for the 2010\u201311 season. He joined Port Vale on non-contract terms in February 2012, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He retired in May 2014 due to a chronic knee injury, but, having rejoined Tranmere Rovers as a coach in October 2014, returned to playing two months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["|2005|| Chris Shuker"]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["His team exited the three cup competitions at the First Round in 2011\u201312, and after losing to non-league Grimsby Town in the FA Cup in a run of five games without a win \u2013 which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal \u2013 he signed Guy Madjo, Jennison Myrie-Williams and Shane O'Connor on loan. These proved to be inspired signings, as a Madjo hat-trick meant that the two Stevenage loanees scored a total of five goals between them in their first three games. However, in December he admitted that the club's off-the-field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being \"kept very much in the dark.\" Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window \u2013 despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets. He did though manage to sign Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall on non-contract terms. He would also have signed Chris Birchall, however before the deal was finalised the Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid. The club were unable to pay the player's wages in February. The club entered administration on 9 March, ending what had been a genuine push for promotion; talks between the administrator and Adams did not seem constructive, as Adams told the press that he was \"taking legal advice\". However, he stayed put, and steered the \"Valiants\" to a 12th-place finish; they would have been only 3 points off the play-offs had the club not entered administration. In May, he was linked with the vacant management position at Gillingham, with his friendship with \"Gills\" chairman Paul Scally cited in his favour in media reports.", "In October 2014, Adams was appointed manager of Tranmere Rovers, who at the time were bottom of the Football League. After overseeing an upturn of results that saw the club move eight points above bottom-place Hartlepool United he was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award in December, with the judges saying that he \"has instilled a calm belief at Prenton Park that has won over players, supporters and directors alike\". In the January transfer window he signed a number of players who had played for him at Port Vale, including Jennison Myrie-Williams (on loan), Steve Jennings, Rob Taylor and Lee Molyneux; these players joined Chris Shuker, who Adams had signed in October to work as a player-coach (Guy Madjo also had a brief spell at the club over Christmas). He left his position as manager of Tranmere Rovers by mutual consent on 19 April, with the club still bottom of the Football League with two games left to play of the 2014\u201315 season."]}, {"page": "Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["He signed for John Rudge's Port Vale in June 1998 for a fee of \u00a3100,000. He played 19 First Division games in 1998\u201399. He featured just 14 times in 1999\u20132000. Walsh made 48 appearances in 2000\u201301, and went on to receive his only honour at the club in 2001, as he helped Vale to beat Brentford 2\u20131 in the Football League Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium. However his injury saga began not long after signing a new contract under Brian Horton in 2001 when Walsh underwent surgery, but by the end of the year he seemed to have recovered. However, by June 2003 another operation was needed to correct a shoulder injury. After this latest procedure he picked up an abdominal strain, though he again slowly began to recover. By November of that year he was injured again, this time because of his back, he required a series of injections and again consulted a surgeon. By February 2004 he was on the road to recovery, but the next month picked up a neck injury in a collision with Barnsley's Chris Shuker, meaning another operation."]}, {"page": "Darren Murphy", "response": ["Murphy signed for League Two club Port Vale on a free transfer on 2 July 2012, signing a one-year contract. He made his debut from the substitute's bench on 25 August 2012, replacing Chris Shuker 74 minutes into a 3\u20131 victory over Morecambe at the Globe Arena. Murphy struggled with hamstring problems whilst the team moved up to second in the league table in his absence. He eventually made his full debut on 20 October 2012, in a 4\u20131 home victory against Wycombe Wanderers. On making his return to fitness, he speculated that \"if there was a hell for footballers that's what you'd do, sit in the stand watching games injured.\" Murphy made only his third appearance of the season against Rochdale on 6 November 2012, but having entered the game as a substitute he was forced off injured after only a few minutes due to a recurrence of his calf injury. He left the club by mutual consent on 8 January 2013."]}, {"page": "Shane Cansdell-Sherriff", "response": ["Sherriff's first professional club was Leeds United, who spotted him playing for the New South Wales academy team.  He spent three years at the club, but only tasted first team football on loan at Rochdale in 2002.  Sherriff was released by Leeds during the club's financial crisis in 2003, and signed for Danish Superliga side AGF Aarhus.  After three years in Denmark, Sherriff was signed by Tranmere Rovers at the start of the 2006/07 season after impressing manager Ronnie Moore on trial and was made club captain, making over 40 appearances in his debut season.  During the 2007/08 season, injuries to the club's first choice wingers Steve Davies and Chris Shuker and the arrival of Andy Taylor at left back saw Sherriff frequently appearing on the left side of midfield."]}]}}
