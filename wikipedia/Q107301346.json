(1808 \u2013 1871) was a Scottish chemist, a pharmacist who provided chloroform to Doctor (later Sir) James Young Simpson for his anaesthesia experiment at 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh on 4 November 1847. This was the first use of this chemical on humans when Simpson tried it on himself and a few friends, and then used it for pain relief in obstetrics, and surgery. This changed medical practice for over a century, according to the British Medical Journal. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Perthshire", "response": ["* William Flockhart"]}, {"page": "Anesthesia", "response": ["Discovered in 1831 by an American physician Samuel Guthrie (1782\u20131848), and independently a few months later by Frenchman Eug\u00e8ne Soubeiran (1797\u20131859) and Justus von Liebig (1803\u20131873) in Germany, chloroform was named and chemically characterized in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1800\u20131884). In 1842, Dr Robert Mortimer Glover in London discovered the anaesthetic qualities of chloroform on laboratory animals. In 1847, Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson was the first to demonstrate the anesthetic properties of chloroform on humans and helped to popularize the drug for use in medicine. This first supply came from local pharmacists, James Duncan and William Flockhart, and its use spread quickly, with 750,000 doses weekly in Britain by 1895. Simpson arranged for Flockhart to supply Florence Nightingale and also gained royal approval in 1853 when John Snow gave it to Queen Victoria during the birth of Prince Leopold. During the birth itself, chloroform met all the Queen's expectations; she stated it was \"delightful beyond measure\".  Chloroform was not without fault though. The first fatality directly attributed to chloroform administration was recorded on 28 January 1848 after the death of Hannah Greener. This was the first of many deaths to follow from the untrained handling of chloroform. Surgeons began to appreciate the need for a trained anesthetist. The need, as Thatcher writes, was for an anesthetist to \u201c(1)Be satisfied with the subordinate role that the work would require, (2) Make anesthesia their one absorbing interest, (3) not look at the situation of anesthetist as one that put them in a position to watch and learn from the surgeons technique (4) accept the comparatively low pay and (5) have the natural aptitude and intelligence to develop a high level of skill in providing the smooth anesthesia and relaxation that the surgeon demanded\" These qualities of an anesthetist were often found in submissive medical students and even members of the public.  More often, surgeons sought out nurses to provide anesthesia. By the time of the Civil War, many nurses had been professionally trained with the support of surgeons."]}, {"page": "Chloroform", "response": ["*In 1847, Scottish obstetrician James Y. Simpson was the first to demonstrate the anaesthetic properties of chloroform on humans, provided by local pharmacist William Flockhart of Duncan, Flockhart and company, and helped to popularise the drug for use in medicine. By the 1850s, chloroform was being produced on a commercial basis, in Britain about 750,000 doses a week by 1895, by using the Liebig procedure, which retained its importance until the 1960s.

Among its founding members were Jacob Bell and William Allen. The Northern British (Scottish) branch began the same year with nine founders including William Flockhart and John Duncan. From 1843 it had a royal charter which identified its chief objectives as the advancement of chemistry and pharmacy, the promotion of a system of education for its practitioners, and the legal protection of its members. In return, the public would benefit from a service provided by qualified professionals."]}, {"page": "James Young Simpson", "response": ["In 1847, Simpson first demonstrated the properties of chloroform upon humans, during an experiment with friends in which he confirmed that it could be used to put one to sleep. Dr Simpson and two of his assistants, Dr George Skene Keith (1819-1910) and James Matthews Duncan (1826-1890), used to sit every evening in Dr Simpson's dining room to try new chemicals to see if they had any anaesthetic effect. Following a visit to Linlithgow, where Simpson was recommended to trial a sample of chloroform from a local pharmacist, David Waldie, Simpson then returned to Edinburgh. On 4 November 1847, Simpson and his friends decided to try chloroform themselves, which Simpson had obtained from local pharmacist William Flockhart of Duncan and Flockhart of North Bridge, Edinburgh. On inhaling the chemical they found that a general mood of cheer and humour had set in, but suddenly all of them collapsed only to regain consciousness the next morning. Simpson knew, as soon as he woke up, that he had found something that could be used as an anaesthetic. They soon had Miss Petrie, Simpson's niece, try it. She fell asleep soon after inhaling it while singing the words, \"I am an angel!\". There is a prevalent myth that the mother of the first child delivered under chloroform christened her child \"Anaesthesia\"; the story is retailed in Simpson's biography as written by his daughter Eve. However, the son of the first baby delivered by chloroform explained that Simpson's patient had been one Jane Carstairs, and her child was baptised Wilhelmina. \"Anaesthesia\" was a nickname Simpson had given the baby.", "thumb|Sir James Young Simpson statue, West Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh|267x267pxSimpson was elected President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1850 and an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1863.
