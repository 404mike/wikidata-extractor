While living in a flat in Shepherd's Bush they met Phil Brown, who after hearing their demo took it to Miles Leonard, who promptly signed the band. Duffield quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and quit the band.

Based more around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into The Beta Band include psychedelia, hip hop and blues. Vocalist Steve Mason described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an ambient bonus disc of two long compositions, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.", "In 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, Champion Versions, The Patty Patty Sound and Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos, which were met with high critical acclaim. After they had signed to Regal Records, a subsidiary of EMI's label Parlophone, the three EPs were released together as the album The Three E.P.'s in September 1998, which similarly was met with positive reviews. In 1999, they signed to Astralwerks in the United States and the label subsequently released The Three E.P.'s in the country. According to writer Ted Hedrickson, the band \u2013 consisting of multi-instrumentalists Steve Mason, Robin Jones, Richard Greentree and John MacLean \u2013 fused musical elements like ambient drones, trip hop beats and Pink Floyd-style introspective balladry to create their unique sound throughout their EPs, and that these releases \"served as a fabulous taster for the band's self-titled debut.\"", "Each song on the album was approached differently; some songs the band developed from a single idea or melody, while the chords and melodies of others were developed beforehand. Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.\" Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed \"the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist\", and mentioned that the songs \"don't really tell a story. It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\" Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything\", with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\" Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:", "The ten songs on the album rely on a snippet of melody, often sung and played on acoustic guitar by Steve Mason, but surrounding his voice are not only guitars or drums but many other, more unusual instruments and techniques, including samples, xylophones, sleigh bells, hand claps, spoons, and a diversity of bird whistles, including a cuckoo, with its songs integrating numerous tape loops and offbeat breakbeats into what writer Ron Hart called the album's \"ambient classic rock jams and textured pop melodies\". The music is said to disregard melody and other examples of musical theory such as verses and choruses in favour a chaotic approach. Jonathan Perry of Rolling Stone, describing the tracks, said:", "A week prior to the album's release, Steve Mason infamously denounced the album as \"fucking awful\", adding that \"it's definitely the worst record we've ever made and it's probably one of the worst records that'll come out this year.\" Speaking to NME, he said the album contained \"some terrible songs\", opining that none of the album's tracks were fully written or developed, dismissing them as \"[h]alf-written songs with jams in the middle.\u201d Greentree felt the production should have been less muddy, while McLean noted that their apparent shortcomings were the band's fault; however, the band also blamed Regal for their dissatisfaction with the final album, including the abandoning of the ambient disc, which they saw as having been incomplete, and for not providing them with enough time or money to work on the album satisfyingly.", "*Steve Mason - vocals"]}, {"page": "Ed Harcourt", "response": ["On 22 October 2017, Harcourt played (as band leader) the whole Sgt.

The avant-garde-ness of it all. It's produced by Jean-Michel Basquiat. It's such an exciting record. It's really fucking weird. There's loads of reverb on the vocal and then that violin comes in. The rap is superb. It's stunning. Plus 'White Lines' is on it.\""]}]}}
