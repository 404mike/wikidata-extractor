Motion (1998), p. 22.Milnes (1848) In the summer of 1803, John was sent to board at John Clarke's school in Enfield, close to his grandparents' house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to Renaissance literature, including Tasso, Spenser, and Chapman's translations. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, \"always in extremes\", given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.Gittings (1987), pp. 1\u20133.", "While continuing to work and train at Guy's, Keats spent more and more time studying literature and experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet \"O Solitude\" in his magazine The Examiner, a leading liberal magazine of the day.Hirsch, Edward (2001) This was the first appearance of Keats's poetry in print; Charles Cowden Clarke called it his friend's red letter day,Colvin (2006), p. 35. the first proof that his ambitions could be achieved. Among his poems of 1816 was To My Brothers. That summer, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began \"Calidore\" and initiated a great period of letter-writing. On returning to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself to study further for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons.Motion (1998), pp. 104\u2013105.", "Although Keats wrote that \"if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all,\" poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's Examiner, which Keats read as a boy.Gittings (1987), pp. 18\u201321. Hunt scorned the Augustan or \"French\" school, dominated by Pope, and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats's few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a \"new school\" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis for the scathing attacks from Blackwood's and the Quarterly Review."]}, {"page": "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "response": ["In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor."]}, {"page": "Henry VI, Part 1", "response": ["thumb|upright=0.70|H. C.

Four of his daughters (of whom the eldest, Mary (1809\u20131898), married Charles Cowden Clarke) were gifted singers; but the most famous was Clara Novello (1818\u20131908), whose soprano voice made her one of the greatest vocalists in opera, as well as in oratorio and on the concert stage, from 1833 onward. In 1843 she married Count Gigliucci, but after a few years returned to her profession, retiring in 1860. Charles Lamb wrote a poem (To Clara N.) in her praise.

Although Gilfillan and Charles Cowden Clarke published the Reliques for Cassell in 1877, Gilfillan's 1858 edition was simultaneously published by James Nichol in Edinburgh, in London by James Nisbet, and in Dublin by W. Robertson, appealing to ready markets in Scotland and Ireland.  As a lecturer and as a preacher he drew large crowds, but his literary reputation proved exceptionally temporary.
