In his adaption, the director John Argyle reused the names of characters and places from the novel and radio script, and recycles some plot ideas and situations, and the basic storyline; but a comparison with the extant 1940 Canadian radio production reveals (unsurprisingly, since five of the eight radio episodes have been omitted) that little of Durbridge's original dialogue, characterisation or detailed plotting survives. Durbridge's trademark ability to construct his radio dramas around the seven cliffhanger endings in his multipart serials is entirely lost."]}, {"page": "John Argyle Productions", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Argyle"]}, {"page": "List of Butcher's Film Service films", "response": ["| Send for Paul Temple || December 1946 || John Argyle ||", "| The Hills of Donegal || September 1947 || John Argyle ||"]}, {"page": "Argyle, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Argyle"]}]}}
