Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the US, TV Guide ran a four-page photo spread on Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967).

Although Quant reportedly named the skirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini, there is no consensus as to who designed it first. Valerie Steele has noted that the claim that Quant was first is more convincingly supported by evidence than the equivalent Courr\u00e8ges claim. However, the contemporary fashion journalist Marit Allen, who edited the influential \"Young Ideas\" pages for UK Vogue, firmly stated that the British designer John Bates was the first to offer fashionable miniskirts.

In January 1965 Bates's \"skimp dress\" with its \"short-short skirt\" was featured in Vogue, and would later be chosen as the Dress of the Year.

John Bates was brought in as the costume designer for Emma Peel in the second half of the fourth series. He created a wardrobe of black and white op-art mod clothing and miniskirts. Before this, people had believed that lines, circles and other bold patterns would not work on the television cameras of the day. Episodes were filmed before the miniskirt had even become a mainstream fashion statement. Bates had to stop leaving hems on the mini skirts because the production team kept lowering them again. He also licensed his designs to several manufacturers under the Avengerswear label and these pieces were sold in various shops throughout the country. Diana Rigg is often remembered for the leather catsuit she wore early on in her first season.
