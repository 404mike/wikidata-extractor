He may be best known for his contributions to aeroacoustics, in particular for his work on Concorde. Together with one of his students, David Hawkings, he introduced the far-field integration method in computational aeroacoustics based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy, known as the Ffowcs Williams\u2013Hawkings analogy.Ffowcs was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in 1995 for contributions to the theory of jet noise, and other aspects of aeroacoustics and hydrodynamics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 25", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 John Ffowcs Williams, Welsh engineer and academic (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "John Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Ffowcs Williams (born 1935), professor of engineering at the University of Cambridge, former Master of Emmanuel College"]}, {"page": "Steve Furber", "response": ["Furber was educated at Manchester Grammar School and represented the UK in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hungary in 1970 winning a bronze medal.
