The discoverer, British palaeontologist Thomas Rupert Jones, speculated in 1875 this was an early counting system for tallying items such as animals killed, or some other notation system. In 1957, Czech archaeologist Karel Absolon suggested they represent arithmetic. In 1972, Marshack postulated they may be calendars. Also in 1972, Marshack identified 15 to 13 thousand year old Magdalenian plaques bearing small, abstract symbols seemingly into organised blocks or sets, which he interpreted as representing an early writing system."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society J, K, L", "response": ["| Thomas Rupert Jones||6 June 1872||1 October 1819 \u2013 13 April 1911 Physician & Prof of Geology"]}, {"page": "Charles Davies Sherborn", "response": ["Sherborn developed a passionate interest in geology and paleontology and in 1883 he was asked by geologist Thomas Rupert Jones to help illustrate and complete some papers he was writing on fossil Foraminifera.

It was answered by Sampson Arnold Mackey in a Lecture on Astronomy (1832). His scientific views were discussed at some length by William Floyd Karkeek, writing on The Geological History of the Horse in The Veterinarian in 1841.

Thereafter Stow spent a great deal of his time exploring the Cretaceous deposits within the Sundays and Zwartkops basins near Port Elizabeth and the Karroo System near Dordrecht. After the war Stow was persuaded by Dr. Richard Nathaniel Rubidge to report his discoveries to Thomas Rupert Jones of The Geological Society. At a meeting of The Geological Society on 17 November 1858, a paper by Stow \"On Some Fossils from South Africa\" was read. The species was later named Micropholis stowi by Huxley, and is currently placed in the family Amphibamidae. The paper was the first of many contributions by Stow to geological journals, the most important probably being \"Geological Notes on Griqualand West\" published in the Quarterly Journal of 1874, shortly after he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1872. His landmark work on the geology of Griqualand West was never published.", "In the early 1870s Stow had set himself up as a wholesale wine merchant in Kimberley, a business that many found more profitable than digging for diamonds. However, geology was his first love and when he heard in 1872 that the Cape Colony Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, needed a geographical report on Griqualand West, he immediately put forward his name. His offer was accepted and a fee of \u00a350 was agreed on. Sir Henry Barkly took Stow's maps and manuscript to England with him in 1877 where they were highly commended by both Sir Andrew Ramsay and Thomas Rupert Jones, but were never published, to the great detriment of South African geology. The documents were eventually returned and are preserved by the Geological Society of South Africa. In 1877 the Orange Free State commissioned him to do a geological survey.", "While doing his field work Stow became familiar with rock art in the caves and shelters of South Africa.
