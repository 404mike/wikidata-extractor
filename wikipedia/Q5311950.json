A right-handed batsman, Pope was born in Barnes and is recorded in the 1911 Census as living in Richmond, Surrey at age four. He played 159 first-class matches for Essex and Gloucestershire between 1925 and his death in a car accident in 1934. He scored 6,557 runs at 26.33, including seven centuries, and formed a \"solid professional nucleus\" along with such players as Jim Cutmore, Laurie Eastman, Jack O'Connor, Jack Russell and Stan Nichols. In 1933 Pope, along with many of these players, scored over 1,000 runs, the first time six Essex batsmen had topped 1,000 in a season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dudley Pope", "response": ["Dudley Pope was born in Ashford, Kent. By concealing his age he joined the Home Guard aged 14 and at age 16 joined the merchant navy as a cadet. His ship was torpedoed the next year (1942). Afterwards, he spent two weeks in a lifeboat with the few other survivors.  After he was invalided out the only obvious sign of the injuries he had suffered was a joint missing from one finger due to gangrene. Pope then went to work for a Kentish newspaper, then in 1944 moved to The Evening News in London, where he was the naval and defence correspondent.
