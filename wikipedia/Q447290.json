In 1926 Mr Gibson renamed them after men who had done the school great service in its formative years and associated one quarter of the coat-of-arms to each house as a badge. A was renamed Alleyn after Edward Alleyn, the Renaissance actor whose foundation, College of God's Gift, funded the school from 1891. B was renamed Gassiot after John Peter Gassiot, a businessman who was treasurer from the school's opening and each year would make good the deficit. C was renamed Rogers after Reverend William Rogers, the principal founder of the school. D was renamed Wormell after Dr Richard Wormell, the Second Master at the school's opening who rose to Headmaster in 1874 and remained at the school until his retirement in 1897, keeping close ties to the Old Cowperians Society thereafter."]}, {"page": "Henry Collen", "response": ["*Articles about Henry Collen.
