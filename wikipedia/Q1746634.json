Augustus Granville, Hindley's doctor, later alleged that Hindley had been suffering from delirium, hallucination, and inflammation of the brain, but had been recovering thanks to the treatments ordered by Granville (mustard plasters, bleeding,  calomel, and antimony), which had been effective on four or five similar past episodes.  However, without consulting Granville, Hindley's son-in-law had called in Robert Bentley Todd, FRS, FRCS.  The Dictionary of National Biography entry for Todd notes \"Todd was the first to lay down definite principles for the treatment of specially serious cases of fever, such as influenza and rheumatic fever, besides inflammations associated with exhaustion in which life was in jeopardy. In these cases Todd proved from patient observation the desirability of a steady administering of alcoholic stimulants at short intervals, day and night, while the danger lasted. By this treatment not only was the strength maintained, but the period of convalescence was shortened.\" According to Granville, Todd had taken a less sanguine view of Hindley's case than Granville (\"the patient is slipping through your fingers from delirium tremens\") and insisted that Hindley should take an ounce of brandy every  half-hour, reducing this to half-an-ounce every half-hour on the representations of Granville, but soon reverting to the higher dosage. By the time Hindley died he had taken six pints of brandy in seventy-two hours;  Granville alleged that although Hindley's death certificate gave the cause of death as 'cerebral affectation', Todd had caused Hindley's death by 'an obstinate adherence to one of the most pernicious practices ever palmed upon an ignorant public', but Granville made no mention of this in the two years between Hindley's death and Todd's.
