Gahan is known for his \"commanding presence on stage\" and his \"huge, deep baritone voice\".Although his bandmate Martin Gore continues to be the main songwriter for Depeche Mode, Gahan has contributed a number of songs to the albums Playing the Angel (2005), Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013) and Spirit (2017). Four of these songs were released as singles, including \"Suffer Well\" in 2005, \"Hole to Feed\" in 2009, \"Should Be Higher\" in 2013, and \"Cover Me\" in 2017.\nGahan's albums as a solo artist are Paper Monsters (released 2003) and Hourglass (2007).

The group consists of a trio of Dave Gahan (lead vocals and co-songwriting), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, co-lead vocals and main songwriting) and Andy Fletcher (keyboards).", "Dave Gahan joined the band later in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local Scout hut jam session, singing a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", and Depeche Mode was born. Gahan's and Gore's favourite artists included Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sparks, Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads and Iggy Pop. Gahan's persona onstage was influenced by Dave Vanian, frontman of The Damned. Gahan has also credited David Bowie, James Brown, Elvis Presley and Prince as influences.", "The band made a demo tape but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, \"most of them would tell us to fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else.\"", "The members of Depeche Mode regrouped in Madrid in January 1992, Dave Gahan had become interested in the new grunge scene sweeping the U.S. and was influenced by the likes of Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden and Nirvana.", "In August 2007, during promotion for Dave Gahan's second solo album, Hourglass, it was announced that Depeche Mode were heading back in studio in early 2008 to work on a new album.", "In May 2009, the band embarked on a concert tour in support of the album \u2013 called Tour of the Universe; it had been announced at a press conference in October 2008 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. There was a warm up show in Luxembourg and it officially started on 10 May 2009 in Tel Aviv. The first leg of the tour was disrupted when Dave Gahan was struck down with gastroenteritis. During treatment, doctors found and removed a low grade tumour from the singer's bladder. Gahan's illness caused 16 concerts to be cancelled, but several of the shows were rescheduled for 2010. The band headlined the Lollapalooza festival during the North American leg of the tour. The tour also took the band back to South America for the first time since 1994's Exotic Tour. During the final European leg, the band played a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust, where former member Alan Wilder joined Martin Gore on stage for a performance of \"Somebody\". In total the band played to more than 2.7 million people across 32 countries and the tour was one of the most profitable in America in 2009.

That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact\". When asked \"who do you regret not going to see live\", guitarist Johnny Marr replied \"Siouxsie and the Banshees mk 1. But mk 2 were even better\".

In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single \"Candyman\" at its release, saying, \"She always sounds exciting. She sings with a lot of sex - that's what I like. This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound. I used to see them quite a lot when I was younger.\" Commenting on the original Banshees line-up and they were different from other groups, Gahan said:  \"Siouxsie And The Banshees, whom I adored, sang much more abstract, artistic about frustration. Colder and darker\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected \"Jigsaw Feeling\" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \"Hong Kong Garden\" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, saying \"it was a completely new world\". Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences.

I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees\". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, \"They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We\u2019re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we\u2019re coming from\".
