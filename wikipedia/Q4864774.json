The signing of the Australian leg break bowler Bruce Dooland, arrested the decline but until the signing of the incomparable Garfield Sobers in 1968, the team was weak. Sobers hit Malcolm Nash of Glamorgan for six sixes in an over in a County Championship game at Swansea in his first season. Mike Harris scored heavily in the 1970s, including nine centuries in 1971 but apart from Barry Stead, the bowling lacked penetration."]}, {"page": "Stead", "response": ["* Barry Stead (1939\u20131980), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Sydney Shepherd", "response": ["Shepherd's final appearance in the Minor Counties Championship was in June 1959 against the Yorkshire seconds, when he was nearly 52 years of age, and his second-innings 3-83 included the distinguished scalps of Brian Bolus, Jack Birkenshaw and Barry Stead."]}, {"page": "1972 English cricket season", "response": [" || Barry Stead || 4482 || 173 || 1998 || 98 || 20.38"]}]}}
