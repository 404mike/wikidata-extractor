Whilst doing his apprenticeship Nyafli joined Whitstable Town on loan where he made one appearance for the club. The following season he joined Merstham, Ramsgate and Eastbourne Borough on loan. He was named among the substitutes for the final game of Gillingham's 2012\u201313 season against Burton Albion, and after replacing Kane Haysman, he converted Sam Muggleton's long throw to score his first senior goal for the club with his very first touch. He did not feature for the first team in the 2013\u201314 season, however, due to an ongoing hip problem, which proved too severe for the forward to continue playing, and his retirement from professional football was announced on 4 February 2014."]}]}}
