He also played in the Football League for Rotherham United, Oldham Athletic, Wigan Athletic, Tranmere Rovers, Stockport County and Bury before winding his career in Non-league football with Morecambe, Southport, Fleetwood Town and Bamber Bridge.\nFollowing retirement, Barlow worked away from the sport for a number of years before being appointed assistant manager Northern Premier League side Colwyn Bay in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fazakerley", "response": ["* Stuart Barlow"]}, {"page": "DW Stadium", "response": ["The first away team to win a competitive football match at the stadium was Wigan Athletic.

His time at Tranmere Rovers is most memorable for the FA Cup match against former club Southampton, in which he scored three of four second half goals to win the game after his team had been 3\u20130 down at half-time, Stuart Barlow scoring the other. However, on the league scene it was not a successful time for player and club. They were relegated in bottom place at the end of his first season after a decade of second tier football, which had seen manager John Aldridge forced out of his job after five years at the helm. Rideout's former Everton teammate Dave Watson was then appointed manager at Prenton Park, but was unable to restore Tranmere to Division One in Rideout's final season before retiring as a player."]}, {"page": "1995 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Everton, meanwhile, had escaped from a relegation dogfight which had seen them make their worst start to a league campaign (eight points from a possible 42 after 14 games), with a superbly successful cup run which saw them reach Wembley having conceded only one goal (a penalty for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann of Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final, which Everton won 4\u20131). Everton's only absentee was defender Earl Barrett who was cup-tied, and had therefore not been part of Everton's FA cup campaign. Duncan Ferguson passed a fitness test on the day of the game, however, Ferguson was only given a place on the substitutes bench, with Everton fielding the same starting XI that defeated Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-final. There was no place among the substitutes for homegrown boyhood Blue John Ebbrell, with Daniel Amokachi being preferred on the bench after he scored twice in the semi-final. Stuart Barlow and Vinny Samways were the other players from the original 17-man cup final squad to not make the 14-man matchday squad. Ebbrell, Barlow and Samways all missed the semi-final against Spurs due to injury, allowing Amokachi to take a place on the substitutes bench; he then scored two goals after mistakenly coming on for Paul Rideout. Rideout had been a doubt for the game with a knee ligament injury and appeared to have suffered a recurrence midway through the second half; after receiving treatment from the Everton physio, Rideout indicated he was ready to return to action, but Amokachi misinterpreted his signal and entered the field, with the substitution confirmed by the fourth official."]}, {"page": "Premier League All Stars", "response": ["Legends - David Lowe, Stuart Barlow, Colin Greenall"]}, {"page": "2000 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["The final drew a crowd of 53,764 and was refereed by Rob Styles.

Wigan manager John Benson, who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the appointment of a new manager, picked the same eleven players who had started the second leg of the play-off semi-final; the line-up included five players who had played at Wembley in the previous season's Football League Trophy final.  There was media speculation that Benson would recall goalkeeper Carroll, by now fully recovered from his operation,  but ultimately he opted to again select Stillie, and Carroll was named as one of the substitutes.Classic Match : Wigan Athletic 2\u20133 Gillingham (AET) 2000 Division 2 Play-off Final, 00:01:04\u201300:01:13  Stuart Barlow, the club's top goalscorer during the regular season, had recently recovered from an operation on his ankle and it was anticipated that he would be named as a substitute, but he was ultimately named in the starting line-up.
