When he was still young and unknown, award-winning British novelist Julian Barnes (born 1946) published some crime novels under the alias Dan Kavanagh. Other authors take delight in cherishing their alter egos; Ruth Rendell (1930\u20132015) writes one sort of crime novels as Ruth Rendell and another type as Barbara Vine; John Dickson Carr also used the pseudonym Carter Dickson. Author Evan Hunter (which itself was a pseudonym) wrote his crime fiction under the name of Ed McBain."]}, {"page": "1951 in literature", "response": ["* Cyril Hare \u2013 An English Murder"]}, {"page": "1958 in literature", "response": ["*Cyril Hare \u2013 He Should Have Died Hereafter"]}, {"page": "List of crime writers", "response": ["*Cyril Hare (1900\u20131958, E), pseudonym of Alfred Alexander Gordon Clark"]}, {"page": "Box Hill, Surrey", "response": ["Mystery author Cyril Hare sets his 1954 novel, That Yew Tree's Shade (published in the U.S. as Death Walks the Woods), at \"Yew Hill\", which Hare admits in an introduction is modelled on Box Hill."]}, {"page": "List of works titled after Shakespeare", "response": ["*With a Bare Bodkin by Cyril Hare (III.i)"]}, {"page": "Mickleham, Surrey", "response": ["* Detective story writer Cyril Hare was born in Mickleham Hall in 1900 and died at Westhumble in the parish in 1958; he is buried in the churchyard.

The Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Relationship Act 1931 (21 & 22 Geo.5 c.31) extended the operation of the 1907 Act to allow the marriages of nieces and nephews by marriage as well. All three Acts were repealed and replaced by the Marriage Enabling Act 1960 (1960 c.29), which permitted marriage with a relative of a divorced former spouse, as well as of a deceased spouse.
