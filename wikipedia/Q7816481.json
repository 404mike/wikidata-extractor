Foulke had to be stopped by a group of FA officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the referee.Kirkham also refereed the replay, which Sheffield United won 2\u20131.\nHe also refereed the international match between Scotland and Ireland on 21 March 1903, followed by the matches between Scotland and Wales on 12 March 1904 and between Scotland and Ireland on 18 March 1905.He is often confused with Fred Kirkham (from Preston) who refereed the 1906 FA Cup Final.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Foulke (footballer)", "response": ["At the end of the first match in the 1902 FA Cup Final, Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed.
