The Wall Live 1980\u201381), as well as Sound Coordinator on the film adaptation Pink Floyd\u2014The Wall (he would engineer the music for film as well as produce it in collaboration with Waters and Gilmour). Guthrie received a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Film Sound in 1982 for his work on the film, (along with sound editor Eddy Joseph, production mixer Clive Winter, and dubbing mixers Graham Hartstone and Nicholas Le Messurier). He was then asked to co-produce (along with Michael Kamen) The Final Cut, the last release of Waters-era Pink Floyd. According to Andy Jackson, who served as engineer for the recording along with Guthrie, the use of the name \"Max\" in the songs \"The Gunner's Dream\" and \"Paranoid Eyes\" is an appropriation of Guthrie's nickname (the members of the production team \u2013 Guthrie, Jackson and Kamen \u2013 each had nicknames), which Waters had originally included as a joke, but decided that it suited the overall concept and created an actual character in the narrative with the name.Bailey ibid."]}, {"page": "57th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Cold Mountain \u2013 Eddy Joseph, Ivan Sharrock, Walter Murch, Mike Prestwood Smith and Matthew Gough"]}, {"page": "55th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone \u2013 John Midgley, Eddy Joseph, Ray Merrin, Graham Daniel and Adam Daniel"]}, {"page": "50th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Evita \u2013 Anna Behlmer, Eddy Joseph, Andy Nelson, Ken Weston and Nigel Wright"]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["* Eddy Joseph (born 1945), sound engineer"]}, {"page": "45th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* The Commitments \u2013 Clive Winter, Eddy Joseph, Andy Nelson, Tom Perry and Steve Pederson"]}, {"page": "60th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["Casino Royale \u2013 Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell and Mark Taylor", "* United 93 \u2013 Chris Munro, Mike Prestwood Smith, Douglas Cooper, Oliver Tarney and Eddy Joseph"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Sound", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall || style=\"background:#ccc;\"| James Guthrie, Eddy Joseph, Clive Winter, Graham V.
