He became head of the mission and was involved in the councils of King George Tupou I, who made him his prime minister in 1880. A disagreement arose with the Wesleyan authorities at Sydney in 1879, and Baker founded an independent body under the title of the \"Free Church of Tonga\". Some of the natives, however, were loyal to their original church and much strong feeling was aroused, which resulted with an attempt to shoot Baker in 1887. He escaped unhurt, but his son and daughter were both wounded. Six Tongans were executed for this crime, and many were deported to other islands. In 1888, the Rev. George Brown visited Tonga to inquire into the position and to endeavour to heal the breach between the two churches. He did not succeed, and his reports show that Baker was using his power to the disadvantage of those who were not adherents of the Free Church. In 1890, Sir John Bates Thurston visited Tonga and deported Baker at short notice to Auckland for being 'prejudicial to the peace and good order of the Western Pacific'."]}, {"page": "Satupa\u02bbitea", "response": ["During the 19th century, Satupaitea was an important stronghold for the early Methodist mission in Samoa.

Wallis partitioned the Secretaries in London for permission to return to Raglan and about October 1838, seeing as the area had still not been occupied by the CMS, his return was approved.Margaret Reeson, 'Pacific Missionary George Brown 1835-1917 Wesleyan Methodist Church', Canberra, ANU, 2013.

However, as Christianity took roots in these islands, the belief system for Kulap figures vanished. Particularly when the Australian administration of New Ireland was established in 1914, the ritual practice ceased to exist. However, during the colonial rule, the figurines were sold to Westerners for their cultural value. The earliest recorded history of these figures was provided by Reverend George Brown during his visit to an area on the west coast at Patpatar of southern New Ireland where the language spoken was Hinsal. Brown had noted that these figures were kept in a large, painted, corner house, which was well maintained on protected land. The building had kept two, large, painted human figures (one large male figure and the other smaller but not intended for worship) inferred to be linked to some kind of superstition as people danced in front of the figures.

On 6 April at Tanaka, Reverend Naucukidi was suddenly attacked and slain, and his body dismembered and cannibalized. Consequently, three other Fijian missionaries; Reverend Livai Naboro, Reverend Peni Luvu and Layman Timoci Baravi were slain at Talakua in what is now Tungnaparau. Rev Luvu managed to break free from the ambush after he defended himself with a club he grabbed from one of the attackers.
