One of Leech's discoveries was a lattice packing in 24-space, based on what came to be called the Leech lattice \u039b. He wondered whether his lattice's symmetry group contained an interesting simple group, but felt he needed the help of someone better acquainted with group theory. He had to do much asking around because the mathematicians were pre-occupied with agendas of their own. John Conway agreed to look at the problem. John G. Thompson said he would be interested if he were given the order of the group. Conway expected to spend months or years on the problem, but found results in just a few sessions."]}, {"page": "Taxicab number", "response": ["The taxicab numbers subsequent to 1729 were found with the help of computers.
