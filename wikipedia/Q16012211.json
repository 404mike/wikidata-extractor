He also appeared in the third series as the torturer Shrinker. He also appeared in the Doctor Who serial The Creature from the Pit.\nOther television credits include: Justice, Bel Ami, Danger Man, The Baron, Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars, The Champions, Softly, Softly, The First Lady, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), The Guardians, The Troubleshooters, Colditz, Rock Follies, The Gentle Touch,  Wilde Alliance and Only Fools and Horses. His film roles included the estate agent in the horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood (1970), and Cardinal Wolsey in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972).\nNote: I'm sorry but there's no way John Bryans was born on 5 August 1942. This date refers to John Victor Mortimer Bryans who died on 2 August 1989. The actor looked older so would have had to be born prior to 1942. What's more, I've seen his name mentioned in newspapers such as The Stage as early as 1946. Bryans' birth date has eluded me for years. Maybe this is a stage name and his real name is something else?", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Wolsey", "response": ["* Wolsey was played by John Baskcomb in The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970) and by John Bryans when the series was made into the film Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972)."]}, {"page": "Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)", "response": ["* John Bryans"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Dudley FosterIsobel BlackNorman RodwayMichael GuestDavid DodimeadJohn BryansGeoffrey HinsliffKevin StoneyHoward Charlton", "| Robert HarrisBarry JusticeJohn PhillipsRosemary LeachJennifer DanielJohn BryansDonald Morley", "| Norman RodwayNigel DavenportPhilip BondJohn BryansDonald GeeRhoda LewisArthur CoxArnold Ridley", "| Nigel DavenportNorman RodwayStephanie BidmeadFiona WalkerJohn BryansJill MelfordPatricia MaynardTony BlackburnJudith ChalmersStephen Jack"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Alan Webb,Rosalie Crutchley,Michael Pennington,Christopher Timothy,Nigel Terry,John Allison,Tamara Hinchco,David Lincoln,George A.
