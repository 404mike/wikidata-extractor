Beatles producer George Martin credited him with bringing \"a new kind of mind to the recordings, always suggesting sonic ideas, different kinds of reverb, what we could do with the voices\".Emerick also engineered the Zombies' Odessey and Oracle (1968), Paul McCartney and Wings' Band on the Run (1973) and Elvis Costello's Imperial Bedroom (1982), among many others. He won four Grammy Awards for his work in the music recording field. His 2006 memoir Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles caused controversy for its factual errors.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence \"that everything on Sgt. Pepper had to be different. We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around.\" Parts of \"A Day in the Life\" featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967; the Sgt. Pepper LP followed with a rush-release in May. The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists.  Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. Gould writes:", "Making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and, especially, Revolver onwards."]}, {"page": "1945", "response": ["* December 4 \u2013 Geoff Emerick, English recording engineer (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Calliope (music)", "response": ["The Beatles, in recording \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" from the album Sgt.

According to Rodriguez, Revolver marked the first time the Beatles integrated studio technology into the \"conception of the recordings they made\". He views this approach as reflective of the group's waning interest in live performance before crowds of screaming fans, \"in favor of creating soundscapes without limitation\" in a studio environment. For the first time at EMI Studios, the company's four-track tape machines were placed in the studio's control room, alongside the producer and balance engineer, rather than in a dedicated machine room. The Beatles' new recording engineer on the project was nineteen-year-old Geoff Emerick, whom author and critic Ian MacDonald describes as an \"English audio experimentalist\" in the tradition of Joe Meek. Emerick recalled that no preproduction or rehearsal process took place for Revolver; instead, the band used the studio to create each song from what was often just an outline of a composition.
