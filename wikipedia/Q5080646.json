He worked as a railway goods agent, and was elected to Sale Borough Council in 1932 (serving until 1935) and 1945 (retiring the following year). At the 1950 general election he fought Northwich as the Labour candidate; in 1951 he fought Stretford and in 1955 he was the candidate in Oldham East.\nHe was reselected for Oldham East and won the seat in the 1959 general election, against the national tide because of depression in the local textiles industry. This was the only seat in England which went from Conservative to Labour at that election. Mapp was re-elected at the 1964 and 1966 elections. He retired at the 1970 general election.\nMapp also worked as a juvenile court magistrate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Mapp"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Mapp"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Mapp"]}, {"page": "Oldham East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Mapp"]}, {"page": "I'm Backing Britain", "response": ["The campaign took a knock when the London wholesaler Scott Lester ordered thousands of white T-shirts on which it screen-printed the \"I'm Backing Britain\" slogan; the shirts had been made in Portugal.
