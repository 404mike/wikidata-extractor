His work varied but a continual theme was his \"heavily stylised female nudes\". He exhibited in London and Paris with the Piccadilly Gallery, before being taken on by the gallery owner Lucy Wertheim and towards the end of his career the noted Swiss dealer Walter Feilchenfeldt.In the 1960s, he undertook several large commissions to paint extensive murals for Sussex University (where he was later given a retrospective exhibition) and the Georgian Club in London. His work is held by the Arts Council of Great Britain and University of Johannesburg.\nIn the 1970s, his work fell out of favour and he disappeared from the art scene.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Didcot", "response": ["* Figurative artist Rodney Gladwell was born in the town in 1928.
