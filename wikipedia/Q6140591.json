James Ogilvy-Grant, was a Scottish peer and Conservative Member of Parliament (MP).\nSeafield was the fourth son of Francis William Ogilvy-Grant, 6th Earl of Seafield, and Mary Anne Dunn. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army. At the 1868 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Elginshire and Nairnshire as a Conservative, a seat he held until his defeat at the 1874 general election. In 1884 he succeeded his nephew as ninth Earl of Seafield. A few months later he was created Baron Strathspey, of Strathspey in the Counties of Inverness and Moray, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title, a revival of the barony created for his elder brother in 1858, gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords.\nLord Seafield was married three times. He married firstly Caroline Louisa, daughter of Eyre Evans, in 1841. After his first wife's death in 1850 he married secondly Constance Helena, daughter of Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, in 1853. She died in 1872 and Seafield married thirdly Georgina Adelaide, daughter of Frederick Nathaniel Walker. Lord Seafield died in June 1888, aged 70, and was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, Francis William Ogilvy-Grant.\nLord Seafield is buried at the mausoleum at Duthil Old Parish Church and Churchyard, just outside the village of Duthil, Inverness-shire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl of Seafield", "response": ["*James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield (1817\u20131888)"]}, {"page": "Baron Strathspey", "response": ["The barony was revived only a few months after it first became extinct in favour of the late Earl's uncle, James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield (who had also succeeded him in the baronetcy of Colquhoun; see Colquhoun baronets for earlier history of this title). The barony and baronetcy remained subsidiary titles of the earldom until the death of the ninth Earl's grandson, the eleventh Earl, in 1915.

He did give credit, however, to her management of the estates: 'During her life she kept the estates intact and tried to pay off the debt, which, in fact, she nearly succeeding in doing - an achievement much to her credit.'  Lord Strathspey was particularly critical of the Countess Dowager's policy of keeping at a long distance those who inherited her son's titles of honour: James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield, Francis William Ogilvy-Grant, 10th Earl of Seafield and James Ogilvy-Grant, 11th Earl of Seafield. 'All family contacts with her ... were through her law agent. Through him she sent various members of the family periodic small remittances ... and they were, it would thus appear, paid to keep away.'", "After Duthil Parish Church was reconstructed in the 1830s, and a former family vaunt was closed, Francis William Ogilvy-Grant, 6th Earl of Seafield had a new self-standing Mausoleum built 1837-39 immediately beside the church in the churchyard. The coffins of both John Charles and Ian Charles were interred here and the Countess Dowager then had a second, twin, Mausoleum built, located just outside the existing churchyard. Here James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield was interred in 1888."]}]}}
