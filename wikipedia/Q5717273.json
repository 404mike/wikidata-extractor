In April 1887, his father, Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip, died. As a result of this, Samuel Allsopp succeeded, entering the House of Lords as a peer. This left the parliamentary constituency of Taunton vacant. The Conservative Party offered Samuel Allsopp's brother, Alfred Percy Allsopp (commonly known as Percy Allsopp) the chance to contest the vacancy. Initially it was reported that the Liberal Party would not contest the seat if Percy Allsopp was the only Conservative candidate, but a meeting of the local executive could not reach a consensus: some believed that as the area was so strongly Conservative, a large loss would be damaging to the party, while others wanted to generate a debate on Home Rule. Despite the Taunton executive of the Conservative Party selecting Percy Allsopp as their preferred candidate, the town's Mayor, Samuel Farrant, declared that he would also stand for the Conservatives, which led to concern within that party that a split of the votes could result in a Liberal candidate being elected. Farrant later withdrew his candidacy, leaving Allsopp as the Conservative's sole representative. After their initial uncertainty, the Liberals opted to give the Taunton electorate the opportunity to show their views on Home Rule, and chose James Harris Sanders, of London, as their candidate.", "Alfred Percy Allsopp was the seventh, and youngest, son of Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip, and at the time of the election, was resident in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He often accompanied his brother during his time in office in Taunton, and had occasionally represented him in the town. The Taunton Courier noted that at one dinner, he \"made a great impression by the perspicacity of his utterances, by the breadth of view they indicated, and by his fluency of speech.\" He was a partner in Samuel Allsopp & Sons, which along with Guinness and Bass was one of the largest brewers in the world."]}, {"page": "Burton ale", "response": ["Samuel Allsopp & Sons expanded rapidly under the direction of Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip.
