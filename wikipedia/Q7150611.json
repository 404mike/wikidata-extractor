Rex in 1974, and played additional drums with Davy Lutton on the songs \"Solid Baby\", \"Funky London Childhood\", and \"Visions Of Domino\".\nFenton also played in Carmen, a progressive rock band with a flamenco focus.  The band released three albums between 1973 and 1975.\nFenton along with Mickey Finn, formed a T. Rex tribute band in 1997, named Mickey Finn's T-Rex. Even after the death of Finn in 2003, he continued to play drums for the band, which now performs named more simply as T-Rex.

Marmalade), former T.Rex tour manager, to The Marc Bolan Anniversary Concert to celebrate Marc's 50th birthday, taking place at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, where Gray was manager. Prior to this, Gray had taken former road manager Mick O'Halloran to visit Mickey Finn at his home (Gray and Finn had remained good friends through the years) to persuade him to attend the Cambridge bash. This idea was Gray's brainchild to celebrate Bolan's 50th birthday. Other artists appearing included John's Children and Rolan Bolan with T.Rextasy being the house band and paid \u00a31,500 for the privilege by the organiser. Drummer Bill Legend was invited to appear, but did not appear on the night due to ongoing personal problems. Finn, Fenton, and Green were overwhelmed with the support at that gig, so they decided to form Mickey Finn's T. Rex. The line-up was Finn (congas), Fenton (drums), Green (guitar and vocals), Dave Major (keyboards), and Tony Allday (bass guitar). One year later, Rob Benson, a lifelong fan of T. Rex, went to see the reformed band in Northampton's Chicago Rock cafe. He met the band afterward and was asked to send an audition tape after claiming to be able to sing like Marc Bolan. The band's manager Barry Newby decided that the voice was essential to the T. Rex sound and, after hearing Rob's tape, invited him to a further audition; soon he was asked to be lead vocalist. The band renamed themselves Mickey Finn's T-Rex, and acquired the legal trademark rights for the \"T-Rex\" bandname. In 1999, guitarist Jack Green (who had played in T.Rex in 1973-1974) left and was replaced by founding member of Smokie Alan Silson.", "The band continues to tour Europe, with a much heavier sound than T. Rex had originally. They play classic T. Rex songs from the 1970s. The only member now in the group that had any connection to T. Rex is drummer Paul Fenton.
