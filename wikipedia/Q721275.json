After seeing action at the capture of Charleston during the American Revolutionary War, he saw action again, as captain of the third-rate HMS Defence, at the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, gaining the distinction of commanding the first ship to break through the enemy line.\nGambier went on to be a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and First Naval Lord and then served as Governor of Newfoundland. Together with General Lord Cathcart, he oversaw the bombardment of Copenhagen during the Napoleonic Wars. He later survived an accusation of cowardice for his inaction at the Battle of the Basque Roads.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 19", "response": ["*1833 \u2013 James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier, Bahamian-English admiral and politician, 36th Commodore Governor of Newfoundland (b. 1756)"]}, {"page": "October 13", "response": ["*1756 \u2013 James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier, English admiral and politician, 36th Commodore Governor of Newfoundland (d. 1833)"]}, {"page": "Gambier", "response": ["* James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier (1756\u20131833), a British admiral also known as Lord Gambier"]}, {"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["The ranks of Fleet Admiral and Admiral of the Red were formally separated from 1805, with an announcement in the London Gazette that \"His Majesty [has] been pleased to order the Rank of Admirals of the Red to be restored\"The Dictionary of National Biography (Volume 20, page 394) says of James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier that he \"seems to have been as ignorant of naval history as careless of naval prestige, and must be considered one of the chief of the perpetrators of the official blunder which, in the warrant of 9 Nov. 1805 appointing admirals of the red, spoke of the rank as restored to the navy, whereas, in point of fact, it had never previously existed.\" in His Majesty's Navy...\" as a separate role. The same Gazette promoted 22 men to that rank. From the nineteenth century onward there were also occasional variations to the previous requirement that only one Admiral of Fleet could serve at one time. In 1821 George IV appointed Sir John Jervis as a second admiral of the fleet, to balance Lord Wellingtons promotion as a second Field Marshal in the British Army. In 1830 King William IV increased the number of admirals of the fleet to three, though these additional lifetime postings subsequently lapsed. Between 1854 and 1857 there was no admiral of the fleet at all as the most senior naval officer of the time  Admiral of the Red Thomas Le Marchant Gosselin  was mentally ill and had not served at sea for forty-five years. In deference to Gosselin's seniority the position was instead left vacant until his death in 1857, whereupon it was filled by admiral Charles Ogle."]}, {"page": "Thomas Gambier Parry", "response": ["Gambier Parry's parents, Richard and Mary Parry of Banstead, Surrey, died when he was young and he was raised by his maternal aunts and uncles, the Gambiers, among them  James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier.
