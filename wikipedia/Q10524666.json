The support stemmed from the club having two Grenada internationals, Aaron Pierre and Omar Beckles, who helped the nation to a six-match unbeaten run in qualifying for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.  The president of the Grenada Football Association, Cheney Joseph, adopted The Shrews as his team, stating \"I have fallen in love with Shrewsbury. I\u2019m serious. I believe they can become a dream story, a Cinderella story\". In November 2019, Joseph sent a partnership offer to the club, as well as a formal invitation for Town chairman Roland Wycherley to visit the country. On 9 November, Oliver Norburn became the third Town player to be called up by Grenada, whom he qualified for through his paternal grandfather. On 26 January 2020, Joseph made his first visit to his adopted club, where he witnessed The Shrews come back from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 with Premier League leaders and European and World champions Liverpool, setting up a replay at Anfield."]}, {"page": "David Edwards (footballer, born 1986)", "response": ["Edwards re-signed for League One club Shrewsbury Town on 7 January 2019 on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

Fair play protocol dictates that the ball be passed to the Baintree goalkeeper, Tom King, on resumption of play, but Oliver Norburn instead lobbed the ball past King to score an equalising goal. A fracas resulted but the goal was allowed to stand after security staff separated the players and management, and Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to defend his decision, stating that King \"stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in.\" King responded that he was \"bewildered\" by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: \"It is one of those things that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever\".
