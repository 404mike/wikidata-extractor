Before a deal could be done, he signed a short-term contract with Irish League First Division club Bangor instead. McMahon showed up well on his Bangor debut, a 3\u20130 win against Limavady United; manager Lee Doherty was complimentary about his movement. He scored his first goal for the club in the County Antrim Shield, but Bangor lost the match to amateur club East Belfast. In the next league game, Bangor only drew at home to Carrick Rangers as McMahon's 87th-minute penalty was saved."]}]}}
