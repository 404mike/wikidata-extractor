Stoke's first win of the season came away at West Bromwich Albion when Harry Davies scored the only goal in his second appearance. Again the director's ambition and determination to maintain First Division status showed through with the arrivals of Joe Kasher and Bert Ralphs to name a few.  This belated heavy expenditure on players cost the finance's dearly, but good crowds were able to cover the cost. Unfortunately relegation was not avoided and Stoke made an instant return to the Second Division.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Ralphs"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Ralphs"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["A strong new chairman emerged with the arrival in August 1924 of Mr A.

After a period of real doubt, confidence started to emerge for the 1924\u201325 season and was certainly helped by Tom Mather replacing old players with new fresh talent. Under new skipper Vic Rouse, Stoke started the season reasonably well and seemed to have the basis of a useful side with the likes of goalkeeper Bob Dixon, Bob McGrory, Alec Milne, Bert Ralphs, Harry Davies and Len Armitage in the squad.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Ralphs"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bert Ralphs"]}]}}
