A spokeswoman for Women Against Rape said,  \"We hope that some senior officers will face dismissal over this and similar cases\". The handling of Worboys' case was brought before the Independent Police Complaints Commission, who concluded that proper investigations could have prevented some of the attacks. Worboys' case was followed by criticisms about the police in connection with the equally prolific serial sex offender Kirk Reid, who escaped apprehension despite being connected with a string of sex crimes four years before his arrest."]}, {"page": "List of serial rapists", "response": ["| Kirk Reid"]}]}}
