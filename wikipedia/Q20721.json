Beethoven is regarded either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic era. Schubert is also a transitional figure, as were Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Luigi Cherubini, Gaspare Spontini, Gioachino Rossini, Carl Maria von Weber, Jan Ladislav Dussek and Niccol\u00f2 Paganini. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of Viennese Classicism (), since Gluck, Haydn, Salieri, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert all worked in Vienna.", "In the 1790s, a new generation of composers, born around 1770, emerged. While they had grown up with the earlier styles, they heard in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788 Luigi Cherubini settled in Paris and in 1791 composed Lodoiska, an opera that raised him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the grand opera. His contemporary \u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera Euphrosine et Coradin, from which followed a series of successes. The final push towards change came from Gaspare Spontini, who was deeply admired by future romantic composers such as Weber, Berlioz and Wagner. The innovative harmonic language of his operas, their refined instrumentation and their \"enchained\" closed numbers (a structural pattern which was later adopted by Weber in Euryanthe and from him handed down, through Marschner, to Wagner), formed the basis from which French and German romantic opera had its beginnings."]}, {"page": "Circe", "response": ["Rousseau's poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities. Set for mezzo-soprano and full orchestra, it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer Luigi Cherubini in 1789. Franz Seydelmann set it for soprano and full orchestra in Dresden in 1787 at the request of the Russian ambassador to the Saxon Court, Prince Alexander Belosselsky. Although he spoke highly of Seydelmann's work, it is now judged grandiloquent and banal.Jacques Chailley, \"Les dialogues sur la musique d'Alexandre Beloselskij\", Revue des \u00e9tudes slaves 45, 1966, pp. 93\u2013103.

In letters to third parties she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child,\" a \"little angel\", a \"poor angel\", a \"sufferer\", and a \"beloved little corpse.\" In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters\u00a0\u2013 a rich actress and a prince in weak health\u00a0\u2013 could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin. In Chopin's presence, Sand read the manuscript aloud to Delacroix, who was both shocked and mystified by its implications, writing that \"Madame Sand was perfectly at ease and Chopin could hardly stop making admiring comments\". That year their relationship ended following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship\". Grzyma\u0142a, who had followed their romance from the beginning, commented, \"If [Chopin] had not had the misfortune of meeting G.S. [George Sand], who poisoned his whole being, he would have lived to be Cherubini's age.\" Chopin would die two years later at thirty-nine; the composer Luigi Cherubini had died in Paris in 1842 at the age of eighty-one."]}, {"page": "March 15", "response": ["*1842 \u2013 Luigi Cherubini, Italian composer and theorist (b. 1760)"]}, {"page": "Opera", "response": ["In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of King Louis XIV. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an Academy of Music and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with Cadmus et Hermione, Lully and his librettist Quinault created trag\u00e9die en musique, a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive recitative which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was Jean-Philippe Rameau, who composed five trag\u00e9dies en musique as well as numerous works in other genres such as op\u00e9ra-ballet, all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian opera seria throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead. After Rameau's death, the German Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the Parisian stage in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: op\u00e9ra comique. This was the equivalent of the German singspiel, where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by Monsigny, Philidor and, above all, Gr\u00e9try. During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period, composers such as \u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul, Luigi Cherubini and Gaspare Spontini, who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly \"comic\" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. Gossec's Le triomphe de la R\u00e9publique (1793)."]}, {"page": "Vincenzo Bellini", "response": ["Quickly, Bellini entered the fashionable world of the Parisian salon, most importantly that run by the Italian exile Princess Belgiojoso whom he had met in Milan and who \"was by far the most overtly political of the salonni\u00e8res\". Her salon became a meeting place for Italian revolutionaries such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo, and Camillo Cavour, and it was there that he would have most likely made the acquaintance of Count Carlo Pepoli. Others that Bellini would have met included Victor Hugo, George Sand, Alexandre Dumas p\u0117re, and Heinrich Heine. Among the many musical figures were several Italian such as Michele Carafa and the imposing Luigi Cherubini, then in his seventies."]}, {"page": "1797", "response": ["* March 13 \u2013 M\u00e9d\u00e9e, an opera by Luigi Cherubini, is premiered in Paris."]}, {"page": "1842", "response": ["* March 15 \u2013 Luigi Cherubini, Italian composer (b. 1760)"]}, {"page": "1760", "response": ["* September 14 \u2013 Luigi Cherubini, Italian composer (d. 1842)"]}, {"page": "Giovanni Paisiello", "response": ["Paisiello left Russia in 1784, and, after producing Il Re Teodoro at Vienna, entered the service of Ferdinand IV of Naples, where he composed many of his best operas, including Nina and La Molinara.

Mozart had just finished a string of piano concertos, K. 449 and 453, written for his pupil Barbara Ployer. When Ployer\u2019s father arranged a performance at his summer estate in D\u00f6bling, Mozart wrote to his father, \u201cFr\u00e4ulein Babette will play her new concerto in G and I shall play the Quintet and then we\u2019ll perform together the grand sonata for two pianos.
