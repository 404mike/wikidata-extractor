She represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in the 200m butterfly swimming event, and was the 2011 World silver medalist at that distance.\nFollowing a disappointing 2012 Games, Gandy expressed an intention to swim for Australia, having lived and trained there since 2007, and served a period of ineligibility in order to do so. She represented Australia for the first time at a FINA World Cup event in Eindhoven in August 2013. Since her switch, Gandy has publicly adopted the first name Elly, the name by which she has been known privately in Australia.Under her new flag, Gandy is the current holder of the Australian and Commonwealth short-course 200m butterfly record. She remains the British long course record-holder in 100 and 200 metre butterfly, and 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carey Baptist Grammar School", "response": ["*Ellen Gandy ('10) \u2013 swimmer"]}, {"page": "2011 World Aquatics Championships", "response": ["On the fifth day of competition on July 28, five finals were contested, the men's 200\u00a0m individual medley, men's 100\u00a0m freestyle, women's 200\u00a0m butterfly, women's 50\u00a0m backstroke, and the women's 4\u00d7200\u00a0m freestyle relay.  In the first final of day five, the men's 200\u00a0m individual medley, American Ryan Lochte set the first world record of the competition en route to winning gold with a time of 1:54.00 and successfully defended his 2009 title.  After the race, Lochte said, \"All I can say is summed up in one word ... Jeah! That's really all.\" American Michael Phelps finished second in 1:54.16. In the men's 100\u00a0m freestyle, Australian James Magnussen continued his strong performance with gold in a time of 47.63, becoming the first Australian man to win the event.  After the race, Magnussen said, \"When I get back to Australia, I will be relaxing with my friends, and it will sound amazing to be called a world champion. It has been six weeks since I have gotten a good night's sleep. No Australian has won this race at the world championships before, so it is good to be in the same club as the legends of this sport.\" Defending champion C\u00e9sar Cielo finished in fourth place after fading badly the last 15 meters with a time of 48.01. In the women's 200\u00a0m butterfly, Chinese Jiao Liuyang won her first individual world title with a time of 2:05.55, just holding off Brit Ellen Gandy who finished second in 2:05.59. In the women's 50\u00a0m backstroke, Russian Anastasia Zuyeva won the gold in a time of 27.79. In the women's 4\u00d7200\u00a0m freestyle relay, the American team of Missy Franklin, Dagny Knutson, Katie Hoff, and Allison Schmitt won the gold with a time of 7:46.14.  Leading off the relay, the sixteen-year-old Franklin recorded a time of 1:55.06, which was fast enough to win the individual 200\u00a0m freestyle (won in 1:55.58).
