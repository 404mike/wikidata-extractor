During this time he produced a number of striking cover illustrations along with its distinctive, iconic logo still in use to this day. He has also worked for Marvel Comics, Deadline magazine, Manga publishing, DC Comics and Vertigo comics for whom he created the anniversary cover for VERTIGO X, a special edition celebrating ten years of DC's adult-fiction imprint.\nHis other notable work outside of the comics industry includes three album sleeves for Asian Dub Foundation (Tank, Time Freeze, A History of Now), William Orbit (Strange Cargo III) and Last Man Standing False Starts & Broken Promises, which was selected in September 2008 by Peter Saville and Dylan Jones for the London exhibition 'SPIN \u2013 The Art of Record Design'.\nMore recently, April 2010 saw Warner Bros. using Cook's comic book logo for The Losers film campaign. Steven Cook is a lecturer at the University of the Arts London.\nOver the past ten years he has produced a body of work that sees him remixing his own photography and fusing it with imagery from a bygone era. With this series 'Alternity' he creates random scenes from a parallel universe, where the boundaries of time have been compromised and liaisons between the inhabitants of different eras can occur in secret.\nExhibited in New York and London, his first show featured a live performance by writer Grant Morrison, reading a specially crafted monologue to accompany the images, with the musical accompaniment of Ysanne Spevack.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brendan McCarthy", "response": ["*Solo #12 (script and art, with Steven Cook, Howard Hallis, Jono Howard, Tom O'Connor and Robbie Morrison, DC Comics, 2006)"]}, {"page": "Steve Cook (disambiguation)", "response": ["Steve Cook, Steven Cook or Steve Cooke  may also refer to:", "* Steven Cook, British artist, photographer, and graphic designer"]}, {"page": "Stephen Cook (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Steven Cook, British artist, photographer, and graphic designer."]}, {"page": "Grant Morrison bibliography", "response": ["*Skin Two #26: \"The Story of Zero\" ('ambient, erotic' prose, with Steven Cook, Alexander Brattell and Lisa Sherman, 1987)"]}, {"page": "Steve Cook (comics)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steven Cook"]}, {"page": "2013 in comics", "response": ["* May 16\u201331: Orbital Comics (London, England, U.K.) \u2014 \"Image Duplicator\", an exhibition of cartoonists \"re-appropriating the works of Roy Lichtenstein, tracking them back to their original source material and then creating a new comic book image that credits the original artist,\" curated by Rian Hughes and Jason Atomic.
