Unfortunately for the Harlequins they only held onto Gwynn for one season, as a disastrous 1891-1892 season for Cardiff RFC, saw the team scour the lower clubs for new talent.

He played rugby on the wing for second tier team Cardiff Harlequins. The Harlequins at the time were an emerging club that showed promise in cup competitions and tour events, but had only just produced their first international player, forward Percy Bennett. Nicholls was first chosen to represent Wales in the final game of the 1892 Home Nations Championship, an away game at Lansdowne Road against Ireland. Under the captaincy of Welsh rugby legend Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Nicholls came in at threequarters on the opposite wing to Cardiff RFC, stalwart Norman Biggs as a replacement for William McCutcheon. Despite a wealth of talent the Welsh team had lost the opening two games of the Championship and the Irish and Welsh teams faced each other in an attempt to avoid bottom place. Wales lost the game 9-0 and Nicholls was replaced in the next game by a returning McCutcheon, and never represented Wales again."]}]}}
