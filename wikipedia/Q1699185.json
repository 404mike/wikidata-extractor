Today, he is considered one of the great painters of the Victorian era, as well as one of the best and most accomplished nightscape and townscape artists of all time. He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in Victorian Painting (1999).Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, allegedly also used by Caravaggio, as well as Vermeer, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\". However, many recognised his mastery of colour, lighting and shadow, as well as his unique ability to provoke strong emotional responses in the viewer. James McNeill Whistler, who Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, \"I considered myself the inventor of nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\"His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J. A. Grimshaw\", or \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", though he finally settled on \"Atkinson Grimshaw\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "River Clyde", "response": ["In the mid-19th century, engineers took on the task of a dredging of the Clyde much more extensively. They removed millions of cubic feet of silt to deepen and widen the channel. The major stumbling block encountered by that project was a massive geological intrusion known as Elderslie Rock. Because that rock increased the project's difficulty, the work was not completed until the 1880s. Around this time, the Clyde became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw and James Kay, who were interested in painting scenes that depicted the new industrial era and the modern world.", "The Clyde plays an important role in the Para Handy novels of Neil Munro, and subsequent adaptations. It also features in novels by Alasdair Gray, Matthew Fitt, and Robin Jenkins.
