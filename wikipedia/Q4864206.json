They went to court against Orlando and his company, O-Records, and successfully nullified their contract. After signing with Barry Evangeli's company, InTune Music Limited, Divine released several new disco records, including \"You Think You're A Man\" and \"I'm So Beautiful\", which were both co-produced by Pete Waterman of the then-up-and-coming UK production team of Stock Aitken Waterman. In the United Kingdom, Divine sang his hit \"You Think You're A Man\" \u2013 a song which he had dedicated to his parents \u2013 on BBC television show Top of the Pops. He gained a devout follower, Briton Mitch Whitehead, a man who declared himself Divine's \"number 1 fan\", tattooing himself with images of his idol and eventually aiding Bernard Jay in setting up for Divine's show onstage. In London, Divine also befriended drag comedy act Paul O'Grady, with Jay helping O'Grady obtain his first bookings in the U.S."]}, {"page": "Mike Stock (musician)", "response": ["Stock had briefly worked with Pete Waterman in 1980 when John Milton, Mark Stock and Mike wrote a song \u2013 \"One Nine for a Lady Breaker\" \u2013 for a CB radio club. A version of the track found its way to Pete Waterman who managed Peter Collins, then a successful producer with acts like Musical Youth and Nik Kershaw. The track was re-recorded and produced by Collins; Stock sang on the track under the alias Chris Britton. In January 1984 Stock and Aitken arranged to meet Waterman at his office in the Stiff Records building, Camden Town. Waterman was seeking a new partnership and in February 1984 they went into the Marquee Studio in Wardour Street Soho to record the song \"The Upstroke\" for 'Agents Aren't Aeroplanes'- a front for their concept of a female Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The record was released on Proto Records run by Barry Evangeli and Nick East and distributed by RCA. \"The Upstroke\" achieved popularity in the gay clubs and discos where many new records were being found and subsequently promoted into the mainstream as Hi-NRG."]}, {"page": "List of Cypriots", "response": ["* Barry Evangeli, music producer"]}, {"page": "Proto", "response": ["* Proto Records, a British record company active in the 1980s; see Barry Evangeli"]}, {"page": "List of British people of Cypriot descent", "response": ["*Barry Evangeli, music producer"]}]}}
