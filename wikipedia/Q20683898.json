According to James Bridle, Berger \"didn't just help us gain a new perspective on viewing art with his 1972 series Ways of Seeing \u2013 he also revealed much about the world in which we live. Whether exploring the history of the female nude or the status of oil paint, his landmark series showed how art revealed the social and political systems in which it was made. He also examined what had changed in our ways of seeing in the time between when the art was made and today.\""]}, {"page": "Advanced chess", "response": ["Centaur chess is sometimes invoked to argue that humans will continue to remain relevant as AI progresses. U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work invoked in 2016 the concept of \"centaur warfighting\", extending the centaur concept beyond the chess world. Tyler Cowen and others assessed in 2013 that, due to chess engine advances, it was getting difficult to see any major advantage to centaurs over computers by themselves in chess, and that it seemed unlikely that centaurs would retain a significant advantage for much longer. In contrast, as recently as 2017, Kasparov has stated that, given an appropriate operator, he is confident that a centaur team could outperform the top supercomputers, while James Bridle states in 2018 that \"an average player paired with an average computer is capable of beating the most sophisticated supercomputer\"."]}, {"page": "Londonstani", "response": ["The plot, and especially the ending, was praised by some and severely criticized by others. Tim Martin praised the \"shattering twist that maintains total narrative cogency while turning the entire book upside down,\" but Suhayl Saadi calls it \"contrived and unconvincing\" and complains of a \"clunky\" plot. James Bridle, on ReadySteadyBook, agrees, in an otherwise positive review: \"The less said about the final twist, which smacks of rushed, massive-advance-mediated desperation, the better.\" Mandy Sayer, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, praises the novel for exuding a \"charming, original energy\" but criticizes \"the surprise ending and resolution [which] is disappointing, clich\u00e9d and trite.\" Her overall conclusion: \"As a contemporary cultural artefact, Londonstani is second to none.
