The Volunteers took part in the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, and the War of Independence that followed the Declaration of Independence by the revolutionary parliament D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 1919, during which they came to be known as the IRA. Ireland was partitioned into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and following the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 Southern Ireland, renamed the Irish Free State, became a self-governing dominion while Northern Ireland chose to remain under home rule as part of the United Kingdom. The Treaty caused a split in the IRA, the pro-Treaty IRA were absorbed into the National Army, which defeated the anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War. Subsequently, while denying the legitimacy of the Free State, the surviving elements of the anti-Treaty IRA focused on overthrowing the Northern Ireland state and the achievement of a united Ireland, carrying out a bombing campaign in England in 1939 and 1940, a campaign in Northern Ireland in the 1940s, and the Border campaign of 1956\u20131962. Following the failure of the Border campaign, internal debate took place regarding the future of the IRA. Chief-of-staff Cathal Goulding wanted the IRA to adopt a socialist agenda and become involved in politics, while traditional republicans such as Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in wanted to increase recruitment and rebuild the IRA."]}, {"page": "Sinn F\u00e9in", "response": ["At the 1955 United Kingdom general election, two Sinn F\u00e9in candidates were elected to Westminster, and likewise, four members of Sinn F\u00e9in were elected to Leinster House in the 1957 Irish general election.

Through the 1960s, some leading figures in the movement, such as Cathal Goulding, Se\u00e1n Garland, Billy McMillen, Tom\u00e1s Mac Giolla, moved steadily to the left, even to Marxism, as a result of their own reading and thinking and contacts with the Irish and international left. This angered more traditional republicans, who wanted to stick to the national question and armed struggle. The Garland Commission was set up in 1967, to investigate the possibility of ending abstentionism. Its report angered the already disaffected traditional republican element within the party, notably Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in and Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, who viewed such a policy as treason against the Irish Republic.Robert William White, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh: the life and politics of an Irish revolutionary, p. 119."]}, {"page": "1972", "response": ["* November 19 \u2013 Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, a leader of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, is arrested in Dublin after giving an interview to RT\u00c9."]}, {"page": "Edward Heath", "response": ["Heath governed during a bloody period in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles.

Senior IRSP member Michael Plunkett was arrested after Gardai found bomb-making equipment in his flat in Dublin and later jumped bail and fled to Paris. A series of botched Middle East arms importations attempts precipitated tensions between Belfast and Dublin representatives to the INLA GHQ and Dessie Grew considered assassinating the leader of the Belfast faction opposed to the INLA chief of staff. Before the conflict broke out there were attempts to recruit veteran Provisional IRA leader Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in as INLA chief of staff in the hope he would help stabilise the organisation. He was interested and met with INLA Army Council representatives on several occasions between 1978 and 1979 but nothing materialised. The unauthorised kidnapping of a Dublin bank manager from his home in January 1980 led to further internal anger and an operation in England was planned to demonstrate that the INLA was still capable of carrying on its war. An INLA Active service unit planted two 10 lb bombs at Netheravon British Army camp in Salisbury Plain.
