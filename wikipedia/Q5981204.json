Matthews Southern Comfort (without the apostrophe) were not yet a band at that stage and Matthews was not yet ready to go solo so the title was an all embracing attempt to encompass an album title and the collective of musicians that made it. As Matthews told author Ian Clayton in one of the interviews for their co-written 2018 book Thro\u2019 My Eyes: A Memoir, Personal communication from Ian Clayton, co-author of Matthews' 2018 biography, Thro' My Eyes: Notes from interviews during book preparation \"it got me out of the dilemma of not wanting to go solo and it sounded like a band name\". The album took its name from a song that Matthews liked, \"Southern Comfort\" by the Canadian folk duo Ian & Sylvia.", "Chart success and its attendant media coverage and obligations did not, however, sit at all easily with Matthews,  nor did the increasing spectre of being labelled as a country rock band. His discontent came to a head in late November 1970 at the soundcheck for a gig in Birmingham where he abruptly quit there and then and returned home to London.Personal communication from Ian Clayton, co-author of Matthews' 2018 biography, Thro' My Eyes: \"Iain recalled it being a Friday in late November\" His decision to leave became hot news in the UK music press, even making the front page of the weekly music paper Disc and Music Echo on 28 November 1970.", "* Iain Matthews with Ian Clayton: Thro' My Eyes: A Memoir, Route Publishing, 2018; "]}]}}
