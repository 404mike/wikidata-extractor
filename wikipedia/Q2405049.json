He joined Inverness CT in 2000 after being released by Kilmarnock, then signed for Queen of the South in 2003 after again being released. He also played St Johnstone, Raith Rovers, Dumbarton and Irvine Meadow. He signed for Hurlford United in January 2009.

McCabe promised a more attacking approach differing from the defensive style that Martin had employed. He also had the difficult but widely expected task of gaining promotion after only one season in the Scottish Third Division. McCabe signed former Kilmarnock Scottish Cup winner David Bagan and Stephen Dobbie on loan from St Johnstone. Dobbie scored 10 goals in 17 league games which pushed Dumbarton into a high league position. However Dobbie's loan spell ended in December 2006. Any chances of a loan extension were dashed when Dobbie signed permanently for Scottish First Division side Queen of the South. After Dobbie's departure the goals dried up and Dumbarton just fell short of a promotion play-off place and finished in fifth place. McCabe succeeded in leading Dumbarton to a Scottish Cup 3rd round tie against SPL champions Celtic which they lost 4\u20130. McCabe also led Dumbarton to a League Cup clash against another SPL team, Inverness Caley Thistle eventually losing the match 3\u20131."]}, {"page": "1997 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|MF |||| David Bagan || || "]}, {"page": "Bagan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*David Bagan (born 1977), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  David Bagan"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  David Bagan"]}, {"page": "Bagan, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Bagan"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["|  David Bagan"]}]}}
