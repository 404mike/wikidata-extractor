He resigned from the Labour Party Shadow Cabinet in November 2014 to focus on his campaign. The Guardian's Kevin McKenna argued Murphy's tour during the 2014 referendum campaign \"wasn't really about his new-found enthusiasm for the union... [but] was, instead, a three-month job interview for the post of leader of the Labour party in Scotland\". In announcing his candidacy, Murphy stated he would end the electoral losing streak of Labour in Scotland, creating a revival similar to Tony Blair's return to power in 1997 in the UK. On 13 December 2014, Murphy was elected as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, having secured 56% of the vote under the party's electoral college system."]}, {"page": "Pete Wishart", "response": ["In 2016 he was condemned after tweeting that supporters of Tony Blair were \"now like an embarrassing incontinent old relative who you might go and visit occasionally.\u201d Labour MSP Neil Findlay said the remark was \"totally unacceptable for an elected MP to mock elderly people in care homes or patients suffering the misery of incontinence\" and Wishart deleted the tweet."]}, {"page": "Nicola Sturgeon", "response": ["Sturgeon has also campaigned on women's rights and gender equality, and is a self-described feminist; she has argued that Scotland's feminist movement is not simply symbolic, but \"sends a powerful signal about equality\". She has hailed Scottish feminist economist Ailsa McKay as one of her inspirations. She has at various points commented on the behaviour or attitudes of men towards women; publicly condemning Donald Trump, Tony Abbott and former Labour MSP Neil Findlay. She has also defended men from allegations of sexism too; in 2015, after Alex Salmond told Tory MP Anna Soubry, \"Behave yourself, woman\", Sturgeon said: \"The fundamental question, \u2018does that language indicate that Alex Salmond is sexist?\u2019 Absolutely not, there\u2019s no man I know who is less sexist.\u201d Commenting on the need for men to challenge their friends\u2019 misogynistic behaviour, Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament in 2021: \"I would say to all men in this chamber and all men across the country \u2014 challenge it [misogyny] if it\u2019s on the part of other men you may know, challenge your own behaviour and then let\u2019s collectively, as a society, turn the page and turn the corner so that women can live free of the fear of harassment, abuse, intimidation, violence and, in the worst cases, death.\""]}, {"page": "Shona Robison", "response": ["In January 2018, during an appearance at Holyrood's Health and Sport Committee, she was warned by Labour MSP Neil Findlay of a \"drugs disaster\".

She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland, and treated Scottish Labour \"like a branch office of London.\" She described some London-based colleagues as \"dinosaurs\" unable to understand that \"Scotland has changed forever\" following the referendum. Lamont was also angry that she had not been consulted on some matters, such as a decision by the UK leadership to replace Ian Price as Scottish Labour's General Secretary. In her letter of resignation, submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin, Lamont accused \"senior members of the party\" of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself \"out of the equation\" to allow Scottish Labour to have a discussion about the best way forward. Anas Sarwar became Labour's acting leader. On 26 October, following a meeting of the party's executive committee, he outlined the details of a leadership election, which would be held using the three-tier electoral college, and conclude with the announcement of a new leader on 13 December. Murphy, Boyack and Neil Findlay stood in the subsequent contest, with Murphy elected as Lamont's successor. Lamont did not vote for Murphy in the election, but instead chose to back his rivals."]}]}}
