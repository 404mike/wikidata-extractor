MacKenzie later said that the band recorded the Bowie song \"to prove the point. It was a strange way of proving it, but it worked. People said, 'That is awful. How dare they!'\" The ensuing attention earned them a contract with Fiction Records, and their debut album, The Affectionate Punch, followed on 1 August 1980. By this time the duo of Mackenzie and Rankine had been joined by bassist Michael Dempsey and drummer John Murphy, though in most promotional material the group were still marketed as a duo.", "Before Mackenzie's death, almost all Associates records had been deleted. Former band member Michael Dempsey and the MacKenzie estate began a reissue programme to make sure the band's legacy continued, reissuing almost every Associates album, including a 25th anniversary edition of The Affectionate Punch in 2005. In addition to the original albums, two compilation albums were released: Double Hipness (2000), a collection of early tracks with the 1993 reunion demos; and Singles (2004), an extended version of Popera \u2013 The Singles Collection which caught up with post-1990 material and included the cover of Bowie's \"Boys Keep Swinging\".

According to Smith, \"four other kids\" beat him up after school, although Jeff Apter notes that Smith has given several conflicting versions of the story.

He remarked, \"It was called the Crawley Goat Band \u2013 brilliant!\" However, while the Crawley Goat Band may have been Smith's first regular group, he would have been just 13 when he and his Notre Dame schoolmates gave their first one-off performance together as The Obelisk, an early incarnation of what would eventually become The Cure. The Obelisk featured Smith (still playing piano at this point) alongside Marc Ceccagno (lead guitar), Michael Dempsey (guitar), Alan Hill (bass), and Laurence \"Lol\" Tolhurst (percussion) and, according to The Cure's official biography Ten Imaginary Years, gave their only performance at a school function in April 1972.

Smith said that \"the group\" eventually became Malice, \"sort of a sub-metal punk group -with Michael Dempsey, Laurence and two other blokes.\" According to the band's Ten Imaginary Years biography, between January and December 1976, the shifting line-up for Malice featured several \"other blokes\", with founding guitarist Marc Ceccagno being replaced by Porl Thompson, an early drummer known only as \"Graham\" replaced by Lol Tolhurst, and \"Graham's brother\" replaced by vocalist Martin Creasy. By 1977, Malice had become Easy Cure.", "By the time the NME interviewed the band in October 1979 during their tour with Siouxsie and the Banshees, Smith was acknowledged as the principal writer of \"almost all of The Cure's songs and lyrics\", and stated that he was uncomfortable playing and singing songs that weren't his own.Pearson, Deanne, \"No Image, No Style, No Bullshit\", NME, 6 October 1979. Following his return from the Banshees' tour, Smith also composed most of the music for the album Seventeen Seconds using the Hammond, a drum machine and his trademark Top 20 Woolworth's guitar, during a home demo session in his parents' basement.

The album marked the first time frontman Robert Smith co-produced with Mike Hedges. After the departure of original bassist Michael Dempsey, Simon Gallup became an official member along with keyboardist Matthieu Hartley. The single \"A Forest\" was the band's first entry in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart.", "At the end of the Cure's 1979 UK tour supporting Siouxsie and the Banshees, Robert Smith spoke less and less with bassist Michael Dempsey. Early versions of \"Play for Today\" and \"M\" had been performed at a few concerts, but Dempsey did not like the new musical direction that Smith wanted to take. Smith commented: \"I think the final straw came when I played Michael the demos for the next album and he hated them. He wanted us to be XTC part 2 and \u2013 if anything \u2013 I wanted us to be the Banshees part 2. So he left\". Playing guitar with the Banshees for two months and learning their songs opened up another horizon to Smith. \"It allowed me to think beyond what we were doing. I wanted to have a band that does what Steven Severin and Budgie do, where they just get a bassline and the drum part and Siouxsie wails\". The records to which Smith was frequently listening during the composition of the album were Five Leaves Left by Nick Drake, Isle of Wight by Jimi Hendrix, Astral Weeks by Van Morrison and Low by David Bowie. Smith wrote the lyrics and music for most of the record at his parents' home, on a Hammond organ with a built-in tape recorder. Interviewed in 2004, producer Mike Hedges did not recall any demo tracks, with the band generally playing the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added."]}, {"page": "Crawley", "response": ["*The Cure were formed in Crawley in 1976 by Robert Smith, Michael Dempsey and Lol Tolhurst, all of whom attended St Wilfrid's RC School."]}, {"page": "Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)", "response": ["* Michael Dempsey \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Killing an Arab", "response": ["* Michael Dempsey \u2013 bass guitar", "Category:Songs written by Michael Dempsey"]}, {"page": "Greatest Hits (The Cure album)", "response": ["*Michael Dempsey\u00a0- bass guitar (track 1)"]}, {"page": "Standing on a Beach", "response": ["#\"Killing an Arab\" (Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst, Michael Dempsey) \u2013 2:22"]}, {"page": "Concert: The Cure Live", "response": ["#\"10:15 Saturday Night\" (Smith, Michael Dempsey, Tolhurst) \u2013 3:44"]}]}}
