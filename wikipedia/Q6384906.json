With the TARDIS trapped in a tomb, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) is mistaken for a female reincarnation of the ancient high priest Yetaxa, and assumes her guise and identity. From her new position of power, Barbara sees her chance to bring an end to human sacrifice. She sees the good side of Aztec culture manifested in Autloc (Keith Pyott), the High Priest of Knowledge, and the gruesome side embodied in the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl (John Ringham). As a history teacher, she sees how advanced their culture really is and believes that if sacrifice were abolished, they would be spared destruction at the hands of the Spanish. The urgent warnings of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) that Barbara cannot change history fall on deaf ears, much to his fury.", "Keith Pyott was chosen for the role of Autloc, the High Priest of the Aztecs, while Ian Cullen and Margot Van der Burgh played Ixta and Cameca, respectively. Cullen recalled that William Hartnell \"wasn't the friendliest person, but he was trying to remember all those lines\". John Ringham, an old colleague of Crockett, was chosen to play Tlotoxl; for the character, Crockett told Ringham to \"make all the children in the country hate you\". Crockett's secretary June McMullen suggested Walter Randall for the role of Tonila, having met him at a party. Producer Verity Lambert required Randall to shave his face for the role. Martial arts expert David Anderson, who had previously appeared in Marco Polo, was cast as the Captain of the Guard. Anderson also arranged the fight between Ian and Ixta for the second episode, and acted as William Russell's stunt double in the final episode. Lucarotti used Aztec-sounding names for the characters; for example, the character Ixta was derived from the Aztec city Ixtapalapa."]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["The Reluctant Romeo (2 August 1966) starring Leslie Crowther, Amanda Barrie, Keith Pyott and Sheila Steafel"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Mora NicholsonKenneth GriffithMarius GoringPeter HawkinsHoward LangHarry LittlewoodKeith Pyott"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Edward Woodward,Ronald Fraser,Vivian Pickles,Paul Hardwick,James Villiers,Donald Layne-Smith,Trader Faulkner,Tim Preece,Nicholas Hawtrey,David Savile,Clifford Cox,Jimmy Gardner,Keith Pyott,Esmond Webb,Richard Hampton,Denis McCarthy"]}, {"page": "The Colditz Story", "response": ["* Keith Pyott as French colonel"]}, {"page": "Village of the Damned (1960 film)", "response": ["* Keith Pyott as Dr. Carlisle"]}, {"page": "Chimes at Midnight", "response": ["*Keith Pyott as the Lord Chief Justice"]}, {"page": "The Phantom of the Opera (1962 film)", "response": ["* Keith Pyott as Weaver"]}, {"page": "Michael Culver", "response": ["*The Master Builder by Henrik Ibsen, Translated by Michael Meyer, The New Arts Theatre Club, 1962.
