His honours with the club in this period include: winners medals in the Midland Floodlight Cup, Staffordshire Senior Cup and FA Trophy; a Northern Premier League Shield runners-up medal; a Northern Premier League runners-up medal in 1970\u201371, and a Northern Premier League champions medal in 1971\u201372. He then went into the Football League with Port Vale after the club paid Rangers \u00a33,000 in May 1974. Spending four years with the Vale, he played 190 games in league and cup, and finished as the club's joint-top scorer in 1974\u201375.
