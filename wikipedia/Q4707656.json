After less than a month of his tenure, Hart made his entire squad available for transfer, after being informed he had to drastically reduce the wage bill to avoid the club going into financial ruin. As a result, Hart lost several experienced and key players, notably Andy Johnson to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a3200,000, Alan Rogers to Leicester City for an undisclosed fee, and Stern John to Birmingham City for \u00a3100,000."]}, {"page": "Skelmersdale United F.C.", "response": ["Exits at the first stage of the cup competitions, coupled by an exodus of the playing staff over the festive period after a cut in the playing budget then led to a change in the backroom in January 2017 with long serving manager Tommy Lawson sacked, his assistants and a number of players exiting with him through loyalty, going on to re-unite later in the season at Marine AFC. Alan Rogers took charge in February and working with a very youthful squad, he was unable to prevent the drop to the division below but did so with a fighting spirit that saw United claim some good results against sides who would finish in the upper echelons of the table.", "Ahead of their first season in Northern Premier League Division One North since 2013, United brought in a number of experienced players in pre-season, Danny Ventre, Richard Brodie, Andy Owens, Steven Gillespie and Gareth Roberts to bolster a young squad. A mixed start to the 2017-18 season saw one win in the opening nine league games with an exit in the First Qualifying round of the FA Cup. Alan Rogers departed as manager on 20 September citing other work commitments. Dave Powell was appointed manager on 24 September."]}]}}
