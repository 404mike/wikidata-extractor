The estate had presumably belonged to the Diocese of Dorchester, of which Remigius had been consecrated bishop in 1070. The see of Dorchester had been absorbed into that of Lincoln in 1072, and Remigius had been translated to Lincoln as bishop of the newly united diocese.  The Domesday Book lists two water mills in the parish. By the time of the Hundred Rolls in 1279 there was a third watermill and in about 1500 there was a fourth mill. There is no known subsequent record of the third and fourth mills, but both of the others seem to have survived until the 17th century and in at least one case the 18th century. By the end of 19th century both mills were disused.  Great Milton had a post mill with four sails. In about 1901 Henry Taunt photographed it, by which time it had lost one pair of sails and appeared derelict. In 1762 a fire destroyed 16 houses in the village.  By 1822 the parish had at least three public houses: the Bell, the Bull and the Red Lion. The Bell and the Red Lion had both ceased trading by the 1990s. Greene King Brewery controlled The Bull until 2013, when 110 villagers including chef Raymond Blanc bought it and turned it into a community pub."]}, {"page": "Ancient Order of Druids", "response": ["* Henry Taunt, photographer (1842\u20131922)"]}, {"page": "High Street, Oxford", "response": ["Edward Bracher, a pioneering Victorian photographer, had a shop at 26 High Street.
