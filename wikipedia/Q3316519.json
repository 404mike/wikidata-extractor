She is a wealthy spinster, once jilted at the altar, who insists on wearing her wedding dress for the rest of her life. She lives in a ruined mansion with her adopted daughter, Estella. Dickens describes her as looking like \"the witch of the place\".\nAlthough she has often been portrayed in film versions as very elderly, Dickens's own notes indicate that she is only in her mid-thirties at the start of the novel. However, it is indicated in the novel that her long life without sunlight has aged her. She is one of the most gothic characters in the work of Dickens.", "link_mentions": {}}}
