Tavor and others in the unit resolved to take justice into their own hands and pay back the Germans for the atrocities the German army had committed. Using whatever information they could find, they tracked down Germans who, they believed, had participated in killing Jews, and then - wearing British Military Police uniforms they had acquired to give the misleading impression they were conducting an official inquiry - took their captives to isolated places in the forests and executed them, usually by strangulation. Tavor stated, a year or so before his death, that he did not \"regret\" committing murder without a proper trial, he only regretted what they \"didn't do\" to their victims.\nIn 1960, Moshe Tavor was part of the Israeli team that kidnapped (using subterfuge and in direct contravention of the applicable laws) former SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann, who was hiding in Argentina. Eichmann, who had coordinated much of the \"Final Solution\", was brought to Israel, where he was placed on trial and convicted for crimes against the Jewish people, sentenced to death, and executed on 1 June 1962.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jewish Brigade", "response": ["* Moshe Tavor"]}]}}
