In 1868, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, who convinced Schliemann that Troy was a real city at what is now Hisarlik in Turkey. On the basis of excavations conducted by Schliemann and others, this claim is now accepted by most scholars.In the second edition of his In Search of the Trojan War, Michael Wood notes developments that were made in the intervening ten years since his first edition was published. Scholarly skepticism about Schliemann's identification has been dispelled by the more recent archaeological discoveries, linguistic research, and translations of clay-tablet records of contemporaneous diplomacy.

Wood also suggests that \u00c6thelstan may have been the first English king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual, and that John was probably his tutor.Wood, In Search of England, p. 157; Wood, \"Stand strong against the monsters\", p. 199; Wood, \"A Carolingian Scholar in the Court of King \u00c6thelstan\", p. 137 However, Sarah Foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better sense if it is dated to the beginning of \u00c6thelstan's reign.Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, pp. 32, 110\u2013112", "In 934 Olaf Guthfrithson succeeded his father Guthfrith as the Norse King of Dublin. The alliance between the Norse and the Scots was cemented by the marriage of Olaf to Constantine's daughter. By August 937 Olaf had defeated his rivals for control of the Viking part of Ireland, and he promptly launched a bid for the former Norse kingdom of York. Individually Olaf and Constantine were too weak to oppose \u00c6thelstan, but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of Wessex. In the autumn they joined with the Strathclyde Britons under Owain to invade England. Medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer, and \u00c6thelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year. He seems to have been slow to react, and an old Latin poem preserved by William of Malmesbury accused him of having \"languished in sluggish leisure\". The allies plundered English territory while \u00c6thelstan took his time gathering a West Saxon and Mercian army. However, historian Michael Wood praises his caution, arguing that unlike Harold in 1066, he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action. When he marched north, the Welsh did not join him, and they did not fight on either side.Higham, The Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 193; Livingston, \"The Roads to Brunanburh\", pp. 13\u201318; 23; Wood, In Search of England, p. 166; Wood, In Search of the Dark Ages, p. 158", "Foreign contemporaries described him in panegyrical terms.

Michael Wood titled an essay, \"The Making of King Aethelstan's Empire: an English Charlemagne?\", and described him as \"the most powerful ruler that Britain had seen since the Romans\".Wood, \"The Making of King Aethelstan's Empire\", p. 250 In the view of Veronica Ortenberg, he was \"the most powerful ruler in Europe\" with an army that had repeatedly defeated the Vikings; continental rulers saw him as a Carolingian emperor, who \"was clearly treated as the new Charlemagne\".

David Dumville goes so far as to dismiss William's account entirely, regarding him as a \"treacherous witness\" whose account is unfortunately influential.Dumville, Wessex and England, pp. 146, 168 However, Sarah Foot is inclined to accept Michael Wood's argument that William's chronicle draws on a lost life of \u00c6thelstan.

In Keynes's view he \"has long been regarded, with good reason, as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century\u00a0... he has also been hailed as the first king of England, as a statesman of international standing\".Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 356; Keynes, \"England, c. 900\u20131016\", p. 466 David Dumville describes \u00c6thelstan as \"the father of mediaeval and modern England\",Dumville, Wessex and England, p. 171 while Michael Wood regards Offa, Alfred, and \u00c6thelstan as the three greatest Anglo-Saxon kings, and \u00c6thelstan as \"one of the more important lay intellectuals in Anglo-Saxon history\".Wood, In Search of the Dark Ages, p. 7; Wood, \"Stand strong against the monsters\", p. 192", "According to Michael Wood: \"Among all the great rulers of British history, \u00c6thelstan today is the forgotten man\",Wood, \"Aethelstan: The First King of England\" and in medieval historian Ann Williams's view: \"If \u00c6thelstan has not had the reputation which accrued to his grandfather, the fault lies in the surviving sources; \u00c6thelstan had no biographer, and the Chronicle for his reign is scanty.

Assyrians then used siege machines with animal names that were often covered with dampened horse hides to protect against flaming arrows; it is possible that the Trojan Horse was such.Michael Wood, in his book \"In search of the Trojan war\"  (which was shown on BBC TV as a series) Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, wrote in his book Description of Greece, \"That the work of Epeius was a contrivance to make a breach in the Trojan wall is known to everybody who does not attribute utter silliness to the Phrygians\"; by the Phrygians, he meant the Trojans.", "Pictorial representations of the Trojan Horse earlier than, or contemporary to, the first literary appearances of the episode can help clarify what was the meaning of the story as perceived by its contemporary audience. There are few ancient (before 480 BC) depictions of the Trojan Horse surviving. The earliest is on a Boeotian fibula dating from about 700 BC. Other early depictions are found on two relief pithoi from the Greek islands Mykonos and Tinos, both generally dated between 675 and 650 BC. The one from Mykonos (see figure) is known as the Mykonos vase. Historian Michael Wood dates the Mykonos vase to the eighth century BC, before the written accounts attributed by tradition to Homer, and posits this as evidence that the story of the Trojan Horse existed before those accounts were written. Other archaic representations of the Trojan horse are found on a Corinthian aryballos dating back to 560 BC (see figure), on a vase fragment to 540 BC (see figure), and on an Etruscan carnelian scarab."]}, {"page": "Battle of Badon", "response": ["Susan Hirst, Geoffrey Ashe and Michael Wood argue for the site of Liddington Castle on the hill above Badbury (Old English: Baddan byrig) in Wiltshire.

However historian Michael Wood has found an \"idiosyncratic\" verse in the Theobald adaptation which he believes could only have been written by Shakespeare.

As \"Double Falsehood\" is substantially shorter than any other play of Shakespeare's and is completely lacking in a subplot, which all other Shakespearean plays have, it is likely that one of Theobald's revisions was to remove a subplot from his manuscript version.

The documentary's companion book further states that one can still see a \"mezuzah on the door frame, and the candelabrum in the living room\".  Similarly, in the documentary Quest for the Lost Tribes, by the Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici, the film crew visits the home of an elderly Kaifeng Jew who describes the recent history of the Kaifeng Jews, shows some old photographs, and shows his identity papers which state that he is a member of the Jewish ethnic group. A recent documentary, Minyan in Kaifeng, covers the present-day Kaifeng Jewish community in China during a trip to Kaifeng which was taken by Jewish expatriates who met for weekly Friday night services in Beijing; upon learning about the Jews of Kaifeng, the members of the expatriate Jewish community decided to travel to Kaifeng in order to meet some of the descendants of the Kaifeng Jews and hold a Shabbat service."]}, {"page": "List of William Shakespeare screen adaptations", "response": ["* In Search of Shakespeare (TV, UK, 2003): A BBC documentary series of four 1-hour episodes, chronicling the life of William Shakespeare, written and presented by Michael Wood."]}]}}
