During his time there, he unknowingly captured a serial killer.  Leslie one night arrested a man and prepared to bring him in for questioning.  The man started crying and asked to reach into his pocket for a handkerchief.  Leslie told the man to wait until they returned to the station and brought him in.  It was found out later that the pocket did not contain a handkerchief.  Rather, there was a straight razor the man intended to use on Leslie to get away.\n(Both stories that have been added will be extremely difficult to verify.  They are both personal stories told to me by Jeff back in the mid 1980s)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeffers", "response": ["* Leslie Jeffers (1910\u20132000), English wrestler"]}, {"page": "Wrestling at the 1936 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's freestyle middleweight", "response": ["| Jaroslav Sysel ||  || Decision, 2\u20131 || Leslie Jeffers || ", "| 9 ||align=left| Leslie Jeffers ||align=left|  || 0 || 2 || 2", "| Leslie Jeffers ||  || Decision, 2\u20131 || Terry Evans || ", "| 7 ||align=left| Leslie Jeffers ||align=left|  || 2 || 1 || 3", "| \u00c9mile Poilv\u00e9 ||  || Fall || Leslie Jeffers || ", "| 9 ||align=left| Leslie Jeffers ||align=left|  || 3 || 3 || 6"]}, {"page": "England at the 1938 British Empire Games", "response": ["| Leslie Jeffers        ||   27  ||   Policeman  ||1 x bronze"]}]}}
