He began his career as a junior with Everton, turning professional in March 1951. Over the next three seasons, after suffering several injuries, he failed to make the first team at Goodison Park, and in July 1954 moved to Torquay United. His league debut came at right back on 22 September 1954 against Shrewsbury Town at Plainmoor, but he finally got his break towards the end of the season when he replaced Harry Smith at left back, playing the final 11 games of the season.\nHe began the following season as first choice, but had to share the spot with Bill Towers and Smith, making 24 appearances as the Gulls finished in fifth place. He scored on the opening day of the following season, netting the first in a 4\u20131 home win against Ipswich Town on 18 August 1956, but suffered a serious injury in the same game, and this proved to be his only appearance of the season as Torquay went on to lose out in the final table to Ipswich on goal average, Smith regaining his place in the side as regular left-back. Returning the following season from injury he made just three more appearances for Torquay before leaving league football in 1959 to join Dover FC helping them to victory in the Kent Senior Cup that season. He subsequently played for Hastings United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Smith (footballer, born 1932)", "response": ["He made his Torquay debut in a 3\u20131 win away to Walsall on 5 December 1953, with the regular left-back Jimmy Drinkwater out of the side. He initially lost his place when Drinkwater returned, but after two games out of the side, regained his place, Drinkwater switching to right-back as the on-loan Harry Parfitt missed out. He began the following season as the regular left-back in the Torquay side, playing in the FA Cup 4th round tie at home to Huddersfield Town in front of a record crowd of 21,908, which Huddersfield won 1\u20130.
