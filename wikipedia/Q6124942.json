Torquay had finished seventh in the league, and had beaten fourth placed Shrewsbury Town by a 2\u20130 aggregate scoreline in the semi-final on their way to the final. The final was hosted at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium due to the UEFA Champions League 2011 final being held at Wembley Stadium. The game ended 1\u20130 to Stevenage, meaning the club had earned back-to-back promotions in their first ever season in the Football League. Stevenage dominated the first half and forged a number of chances \u2013 Craig Reid's shot was blocked following good work from Darius Charles, and Charles himself had a header tipped over the crossbar. Just five minutes before the interval, Stevenage took the lead through John Mousinho, who had missed the club's three previous games due to suspension. Mousinho picked the ball up 40 yards out and ran at the Torquay defence before beating goalkeeper Scott Bevan with a drilled shot from 25 yards out. Torquay improved in the second half and dominated the second period, Billy Kee was denied by Chris Day on two separate occasions, while Jake Robinson saw his 20-yard effort skim off the crossbar.

This was despite of the sale of leading goalscorer Elliot Benyon to Swindon and the fact that the Gulls were docked one point by the Football League for fielding loan signing Jake Robinson while still ineligible to play.  Torquay saw off their semi-final opponents Shrewsbury Town with relative ease to set up a League Two play-off final clash with Stevenage.  However, the Gulls' season was ultimately to end in disappointment with a 1\u20130 defeat in the final and the departure of manager Paul Buckle for Bristol Rovers just two days afterwards.", "Just two days after the huge disappointment of the Crawley game, the last day of the January transfer window finally saw the departure of top striker Elliot Benyon to Swindon.  Benyon had been one of Paul Buckle's first signings when he took over at Plainmoor in 2007, and had now developed into Torquay's main goal threat.  As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans.  The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings\u2019 loan deal with Wolves.  In their place came striker Jake Robinson and midfielder Craig Stanley on loan deals from Shrewsbury and Morecambe respectively.  With a new-look squad and just the league to concentrate on, Torquay had to now put an ultimately disheartening month behind them and look to the future.", "When new loan signing Jake Robinson scored after ten minutes of his debut against Hereford on the first day of the month, Torquay United looked set to put the misery of their FA Cup exit behind them.  However, even before the game had reached half time, it was made known to Paul Buckle that Robinson's registration had not been completed before the required deadline and was actually ineligible to play in the fixture.  With the possibility of any points won from the match being deducted by the FA, Buckle was unable to prevent the demoralised Gulls from slipping to a 3\u20131 defeat. Incredibly, it emerged days later that Hereford had also fielded an ineligible player in the same game, with midfielder Rob Purdie\u2019s registration also not being completed in time for the match.", "With Torquay now having to wait for a decision on any punishment from the FA, the club had to make the most of a busy February schedule which included a further six League Two encounters following the disastrous Hereford game.  The first three were against teams battling relegation and the Gulls took full advantage, grabbing maximum points against struggling Stockport, Barnet and Burton Albion.  These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.  With loan players Jake Robinson and Craig Stanley fitting seamlessly into the new-look squad, Torquay were further enhanced by another loan signing in Northampton midfielder Ryan Gilligan.", "In a month with a punishing eight matches to be played, Torquay had to be at full strength if they were to make any kind of push for promotion.  With that in mind, Paul Buckle once again dipped into the loan market.  Although current loanee Ryan Gilligan unfortunately had to make an early return to Northampton following a family bereavement, Buckle was able to make an immediate replacement in the form of young Derby midfielder Ben Pringle.  Shortly afterwards, Plainmoor also saw the arrival of two loan strikers in Ronan Murray from Ipswich Town and Gavin Tomlin of Dagenham & Redbridge.   With Buckle eventually negotiating for both forwards to remain with Torquay until the end of the season, the Gulls now had a variety of attacking options with the likes of Jake Robinson, Chris Zebroski, Eunan O\u2019Kane and Billy Kee already causing problems to opposition defences.", "The saga regarding the fielding of the unregistered Jake Robinson in the February match against Hereford was finally resolved with Torquay receiving a one-point deduction and a \u00a310,000 fine.  With Hereford playing the equally ineligible Rob Purdie in the same match, they were also fined \u00a310,000 and deducted the three points they had gained from the match. While it could be argued that, having lost a point they had never gained in the first place, the Gulls were more harshly treated than the Bulls, Torquay decided not to appeal against the Football League's ruling.", "Torquay's play-off semi-final opponents turned out to be Shrewsbury who missed out on automatic promotion by just one point.  With the first leg at Plainmoor in front of the Sky Sports cameras, the Shrews were no doubt mindful of the 5\u20130 thrashing they had received at the Gulls\u2019 home ground just two months previously.  The fact that two of those goals came from Jake Robinson (on loan from Shrewsbury) added extra spice to the tie, particularly as there was no clause preventing Robinson from playing against his parent club in the play-offs.  Despite Robinson not getting on the score sheet, Torquay produced an assured performance which saw them comfortably win the first leg 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Chris Zebroski and Eunan O\u2019Kane.  The Gulls had to make sure they finished off the job in the return leg and that is exactly what they did with a 0\u20130 draw at the New Meadow.  The draw meant that Torquay United had done enough to ensure their place in the play-off final where the opponents would be their old Conference rivals Stevenage, who secured their own spot thanks to a 3\u20130 aggregate win over Accrington Stanley.", "Top of Ling's list of priorities was to start building a new team.  With players reaching the end of their contracts and loan players returning to their parent clubs, the squad was now starting to look rather threadbare.  Several key players who had got Torquay to the play-off final would definitely not be at the club for the new season.  Player of the year, Guy Branston made a move to Bradford City while Scott Bevan decided to join Paul Buckle at Bristol Rovers.  Torquay fans were also disappointed to see midfielder Craig Stanley, who had been particularly impressive for the Gulls on his loan spell from Morecambe, also follow Buckle to the Memorial Stadium.  Meanwhile, another loan player who would not be returning to Plainmoor was Jake Robinson who agreed to join Northampton Town instead.", "|5 || FW ||  || 9 || Jake Robinson || 7 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 7", "|Jake Robinson"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|10||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jake Robinson"]}, {"page": "Callum Davies", "response": ["On 27 March 2014, Davies joined Dover Athletic on loan for the remainder of the 2013/14 campaign.
