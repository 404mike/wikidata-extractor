Brighton drew the final, and then lost the replay, to Manchester United and were also relegated from the first division.

However, the following season saw Brighton slump to 11th place which, along with purported complaints from the players about Cattlin's management style, caused the board to axe him in favour of returning hero Alan Mullery.
