Mowbray played for Middlesbrough, Celtic and Ipswich Town as a defender.\nHe began his coaching career with Ipswich Town and took his first managerial job at Scottish Premier League side Hibernian, where he won the Scottish Football Writers' Association Manager of the Year award in his first season. He moved on to West Bromwich Albion in 2006, where he won the Football League Championship in 2008, but then suffered relegation from the Premier League the following year. Mowbray was then appointed as manager of Celtic, but was dismissed after nine months.\nMowbray subsequently took the manager's role at another of his former clubs, Middlesbrough. After a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season, Mowbray left Middlesbrough in October 2013. After a spell with Coventry City, he was appointed Blackburn Rovers manager in February 2017.

Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 1999\u20132000, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2001\u201302. After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003\u201304. In 2004\u201305, Megson's successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day \"Great Escape\", when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas, as well as bottom on the final day of the season. They failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006. The club competed in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007, but lost 1\u20130 to Derby County. The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1\u20130 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the 2008\u201309 campaign.

Tony Mowbray took charge of the club in June 2009, and he was succeeded a year later by Neil Lennon.

Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road with a view to Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term.
