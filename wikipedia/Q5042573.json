He played for local sides Cleveland Juniors and Marton Boys, before joining the youth system of hometown club Middlesbrough, who he supported as a boy, at the age of eight. He was offered at trial at Leeds United at 15, and after scoring five goals in two games he was offered a four-year contract at the club. He signed his first professional contract at the club in August 2002, after which he joined Third Division club Carlisle United on a one-month loan on 7 October. Following a successful loan spell at Carlisle, Farrell signed for the club permanently on a three-year contract in November for a fee that could have risen to \u00a350,000 depending on appearances. He was placed on Carlisle's transfer list in November 2003 as part of manager Paul Simpson's clear-out. He said he was prepared to wait patiently to earn a regular place in the first team, saying \"Karl and Magno have both been playing really well, so I can't really say much. I've only started one game this season in the LDV. I've got to keep working as hard as I can and make sure when my chance comes I take it.\" He was released by Carlisle in May 2005, along with teammates Kevin Henderson, Carlos Roca, Brian Shelley and Chris Beech."]}, {"page": "Carlos Roca", "response": ["Carlos Roca may refer to:", "*Carlos Roca (footballer) (born 1984), English footballer", "*Carlos Roca (field hockey) (1958\u20132003), Spanish field hockey player"]}]}}
