As President of the Commission, Delors pushed for stronger pan-European regulations in areas including industrial relations, health and safety, the environment and consumer protection. In addition he played a key role in the incorporation of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers into the Treaty of Maastricht, enshrining a series of workers' rights into European law. In the context of Thatcher's Conservative premiership, when policies to reduce the power of the trade unions were pursued, Delors' advocacy of a \"social Europe\" became attractive to many. In 1989 the Labour Party officially dropped support for a withdrawal from the EEC: by 1998 only three percent of the party's MPs supported leaving the EU."]}, {"page": "Todd (surname)", "response": ["* Ron Todd, British union leader", "* Ron Todd (footballer), Collingwood FC footballer."]}, {"page": "Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick", "response": ["*Ron Todd, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union"]}, {"page": "1927 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 March \u2013 Ron Todd, trade union leader (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (R)", "response": ["# Ron Todd (trade unionist)"]}, {"page": "March 1927", "response": ["*Born: Ron Todd, British trade union leader; President of TGWU 1985-92; in Walthamstow, London (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "List of Desert Island Discs episodes (1991\u20132000)", "response": ["|||Ron Todd||The collected works of Robert Burns|||| more"]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|rowspan=5| Ron Todd"]}, {"page": "Larry Smith (trade unionist)", "response": ["Smith planned to stand for the general secretaryship a third time in 1984, but ultimately endorsed Ron Todd, a fellow left-winger.\"TGWU man pulls out\", The Guardian, 2 February 1984  He was rewarded the following year with the post of Assistant General Secretary, which he held until his retirement in 1988."]}, {"page": "Ron Todd", "response": ["*Ron Todd (footballer) (1916\u20131991), Australian rules footballer for Collingwood and Williamstown", "*Ron Todd (trade unionist) (1927\u20132005), British trade union official"]}]}}
