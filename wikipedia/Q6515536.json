He once scored for the mighty Stags against local rivals, Chesterfield.\nOn 17 August 2014, Lee Wilson made history by becoming the first player to play for Mansfield Town and Mansfield Cricket Club.

His first goal for the club came after shooting into the bottom corner from a Lee Wilson back-heel in a 3\u20133 home draw with Salisbury City on 6 March 1999. He made 30 appearances and scored 1 goal in 1998\u201399, as his team finished 10th in the Southern League Premier Division. King's Lynn improved on their league performance in 1999\u20132000, finishing in fifth place in the table. Mills continued to appear frequently in the team, playing in 34 matches and scoring 1 goal. He resigned as King's Lynn manager on 8 November 2000 due to major financial problems at the club, and had made 16 appearances and scored one 1 up to that point in 2000\u201301. He returned to playing just three days later by signing for Football Conference club Boston United, making his debut the same day in a 2\u20132 home draw with Scarborough.", "Mills took over as manager of Second Division Notts County on 9 January 2004 after the resignation of Bill Dearden, with the club lying 23rd in the Second Division table. His first match in charge came just a day later, in which Marc Goodfellow scored a stoppage time winner for Bristol City as County were beaten 2\u20131 at home. After a run of good form from late February to early March 2004 County rose out of the relegation zone, but a run of one victory from the last 12 matches of 2003\u201304 saw the club relegated to League Two in 23rd place. Despite having a healthier playing budget and a reorganisation of the squad during the summer of 2004, County made a disappointing start to 2004\u201305. As a result, Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004 with the club 21st in League Two, and he declined the offer of a lesser position with the club. He resumed his playing career during early 2005 with Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Glapwell, playing under Lee Wilson, who Mills had previously played with and managed."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["**George Wilson (cricketer, born 1887) George Charles Lee Wilson (1887\u20131917), New Zealand cricketer", "**Joe Lee Wilson (1935\u20132011), American gospel-influenced jazz singer", "*Lee Wilson (footballer, born 1972), English football player and manager", "*Lee Wilson (footballer, born 1993), Scottish football goalkeeper for Cowdenbeath", "***Robert E.
