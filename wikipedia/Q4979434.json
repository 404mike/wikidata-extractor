Wizard is also a noted player of the harmonica.Originally active between 1978 and 1985, Wizard reformed The Homosexuals with new line-ups from 2003. He has been interviewed as a pundit for British television programmes. In 2013 a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his life, The Heart of Bruno Wizard, was screened at The East End Film Festival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Homosexuals", "response": ["The Rejects were formed in the bar of Goldsmith's College in South London in 1976, when ex-Sunderland art school students John Hazzard (real name: John Wilkins) and Glenn Hutchinson recruited Bruno Wizard (real name: Bruno McQuillan) to drum for their nascent band. He in turn introduced them to Howard H, a well known drummer, and as rehearsals got under way, Wizard took on the role of frontman and Hutchinson was sidelined. Wizard then recruited Ian Kane, who added more songs to Hazzard's original set of compositions, and to express his disquiet with the modern world and disappointment with his 1960s heroes. The Rejects played their first gig at punk club The Roxy in January 1977, without a bass player, supporting the Damned and the Vibrators. In the following five months, the Rejects played with Wire, Generation X, the Jam, Eater, 999 and Sham 69 on multiple occasions, with Wizard becoming increasingly confrontational (though no more tuneful) to their audiences. Performances routinely descended into violence, with dates at the Albany in Deptford and Barbarella's in Birmingham confirming the band as a bad risk for PA hire companies.", "The Heart Of Bruno Wizard (2013), directed by Elisabeth Rasmussen, was a feature-length documentary on the band's lead singer/songwriter and sole remaining original member."]}, {"page": "Fiasco (band)", "response": ["On August 29, 2008, they released their first music video, for the instrumental \"Oh, You Horny Monster!\" on Pitchfork.tv, to promote the upcoming release of Native Canadians.
