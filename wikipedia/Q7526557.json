The father, Sir Edward was created a baronet for services to politics and was at one time MP for Wakefield.  Frank Green's grandfather Edward Green had invented, and patented in 1845, a fuel economiser which was very successful during the 19th and 20th centuries and which made the family fortune.  Green was educated at Eton College and then the University of Oxford but he did not graduate.  Frank displayed a volatile temper from early on, once for example, striking a tutor with a cricket bat.  Whilst his brother's role was to raise the family's social position, Frank assisted his father in the management of the company that had factories in various countries."]}, {"page": "Rupert Lycett Green", "response": ["Lycett Green was born in England, the son of Commander David Cecil Lycett Green RN and Angela Courage (who later married Ralph Beckett, 3rd Baron Grimthorpe).
