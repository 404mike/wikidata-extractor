He made his club and Football League debut on 16 April 1932, coming in to play the last three matches at left back, normally occupied by Herbert Brown. He moved on to Third Division South club Northampton Town. He began the season in their London Combination team, and in early September, scored against Fulham's reserves \"with a shot which, if not from the half-way line, was taken from a point preciously close to it.\" He made his first-team debut on 24 December in a 2\u20132 draw with Norwich City, and played five more matches in the last few weeks of the season. Retained for 1933\u201334, he played nine games between September and November, but then injury kept him out until nearly the end of the season. He rejected Northampton's offer of terms for another season, and was transfer-listed at a fee of \u00a3200. There were no takers, and he dropped out of League football and signed for Kidderminster Harriers of the Birmingham & District League on a month's trial. The trial proved successful, but Allan turned down the terms offered, returned home and rejoined Darlington."]}, {"page": "Herbert Brown (Darlington footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Brown (footballer)"]}]}}
