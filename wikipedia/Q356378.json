Sinclair, along with four Chelsea players, had gone on a five-hour drinking binge and had stripped off, swore and vomited in front of American tourists just hours after the September 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people in America. He did though go on to re-establish himself in the starting eleven under new manager Dave Bassett. On 2 March 2002, Sinclair scored the most bizarre of his own goals. After 3 minutes into a game at Middlesbrough, he coolly slotted the ball past keeper Ian Walker in a seemingly laid-back situation in what proved to be the game's only goal. He held the Premier League records for most own goals, until his record was overtaken by Richard Dunne."]}, {"page": "Tim Flowers", "response": ["He was transferred to Leicester City, where he collected a Football League Cup winner's medal in his first season. In August 2002 he went on loan to Manchester City to provide cover for Carlo Nash after injuries to Peter Schmeichel and Nicky Weaver. He stayed with Leicester for one season after their relegation to Division One two years later before retiring as a player. His final appearance for Leicester City was against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in May 2003. It was the final game of the season, and with Leicester 1\u20130 down, Flowers came on as a late substitute for Ian Walker. Leicester were awarded a late penalty, and despite shouts from the travelling Leicester fans for Flowers to take the penalty, and Flowers himself signalling to the bench, Micky Adams (then Leicester manager) ignored the fans, and allowed Trevor Benjamin to take it, who scored."]}, {"page": "Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)", "response": ["Walker is the father of Ian Walker, former England goalkeeper.
