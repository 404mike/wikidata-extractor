She is chiefly remembered for her lengthy affair with the writer Vita Sackville-West, which the two women continued after their respective marriages. This was featured in novels by both parties; in Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando: A Biography, and in many letters and memoirs of the period, roughly 1912\u20131922. She may have been the inspiration for aspects of the character Lady Montdore in Nancy Mitford's Love in a Cold Climate, and of Muriel in Harold Acton's The Soul's Gymnasium.\nTrefusis herself wrote many novels, as well as non-fiction works, both in English and in French. Although some of her books sold well, others went unpublished, and her overall critical heritage remains lukewarm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cathryn Harrison", "response": ["* Portrait of a Marriage (1990, TV Mini-Series) - Violet Keppel Trefusis"]}]}}
