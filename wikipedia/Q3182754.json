He is considered \"the first bandmaster in Japan\" and \"the father of band music in Japan.\" Fenton is best known for having initiated the process through which Kimi ga yo came to be accepted as the national anthem of Japan.\nFenton is considered Irish because he was born in Kinsale, County Cork in Ireland in 1828. He may also be considered Scottish because his father John Fenton (1790\u20131833) was born in Brechin, and because he lived in Montrose around 1881. His mother, Judith Towers, was probably English. Journalistic writing on Fenton typically considers him a Briton.", "link_mentions": {}}}
