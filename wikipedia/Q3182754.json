He is considered \"the first bandmaster in Japan\" and \"the father of band music in Japan.\" Fenton is best known for having initiated the process through which Kimi ga yo came to be accepted as the national anthem of Japan.\nFenton is considered Irish because he was born in Kinsale, County Cork in Ireland in 1828. He may also be considered Scottish because his father John Fenton (1790\u20131833) was born in Brechin, and because he lived in Montrose around 1881. His mother, Judith Towers, was probably English. Journalistic writing on Fenton typically considers him a Briton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Meiji (era)", "response": ["With the contribution of foreign and Japanese authors, the first military music score collections were completed and published.

The lyrics of \"Kimigayo\" are probably the oldest among the world's national anthems, and with a length of 32 characters, they are also the world's shortest. The lyrics are from a  poem written by an unnamed author in the Heian period (794\u20131185), and the current melody was chosen in 1880, replacing an unpopular melody composed by John William Fenton eleven years earlier. Its length of 11 measures is currently among the world's shortest.

The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem, due to Fenton's influence. After selecting the anthem's lyrics, \u014cyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody and only a few days to rehearse, Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870. This was the first version of \"Kimigayo\". This was discarded because the melody \"lacked solemnity\", according to the Japanese government although others believe it is because the melody was actually \"unsingable\" for the Japanese. However, this version is still performed annually at the My\u014dk\u014dji temple in Yokohama, where Fenton served as a military band leader.
