Arbroath manager John Brownlie signed Browne as a replacement for Forrest, then discovered that Forrest had been duped. A telephone call that Forrest had believed to be from Danny Smith, the Raith chairman, had been a hoax. The caller had been Browne, Forrest's prospective replacement, although Browne argued it was \"a friend\". Forrest was reinstated at Arbroath and Browne summarily sacked, fleeing Scotland, although Forrest subsequently join Partick Thistle, which led Brownlie to re-sign Browne to fill the defensive gap. Brownlie had to check with captain Andy Dow that the players would accept Browne after the hoax."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Browne"]}, {"page": "Paul Browne", "response": ["Paul Browne may refer to:", "* Paul Browne (archer) (born 1961), British Paralympic archer", "* Paul Browne (footballer) (born 1975), retired Scottish football defender", "* Paul Browne (hurler) (born 1989), Irish hurler"]}]}}
