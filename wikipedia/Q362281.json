He made 420 appearances in the Premier League and Football League, including 135 for Reading.\nKitson began his career with non-League Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town before he joined Cambridge United in 2001 and became one of the brightest prospects in the Third Division which led to him being signed by Reading in 2003 for a fee of \u00a3150,000. He enjoyed great success with the \"Royals\", forming a formidable partnership with Kevin Doyle as Reading gained promotion to the Premier League in 2006. After two seasons in the top flight Reading were relegated and Kitson signed for newcomers Stoke City for a club record fee of \u00a35.5 million.\nHowever, his career soon started to become sour and, after failing to score a single goal, he was loaned back to Reading. He began the 2009\u201310 season better, scoring twice, but was then loaned out again this time to Middlesbrough. He returned to Stoke in January 2010 but continued to struggle and, after manager Tony Pulis branded him 'petulant', he was allowed to join Portsmouth as part of a swap deal for Marc Wilson. He spent two seasons at Fratton Park but agreed to cancel his contract with Portsmouth in August 2012 with the club in danger of being liquidated, and subsequently joined Sheffield United on a short-term deal, before signing a two-year contract at Oxford United in June 2013.\nSince retiring Daz and his family have moved to the North East of England, where he owns his own business selling soap.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Beattie (footballer)", "response": ["Beattie did not start 2009\u201310 very well: after a number of injuries hampered his pre-season training, he left the field of play against Chelsea on a stretcher after only 10 minutes, with fears of a suspected broken ankle. X-rays revealed ankle ligament damage. Beattie recovered, and won his place back in the team, surprisingly at the expense of a resurgent Dave Kitson, and had returned to scoring ways by October. However, a dressing-room altercation between Beattie and Pulis in December 2009 resulted in the striker falling out of favour."]}, {"page": "Tony Pulis", "response": ["Pulis guided Stoke City to promotion to the Premier League on the final matchday of the season, to be Stoke's first top flight campaign in 23 years.

Stoke's biggest summer signing was that of striker Dave Kitson, who joined from recently relegated Reading for \u00a35.5\u00a0million. Kitson was followed by the captures of Seyi Olofinjana from Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a33\u00a0million, Abdoulaye Faye from Newcastle United for \u00a32.25\u00a0million, Amdy Faye from Charlton Athletic for an undisclosed fee, Andrew Davies joined for \u00a31.2\u00a0million from Southampton, defender Ibrahima Sonko signed for an initial \u00a32\u00a0million fee from Reading and former Potter Danny Higginbotham rejoined his former club from Sunderland for an undisclosed fee.

Arca then set up the opening goal in the game for Leroy Lita, in a 1\u20131 draw against Nottingham Forest on 21 November 2009; which was followed up by setting a goal for Dave Kitson, who scored twice in the game, in a 2\u20132 draw against Peterborough United. He found himself in a competition with Adam Johnson, which saw Arca placed on the substitute bench and this last until Johnson's departure to Manchester City in January. However, Arca, himself, was plagued with injuries that saw him missed four matches at the beginning of 2010. It wasn't until on 16 February 2010 when he made his return to the first team from injury, coming on as a second\u2013half substitute, in a 2\u20130 loss against Blackpool. After missing one match, Arca made a return to the first team against Watford, where he set up an equalising goal for Lita, in a 1\u20131 draw.
