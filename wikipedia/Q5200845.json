Although Lynn comments that the word \"spin\" has \"probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,\" Iannucci suggests that the show \"taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras.\" The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the public relations training they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from autocue effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode \"The Ministerial Broadcast\", in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode \"A Conflict of Interest\" humorously lampoons the various political stances of Britain's newspapers through their readers (although this material was not original):There are various versions of the \"Times is read by the people who run the country\" patter, which has been attributed to an anonymous advertising copywriter: see, for example, J. M. & M.J. Cohen, The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations (revised ed. 1995), 3:31. It appears in Using the Media, by Denis MacShane, London 1979; MacShane attributes this to TUC President Cyril Plant in 1976"]}, {"page": "Leek, Staffordshire", "response": ["* Cyril Plant, Baron Plant CBE (1910 in Leek \u2013 1986) trade unionist, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation"]}, {"page": "Inland Revenue Staff Federation", "response": ["*1960: Cyril Plant"]}, {"page": "Cyril Thomas Howe Plant", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Plant"]}, {"page": "Cyril Plant, Baron Plant", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Plant"]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|rowspan=2| Cyril Plant"]}, {"page": "Baron Plant", "response": ["#REDIRECTCyril Plant"]}]}}
