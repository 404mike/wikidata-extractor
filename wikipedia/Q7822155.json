His Penguin Book of Welsh Verse (1967) has been especially helpful in bridging the gap between the Welsh and English speaking. In his own poetry he makes use of Welsh tradition: for example, his elegy for Welsh soldiers killed in the Falklands War is modelled on Aneirin's Y Gododdin.Pocket Guide. Swansea poet Harri Webb's (1920\u20131994) verse, including The Green Desert (1969), is marked in its themes by a radical and uncompromising commitment to Welsh nationalist politics. Another important poet of the late twentieth century is Tony Curtis (born 1946) from Carmarthen: he is the author of several collections, most recently War Voices (1995), The Arches (1998), and Heaven's Gate (2001). John Tripp (1927\u201386), a convinced Welsh nationalist, was ironically aware of the fact that, while born in Wales, he had worked outside the Principality until his early forties."]}, {"page": "1997 in literature", "response": ["*Cholmondeley Award: Alison Brackenbury, Gillian Clarke, Tony Curtis, Anne Stevenson"]}, {"page": "1974 in literature", "response": ["*Duncan Bush, Tony Curtis, Nigel Jenkins \u2013 Three Young Anglo-Welsh Poets"]}, {"page": "1972 in literature", "response": ["*Eric Gregory Award: Tony Curtis, Richard Berengarten, Brian Oxley, Andrew Greig, Robin Lee, Paul MuldoonSociety of Authors: Eric Gregory past winners .
