He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use.
