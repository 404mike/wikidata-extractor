For some time after the execution, it was claimed the father of the murdered child was Walter Wilkins the Younger, the son of the member of parliament and high sheriff of the county and the \"young squire\" of Maesllwch Castle. By the early 1820s, the old building was in a dilapidated condition and the justices decided to commission a new structure: the site they selected was occupied by the county prison."]}]}}
