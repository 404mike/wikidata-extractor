He's distributing the CD in Borders bookstores across the country and that kind of marketing savvy is a hint as to how the follically-challenged fret melter uses his noodle. Like a lot of instrumental records Bald On The Inside showcases a vast array of playing techniques, ranging from Jeff Beck's vocal tremolo arm mastery and Joe Satriani's up-tempo boogie style through to Tommy Bolin phrasing and Steve Vai-style melodic rock. This is impressive, world-class stuff and if you like great guitar playing you should definitely check it out.\"", "Cliff Douse of Guitar Techniques magazine gave this album a favourable review stating:  \"An graduate from the Guitar Institute in London, Tim Scott has since worked as a session musician and played in numerous bands. His debut album, Bald On The Inside, is an intriguing selection of instrumental rock numbers. There are some discernable elements of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani in Tim's playing but he has incorporated them into a style of his own.

Instead, Scott took his guitar where, hitherto, the guitar had not exactly been welcome\u2026 clubland! He began attaching his bewilderingly fine guitar-noodling to the kind of rhythms you would expect to hear in a Balearic club rather than a rock venue. It was a cunning move. Although you will hear some familiar cheesy Ibiza synth sounds here and some floor-quaking beats, you will also hear something more musically eloquent than usual dance fare. It is good to hear this kind of fast and furious guitar playing set against this kind of rhythm too; the one complaint I've had about the likes of Satriani in the past is that, rhythmically, they are sometimes not very adventurous. The Spanish flavour here lends itself to a kind of turbo-charged flamenco, which Scott does very well indeed. Perhaps we could do with a little more at a lower tempo, like the slightly less frenetic One Life which demonstrates a lovely touch from Scott, worthy of Satch himself. But you wonder whether this album may fall between two stools: too clubby for the guitar nuts, too axe-heavy for the clubbers. That would be a shame, as Scott is a genuine innovator.\"", "Guitarist (magazine) gave this album a favourable review stating:  \"Don't let the title put you off - no, really. Instead of mind-numbing club music requiring disco pharmaceuticals just to get through (Volume XIV), Tim Scott gives us an album of expressive, shred-vibed guitar set to dance beats. At times it sounds like Pendulum with extra whammy and harmoniser. There's even, dare we say it, a touch of Brian May in his cascading melodic runs, while super-swift tapping joins standard funky, tropical beats on tracks such as Rio Gold Dust.\"", "Guitar Techniques (magazine) gave this album a positive review stating: \"One of the biggest problems that every guitar-playing virtuoso faces is how to make all that instrumental expertise and technique appeal to more than a handful of dedicated followers. Well perhaps this Guitar Mashing, download only, release from the highly talented Tim Scott can provide at least one solution. Here seven highly intricate instrumental tracks have been given a solid dance back beat and a remix that makes them fun to listen to, and even if you're not about to spend the night in a sleazy club in Ibiza this is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. What's more it's still technically breath-taking so none of the expertise is lost, it's just made accessible to a much wider audience. On the downside, nothing really stands out but when it's all such a high standard there's nowhere left to go. But well done Tim, it's about time someone turned this into an art form.\"", "* Tim Scott \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, synth, percussion, drums, and drum programming", "* Tim Scott \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing", "* Tim Scott"]}, {"page": "Tim Scott (disambiguation)", "response": ["Tim Scott (born 1965) is a United States Senator from the state of South Carolina.", "* Tim Scott (American football) (born 1993), American football safety", "* Tim Scott (baseball) (born 1966), American pitcher", "* Tim Scott (footballer) (born 1971), former Australian rules footballer", "* Tim Scott (hurler) (1895\u20131972), Irish hurler", "* Tim Scott (guitarist) (born 1971), British instrumental recording artist", "* Tim Scott (artist) (born 1937), British sculptor", "* Tim Scott McConnell (born 1958), American singer-songwriter, also known as Ledfoot"]}, {"page": "Angel Dust (Tim Scott single)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tim Scott (guitarist) "]}]}}
