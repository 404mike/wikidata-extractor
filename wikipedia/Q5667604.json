The following day the club announced that Saudi Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad Al Saud, of the royal House of Saud and former President of Al-Hilal FC, had bought a 50% stake in United's parent company 'Blades Leisure Ltd' for the fee of \u00a31 with the promise of providing \"substantial new capital\" with the aim of returning the Blades to the Premier League as \"quickly as possible\". The same evening, United reached the second round of the Football League Trophy, despite failing to score for the third game in succession, winning a penalty shoot out over Scunthorpe United after the game had finished 0\u20130. Back in league action United were again the losing side as they were beaten 3\u20131 by near neighbours Rotherham United. Later that week, youngster Elliott Whitehouse was allowed to join York City on a month's loan to gain first team experience, before United's poor form continued as they slipped to a 1\u20130 defeat away at Carlisle United. With the side still struggling to score goals, United reached an agreement to bring in free agent Marlon King until the end of the season, quickly followed by winger Ryan Hall, who joined the Blades on a one-month loan from Leeds United. King and Hall both made their United debuts in the following game, a home fixture against Preston North End, but the Blades poor form continued as they fell to a 1\u20130 loss, their fifth consecutive defeat in the league and Preston's first victory at Bramall Lane since 1978. United ended the month with another defeat, this time a 2\u20130 away loss to Wolves.", "October began with the arrival of defender Simon Lappin who signed on a 28-day loan from Cardiff City on 4 October, while Chris Porter was allowed to leave in a similar deal for a spell with Chesterfield, and young striker Harry Bunn extended his own loan spell with the Blades for a further month. Lappin made his debut that same night as United scored their first goal in nearly seven hours of football, when Marlon King netted to earn a 1\u20131 home draw with Crawley Town. Another loss followed, this time to League Two Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy, a match during which David Weir was barracked by the home support. This was to prove Weir's last game in charge as he was sacked three days later. With the club's Under-21s coach Chris Morgan in temporary charge once more, United dropped to the bottom of the League One table as they were defeated 3\u20132 by Coventry City. With United still to appoint a permanent successor to David Weir, Mick Wadsworth was appointed as first team coach on a temporary basis to support Chris Morgan, and the pair guided United to only their second win of the season as they beat Port Vale 2\u20131 at Bramall Lane. Ryan Hall returned to Leeds United, only to be immediately suspended by his parent club for a breach of discipline, while Morgan and Wadsworth remained in charge as United held Peterborough United to a mid-week 0\u20130 draw at their London Road Stadium. This was to prove Morgan's last game in charge of the Blades as former Derby County manager Nigel Clough was appointed as David Weir's permanent successor on 23 October 2013. Clough's tenure got off to a winning start as his new charges comfortably beat Crewe Alexandra 3\u20131 at Bramall Lane, before Clough made his first signing for the Blades a few days later, with Leeds United defender Aidan White joining on loan until New Year's Day.", "Clough's second game in charge proved less satisfactory, with Febian Brandy being sent off only twelve minutes after coming on as a substitute and United slumping to a 2\u20130 defeat at Shrewsbury Town on 2 November. With his loan spell due to expire, United agreed a further deal to keep Simon Lappin at the club until January. The first round of the FA Cup saw the Blades progressed after a 3\u20132 victory over Colchester United, before Joe Ironside was allowed to join Halifax Town on loan until 5 January. Back in league action United suffered another home defeat, this time at the hands of Gillingham who ran out 2\u20131 winners. Callum McFadzean was allowed to join Chesterfield on loan until 3 January, before United registered their first away win since March, defeating fellow strugglers Bristol City 1\u20130 thanks to an own goal. United's followed this up with a 1\u20131 draw in a midweek home fixture against Walsall. With the loan window about to close Darryl Westlake was loaned to Mansfield Town, Marcus Williams joined Scunthorpe United, and Harry Bunn returned to Manchester City.
