For the first time, the Conservatives employed pre-conference advertising to publicise the new-style conference. Tebbit persuaded Thatcher that ministers would state their objectives that they would achieve in the next three years; Saatchi & Saatchi would use these to design posters, leaflets, and brochures to be deployed as each minister finished their speech. The aim \"was that in 1986 the media should reflect the image I wanted\u2014of a Government confident, united, clear in where it was going\u2014and determined to get there\".Tebbit, p. 319. According to Tebbit the conference \"was more successful than I had dared to hope ... the opinion polls which had us 7% behind in June and still 5% down in September now put us back into first place\u2014a position we never relinquished from then right through the election campaign. The Prime Minister's ratings were immediately restored\".Tebbit, p. 320."]}, {"page": "Denis Thatcher", "response": ["His wife's biographer Robin Harris concludes:"]}, {"page": "Robin Harris", "response": ["Robin Harris was born in Chicago, Illinois.

She hired a previous director of the Conservative Research Department, Robin Harris, to do most of the writing, the Oxford academic Christopher Collins to do the research and O'Sullivan to help polish the drafts. Just like with her speeches, Thatcher would \"edit, criticise and exhaustively rewrite the drafts\" until she was happy."]}, {"page": "Bruges speech", "response": ["The speech was perceived as an attack upon the \"European project\".  However, Thatcher supported the Common Market and had intended the speech to be anti-federalist, not anti-Europe.  Delors admitted that \"technically it was a good speech, well written, beautiful phrases.  She was very direct, very comprehensible\" but considered it to be an attack on the EEC. Lord Thomas of Swynnerton was at heart a Europhile and was disappointed that the speech was perceived as being anti-Europe.  The speech was seen as a warning against expanding the remit of the EEC beyond the limits of the Treaty of Rome into the social policy of member states.  Though it did not mention socialism by name, the speech was seen as implying that the EEC was turning into a socialist state.  The author Robin Harris considered the speech the most important of Thatcher's prime-ministerial career.  He regarded it as marking British resistance to the Economic and Monetary Union and setting out an alternative model for European cooperation under a voluntary association of independent states."]}]}}
