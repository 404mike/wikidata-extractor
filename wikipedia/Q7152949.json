The band signed with Logo Records in 1978 and whilst negotiating a deal for an album, Phillips wrote \"Car 67\". At the time, Phillips was a taxi driver, which he has described himself as being \"so bad as a cabbie, I never earned enough to pay the rent on the radio\". He wrote the song within minutes and recorded a demo of it. He showed the demo to Zorn who said that it was missing a middle eight, and then helped come up with it. Phillips then showed the song to Logo with the idea of releasing it as a side project. The record company were very eager to have the song, so in September, Phillips negotiated a three-month deal for the one single, \"Car 67\", meaning that Logo could have the option to tie down the band for an album, so long as they did so within the three months.", "* Paul Phillips \u2013 vocals (the taxi driver)"]}, {"page": "Paul Phillips (songwriter/singer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Phillips (singer)"]}]}}
