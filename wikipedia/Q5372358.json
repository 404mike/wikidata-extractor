Although code for simple conversational programs like ELIZA have existed since the 1960s, and limited dialog options have existed in interactive fiction since the 1970s, Short's efforts to develop chatterbot-like dialog required her to produce a simple test case scenario to test NPC interaction.

The game's multiple endings also arose in a similar fashion although Short had intended that there be multiple endings from the start. Although the nature of the game's development as well as its minimalist final form has led to questions regarding whether it is really a game and not just an experimental conversational program, Short has suggested that to her the definition of interactive fiction requires nothing more than a world model and a parser, and \"anything you can cook up with those features counts as IF.\"Vestal, Andrew and Nich Maragos.

However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to \"histrionic, bipolar deportment\". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of Portals resonance comes from the fact that using the portal gun to escape the center is a \"cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic\". Grant Tavinor, author of The Art of Videogames, wrote that GLaDOS's actions and personality in Portal were \"in the best of science fiction traditions\" and describes her as \"insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane\".
