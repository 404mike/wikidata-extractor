The jury had to decide at what point the behaviour of those on trial could be considered a criminal rather than a serious disciplinary matter; even the lawyers found this difficult to define. Cox subsequently publicly criticised the vagueness of the law, and its disproportionate use that had led to the prosecution."]}, {"page": "Sportsound", "response": ["*Geoff Webster (host of live rugby and Sunday show)"]}, {"page": "Webster (surname)", "response": ["*Geoff Webster (born 1959), British journalist, and deputy editor of The Sun"]}, {"page": "Operation Elveden", "response": ["As of 10 January 2012 nine arrests had been made. These include a journalist working for News International, arrested and taken to a south west London police station on 4 November 2011. He was later identified by the media as Jamie Pyatt of The Sun. Later that same month, the BBC reported that five more arrests had been made, four journalists and a policeman, bringing the total number of arrests to 14. The following month, the BBC reported that eight people, including five Sun employees, had been arrested by police regarding allegations of corrupt payments to police and public officials. The Guardian and Daily Telegraph reported that they included The Suns deputy editor Geoff Webster, and its chief foreign correspondent and picture editor.", "On 20 March 2015, four Sun journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories after a trial at the Old Bailey. Ex-chief reporter John Kay and ex-royal editor Duncan Larcombe successfully argued that their contact with two military sources had been in the public interest, whilst former deputy editors Fergus Shanahan and Geoff Webster were cleared of charges that they had signed off illegal payments. The trial heard that \u00a3100,000 was paid to Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan-Barber, who had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office and was jailed in January 2015. Reporting restrictions had suppressed this information until the conclusion of the Sun journalists' trial. A fifth defendant, former colour sergeant John Hardy, was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office. He had allegedly been paid nearly \u00a324,000 for providing Larcombe with information on 34 occasions; the court heard that these had included stories relating to Prince William and Prince Harry. Hardy's wife Claire, who had been accused of collecting illegal payments for her husband, was cleared of aiding and abetting him."]}, {"page": "Alison Webster (photographer)", "response": ["Webster is married to the deputy editor of The Sun, Geoff Webster, who was cleared in March 2015, along with colleagues, of making illegal payments to public officials after a trial at the Old Bailey.
