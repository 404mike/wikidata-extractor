The seafront remained the main attraction, so an array of features were added: pleasure piers, promenades, hotels, entertainment kiosks and an aquarium. The West Pier and Palace Pier date from 1863 and 1891 respectively, although both were completed several years later; Madeira Drive was laid out in 1872 and received its \"signature cast-iron terrace\" (including a pagoda-shaped lift decorated with Greek gods) in the 1890s; Kings Road was widened in the 1880s; and large hotels began to line it even before this. Early-19th-century hotels such as the Royal Albion, Royal York and Bedford were joined by an Italianate pair by John Whichcord Jr. (the Grand, 1864) and Horatio Nelson Goulty (the Norfolk, 1865). Then in 1890 the vast Metropole Hotel by Alfred Waterhouse \"broke the orthodoxy of stucco along the seafront\" due to its prominent red-brick and terracotta fa\u00e7ade. Its deliberately different design caused shock and brought criticism, but the British Architect journal considered it \"a wonderful relief\" from the homogeneity of stuccoed Regency buildings. Brighton's architecture was beginning to reflect trends in the country as a whole, but the Regency style and the Royal Pavilion's onion-domed, minaret-studded opulence continued to influence architecture throughout the town, and on the seafront in particular.", "Hove, meanwhile, was also developing rapidly \u2014 but its influences were different. Although the Brunswick estate was successful, development of the neighbouring Adelaide Crescent stalled for more than 20 years and Decimus Burton's original design was scaled back. Next came Palmeira Square ( 1855\u20131865), where the evolution from Regency to Victorian Italianate is clear, and there was some suburban development (called Cliftonville) around the new Hove railway station in the 1860s, but large tracts of land to the north and west remained undeveloped because of conditions in William Stanford's will. Only in 1872 did these conditions expire, and over the next 30 years Hove developed into a comfortable, spacious, suburban town with \"a certain gentility\" which it still possesses. Architects James Knowles and Henry Jones Lanchester were involved at first, and William Willett built the streets of ornately decorated gault brick villas they designed. Next came H. B. Measures and Amos Faulkner, who introduced more architectural variety and preferred red brick; then local architects Thomas Lainson and Clayton & Black laid out further estates of spacious tree-lined avenues and large half-timbered houses in the Queen Anne Revival and Domestic Revival styles. Public buildings were also provided, such as Hove Town Hall (1882; demolished 1966), a public library (1907\u201308) and Hove Museum and Art Gallery (a converted villa of 1877 designed in \"drab Italianate\" style by Thomas Lainson). Good Gothic Revival churches of this era include Central United Reformed Church (1867 by Horatio Nelson Goulty), the \"dignified and grand\" Sacred Heart (1880\u201381 by John Crawley) and Holy Trinity (1863 by James Woodman). Specialist building development company Medical Centre Developments bought the disused Holy Trinity in February 2016 for conversion into a medical centre."]}, {"page": "Cemeteries and crematoria in Brighton and Hove", "response": ["Immediately after Cresy published his report, though, a group of public figures in Brighton took action themselves.  They included doctor and politician John Cordy Burrows, the Union Chapel's minister Rev. John Nelson Goulty, his son the architect Horatio Nelson Goulty, and fellow architect Amon Henry Wilds.  In 1850, they formed the Brighton Extra Mural Company for the purposes of acquiring land and establishing a private cemetery for Anglican, Roman Catholic and Nonconformist burials.  They bought  east of the Lewes Road and near Race Hill.  Apart from a small section for non-Anglican burials, the land was consecrated by Ashurst Turner Gilbert, the Bishop of Chichester, on 14 August 1851, and burials took place from November that year.  The land formed part of Scabe's Castle Farm, established in the 18th century."]}, {"page": "Hounsom Memorial United Reformed Church, Hove", "response": ["Hove was a village and parish that developed rapidly as a residential area in the 19th century in response to the growth of neighbouring Brighton. The Union Chapel, founded in the 17th century in Brighton, extended its mission to Hove in 1823, when some members established a Sunday school and temporary place of worship in a building belonging to local resident John Vallance.  The congregation grew, and land was bought in 1861 for a permanent church in the rapidly developing Cliftonville area of Hove. Cliftonville Congregational Church was designed by Horatio Nelson Goulty and opened in 1870 as the first Nonconformist church in the town."]}, {"page": "Norfolk Hotel, Brighton", "response": ["The Norfolk Hotel (currently branded as the Mercure Brighton Seafront Hotel, and previously as the Ramada Jarvis Hotel Brighton and other names) is a 4-star hotel in the seaside resort of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove.  Designed in 1865 by architect Horatio Nelson Goulty, it replaced an earlier building called the Norfolk Inn and is one of several large Victorian hotels along the seafront.  The French Renaissance Revival-style building, recalling E.M. Barry's major London hotels, is \"tall, to make a show\": the development of the passenger lift a few years earlier allowed larger hotels to be built. It is a Grade II listed building.", "The 1860s was a time of innovation in hotel building and architecture. By the mid-19th century, staying in hotels had become much more popular than renting a large house for several months, which had been the norm for Brighton's wealthy visitors over the previous century.  The Royal Albion and (original) Bedford Hotels of the 1820s were smaller-scale early examples, but only with the development of the passenger lift could they be built on a grand scale. One of Britain's first lifts\u2014a water-powered \"ascending omnibus\", as it was called\u2014was fitted in the newly built Grand Hotel on Kings Road in 1864. The following year, the Norfolk Arms was completely rebuilt, retaining nothing of its original form.  Architect Horatio Nelson Goulty was commissioned for the job; an important figure in public life in Brighton, he was one of the founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in 1850 and later in the 1860s designed Congregational churches in Newhaven and Hove. Goulty designed the building (now solely a hotel rather than an inn, and renamed the Norfolk Hotel accordingly) in a similar style to the Grand, albeit \"slightly more florid\". The author of Moorecroft's Guide (1866), a guidebook about the resort, called the rebuilt hotel \"more beautiful than any other building in Brighton\" despite offering mild criticism of the Grand's very similar architecture. As originally built, the Norfolk was much smaller than the Grand, with 64 bedrooms arranged over five floors compared to the latter's 150 bedrooms and eight storeys. Nevertheless, it was one of the major hotels of Victorian-era Brighton, which is \"one of the few places in Britain where ... grand hotels of the European model can be seen\". Along with the Grand and the nearby Metropole (1890), it was one of the \"great show hotels on the front\", at which only wealthy visitors would have stayed; the thousands of working-class holidaymakers would have used the poorer lodging-houses in less favourable locations.", "Horatio Nelson Goulty designed the Norfolk Hotel in the French Renaissance Revival style, \"perhaps to compete with the Grand\" which, although larger, is similar in appearance. Closest in style to the Norfolk, though, were two contemporary hotels at major London railway stations that were designed by E.M. Barry: the Cannon Street Hotel (1861) and the Charing Cross Hotel (1864). The new building was taller than its predecessor, with five storeys and three large mansard roofs decorated with wrought ironwork. The south-facing fa\u00e7ade is stuccoed, and its windows are set in segmental-arched architraves with prominent keystones."]}, {"page": "John Nelson Goulty", "response": ["Goulty also one of the four founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in Brighton.  In 1850, in response to a Government health inspector's critical report about sanitary conditions and public health in Brighton\u2014which recommended that burials in churchyards and chapel burial grounds should cease\u2014the doctor and political John Cordy Burrows, architect Amon Henry Wilds, Goulty and his son Horatio Nelson Goulty established the Brighton Extra Mural Company, acquired  of land near Race Hill, and laid out a private cemetery for Anglican, Roman Catholic and Nonconformist burials.", "Goulty's pastorate at Union Chapel ended in 1861 with his retirement, although in 1868 he founded a Congregational chapel at Sudeley Place in the Kemptown area of Brighton.  (This closed in 1918 and was converted into a cinema by John Leopold Denman and later into a residential building.)  He died in Brighton on 18 January 1870 and was buried at the Extra Mural Cemetery.  His grave is in the unconsecrated southwest section of the cemetery and is marked by an obelisk-style memorial. His son Horatio Nelson Goulty, who predeceased him, was also active in public life in Brighton, principally as an architect but also as a supporter of hospitals and schools.", "*Horatio Nelson Goulty (1830\u20131869; prominent architect in Brighton), christened 27 July 1830"]}, {"page": "Bear Road, Brighton", "response": ["South of Bear Road, about  of the land formerly belonging to Scabe's Castle Farm is now covered by cemeteries.  The Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery is the earliest: it was founded in 1850 by the Brighton Extra Mural Company, which was set up by four eminent Brightonians who were concerned about the lack of burial space in the growing town and the implications for public health.  Nonconformist minister John Nelson Goulty, his son the architect Horatio Nelson Goulty, fellow architect Amon Henry Wilds and doctor and politician John Cordy Burrows bought an initial  of land and laid out a private cemetery for Anglican, Roman Catholic and Nonconformist burials.  The cemetery now covers  and is maintained by Brighton and Hove City Council.  In 1857, the Brighton Parochial Cemetery was founded on  of land adjoining the Extra Mural Cemetery; it is now called the Woodvale Cemetery and also has Sussex's first crematorium\u2014the Woodvale Crematorium\u2014which opened in 1930.  A third cemetery opened north of Bear Road and opposite the Extra Mural Cemetery in 1868: it covers  and is known as City Cemetery or Bear Road Cemetery.  In 1886, a fourth cemetery\u2014again privately operated, a status which it still retains\u2014opened on  of land southeast of the Woodvale Cemetery.  It is called the Brighton and Preston Cemetery and also has a crematorium.  In 1919, the new Meadowview Jewish Cemetery (replacing a 19th-century facility on Ditchling Road in Round Hill) was laid out on land between the Bear Road Cemetery and the Meadowview estate.  The  site was extended in 1978 when  was added to the northeast."]}]}}
