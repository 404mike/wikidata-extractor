They needed to carve a passage through Ismailia and the cultivated Delta. Both attacks were repulsed. The Household Cavalry under the command of General Drury Drury-Lowe led the \"Moonlight Charge\", consisting of the Royal Horse Guards and 7th Dragoon Guards galloping at full tilt into enemy rifle fire. Their ranks were whittled down from the saddle, but still they charged headlong, ever forward. Sir Baker Russell commanded 7th on the right; whereas the Household was led by Colonel Ewart, c/o of the Life Guards. They captured 11 Egyptian guns.  Despite only half a dozen casualties, Wolseley was so concerned about the quality of his men that he wrote Cambridge for reforms to recruiting. Nonetheless these were the elite of the British army and, these skirmishes were costly. Legend and a poem \"At Kassassin\", say the battle began as it was getting dark."]}, {"page": "Sir Drury Curzon Drury-Lowe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Drury Drury-Lowe"]}, {"page": "Drury Curzon Drury-Lowe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Drury Drury-Lowe"]}]}}
