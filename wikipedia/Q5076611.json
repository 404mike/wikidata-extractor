While boarding the train from Victoria Station to Edinburgh he was accompanied with Lord Athlone and Sir Charles Cust. In the train Major Gordon received the message that the King wanted that he guided him personally to the city. While visiting Edinburgh Castle, a Scottish officer who was conducting a drill, recognised King Albert and called the battalion in formation. King Albert was very pleased and learned that the officer had been returned not long ago from the trenches at Ypres and therefore recognised the King. Afterwards King Albert said to Major Gordon: \" Major, you are to blame for this. Your brassard has given me away!\". King Albert and Queen Elisabeth visited afterwards the Grand Fleet and the Queen asked if she could send a picture of her to her namesake ship, the H.M.S. Queen Elisabeth. The picture was later permanent placed on deck barring the inscription: H.M. Queen Elisabeth to H.M.S. \"Queen Elizabeth\" 9.7.1917."]}, {"page": "Cust, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Cust"]}]}}
