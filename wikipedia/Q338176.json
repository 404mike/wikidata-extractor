In 1961 the Ripon Canal Company Ltd was formed, consisting largely of people who were part of the Ripon Motor Boat Club, with the intention of leasing the canal and gradually reopening it. The lower half from Oxclose Lock to Littlethorpe was finally restored to use 25 years later. To assist with the restoration of the section from Littlethorpe Lock to Ripon the Inland Waterways Association managed to have the idea included in North Yorkshire County Council's \"River Ure and Ouse Recreational Subject Plan\". The Council suggested that a restoration society should push this forwards and so the Ripon Canal Society was formed in 1983. The restoration was finally completed in 1996 and David Curry MP declared it open at a ceremony held on 8 September. With their task completed the Ripon Canal Society disbanded at their 1997 annual general meeting, giving the remains of their funds towards the repair of Linton Lock lower down the River Ure. Management of the canal was handed over to British Waterways and transferred to the Canal & River Trust in 2012."]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in British public life", "response": ["| David Curry"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*David Curry"]}, {"page": "Cleveland (county)", "response": ["This split was contested by Cleveland County Council, who applied for judicial review over the decision.
