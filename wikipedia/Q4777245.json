He has collaborated with a number of high-profile musicians, including David Bowie, Robert Palmer, Iva Davies, Steve Strange, and Duran Duran, but especially Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music, whose look was defined by Price's designs. The manner in which Price dressed \u2013 or in many cases, undressed \u2013 the \"Roxy girls\" on the covers of their albums helped to define the band's pop retro-futurism.\nMore recently, Price has been noted for dressing celebrities such as Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Patsy Kensit, Anjelica Huston, Jerry Hall, Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana Ross, Melanie Griffith, Yasmin Le Bon and burlesque performer Dita Von Teese.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roxy Music", "response": ["They were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer Antony Price, hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's \"PR consultant\" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay's) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas De Ville. Well-known critic Lester Bangs went so far as to say that Roxy represented \"the triumph of artifice\". Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including Marilyn Monroe, Motown and Stax Records artists. He also stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time which would feature artists \"in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.\""]}, {"page": "Duran Duran", "response": ["From the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam Ant during 1980\u201381. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with Vivienne Westwood and in the 2000s with Giorgio Armani. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer Malcolm Garrett and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials."]}, {"page": "Brintons", "response": ["In 1993, Brintons launched an advertising campaign featuring costumes made from the company's carpets designed by Vivienne Westwood.

After showing up at Lucie Daouphars' Parisian model school (known as Lucky), she was sent by G\u00e9rald Nanty to Karl Lagerfeld's then model maker at Jean Patou's. Amanda Lear was a runway model for Lagerfeld and meets Catherine Harl\u00e9, the head of a modelling agency, who offered her a contract. With her modelling assignment, she walked for rising star Paco Rabanne in 1967. Just as Harl\u00e9 had predicted, her looks were very much in demand. Soon after her debut Lear was photographed by Helmut Newton, Charles Paul Wilp and Antoine Giacomoni for magazines such as Beau (1966), mr. (1966), Le Nouveau Candide,  (1967), Scandal, , Nova, The Daily Telegraph, Stern, Bravo and Vogue. She modelled for fashion designers including Yves Saint Laurent and Coco Chanel in Paris and Mary Quant, Ossie Clark and Antony Price in London. After some time, Lear dropped out of art school to model full-time and went on to lead a bohemian and flamboyant life in the Swinging London of the 1960s. Lear's acquaintances included The Beatles and fellow top models Twiggy, Pattie Boyd and Anita Pallenberg. In late 1966, she began dating Brian Jones whom she first met prior through Tara Browne. Their relationship inspired Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for the track \"Miss Amanda Jones\" from Between the Buttons, alluding the romance between Jones and Lear as she's described as \"Ms. Jones\".Il para\u00eetrait que cette Miss Amanda Jones n'est autre qu'Amanda Lear qui en effet tra\u00eenait avec Brian., Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric , \u00ab Rolling Stones 63/90 Le Chemin des pierres \u00bb, Musicien, Hors-s\u00e9rie, , \u00ab Sp\u00e9cial Rolling Stones \u00bb, 1990, . She became a \"stalwart of London's demimonde\", an exotic name on the nightclub circuit and a regular fixture in the gossip columns. The model was arrested in 1967 by the police with drugs belonging to The Rolling Stones. Lear appeared in several advertisements for major brands, modelling among others for a Chantelle underwear range and the Detchema fragrance by a French company R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res in 1967, and in 1968 played a minor role in a French comedy film Ne jouez pas avec les Martiens and made an appearance in the 1968 British psychedelic film Wonderwall."]}, {"page": "Siren (Roxy Music album)", "response": ["The cover features band member Bryan Ferry's then-girlfriend, model Jerry Hall, on rocks near South Stack, Anglesey.
