By 1979 he had developed a custom-built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. They were designed around 2\u00a0inch x 650b Nokian snow tires though a 700x47c (28 in.) version was also produced. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until late 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until the early 1990s."]}, {"page": "29er (bicycle)", "response": ["In the early 1980s, the size of the wheels for the emerging mountain bikes was undecided. So when English off-road cycling pioneer Geoff Apps contacted Gary Fisher  and Charlie Kelly with news that he had built a prototype off-road bicycle that used large-diameter 28 x 1\u00be (ISO 47-622), 47mm wide Nokian Hakkapeliitta snow tires from Finland, they were intrigued. In a letter to the December 2006 issue of Bike Biz magazine, Gary Fisher, speaking about the growing popularity of 29ers, gives his perspective: \"We got some tires from Geoff Apps really early on and we [Fisher and Kelly] said 'Holy Toledo!'\" But the poor supply situation of the larger diameter tires meant the fledgling MTB industry stuck with the smaller wheel size.\"  The first Geoff Apps-designed 700C wheeled off-road bicycle was made in 1981.Gary Fisher on the history of mountain bike wheel size https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8syt59gK65o"]}, {"page": "Apps (surname)", "response": ["*Geoff Apps (born 1949), English mountain bike pioneer"]}]}}
