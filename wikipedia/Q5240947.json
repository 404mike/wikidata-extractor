According to Ludendorff, the two were intertwined. This program was originally called 'Enlightenment service' (Aujklarungsdienst) but was changed to 'Patriotic Instruction' (Vaterliindischer Unterricht) in September 1917. According to historian David Welch, Ludendorff's program stressed four ideas:Feldman, Gerald (1966).

Others reject the idea that Western media was involved in anti-Serb propaganda. The historian Marko Attila Hoare disputed the claims, which he saw as coming from \"left revisionists\", and emphasized that \"demonization of Serbs\" actually represented a diversity of opinions on the war and that those on the \"Western far left\" making such arguments were among other things \"cynical and hypocritical in [their] use of both facts and arguments\". Publishers Weekly's review of Parenti's book stated, \"While other Balkan political and military leaders may also deserve blame, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 does not deserve a defense.\"", "Historians specializing in propaganda, Nicholas Cull, David Holbrook Culbert and David Welch, described the Kosovo War as the \"extreme case of the use propaganda by all sides in late 20th century\", and also as the first war in which the internet played a significant role in the propaganda campaign. They explained countries in NATO viewing the public support for their actions as \"critical areas of vulnerability\". The strategy included daily special government press conferences and updates of websites."]}, {"page": "Jud S\u00fc\u00df", "response": ["Daniel Azuelos ascribes the cast's reluctance to an unwillingness to be typecast as Jews. David Welch identifies Werner Krauss as having asked Goebbels to make a public pronouncement stating that Krauss was not Jewish but merely \"playing a part as an actor in the service of the State.\" In order to address their concerns, Goebbels issued a disclaimer stating that those actors playing the parts of Jews were in fact of pure 'Aryan' blood.", "The character of S\u00fc\u00df is based on the stereotype of the grasping Jewish moneylender. There is an early scene in which S\u00fc\u00df is shown to possess a fortune in jewels and jewelry. In another, he tells an innocent German girl that his home is \"the world\" (reflecting the Nazi stereotype of Jews as rootless wanderers in contrast to the Germans' love of their German homeland). Several conversations between Jewish characters perpetuate the Nazi line that Jews are inherently hostile to non-Jews. According to David Welch, the Nazis issued a guide to the press explaining how to interpret the film. The guide emphasized that a key point of the film was that once Jews like S\u00fc\u00df got into positions of responsibility and power, \"they exploited power, not for the good of the community, but for their own racial ends.\""]}, {"page": "David Welch", "response": ["David Welch may refer to:", "*David Welch (diplomat) (born 1953), American diplomat", "*David Welch (baseball) (born 1983), baseball pitcher", "*David Welch (optical engineer) (born 1960), American businessman and research scientist", "*David Welch (historian), English historian", "*David Welch (New Hampshire politician) (born 1940), member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives"]}, {"page": "Cinema and the Swastika", "response": ["Cinema and the Swastika: The International Expansion of Third Reich Cinema is a 2007 book published by Palgrave Macmillan and edited by Roel Vande Winkel and David Welch."]}]}}
