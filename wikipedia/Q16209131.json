He represented Great Britain at two consecutive Summer Olympics starting in 2000. At the Commonwealth Games he first represented Northern Ireland, then later competed for England.\nHis personal best in the event is 48.54 seconds, set in 2003. As things stand it currently makes Douglas the 4th fastest Briton of all time over this distance.\nDouglas suffered from several injury problems towards the end of his career which forced him into early retirement.  He then dedicated his time to taking over his family's solicitor practice.\nHe has a degree in Sports Sciences from Brunel University London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 6 || 5 ||align=\"left\"| Matthew Douglas ||align=\"left\"|  || 49.77 || ", "| 27 ||align=\"left\"| Matthew Douglas ||align=\"left\"|  || 49.77 || "]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Matthew Douglas"]}, {"page": "1995 European Athletics Junior Championships", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas|| 51.73"]}, {"page": "England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas", "|Andrew SteeleMartyn RooneyMatthew DouglasRobert TobinMarlon Devonish"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2003 Summer Universiade", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas || 49.26"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 13 || 4 ||align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 50.71 || Q", "| 12 || 2 ||align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 50.56 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["| 2 || 2 ||align=left|  ||align=left|Andrew Steele, Martyn Rooney, Matthew Douglas, Robert Tobin || 3:03.91 || Q"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2002 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 4 || 1 ||align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 49.38 || q, SB", "| 8 || align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 51.01 ||"]}, {"page": "The Radcliffe School", "response": ["* Matthew Douglas, GB 400m Hurdler"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2003 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas", "| 1 || 4 || align=\"left\" | Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 51.59 || Q", "| 1 || 1 || align=\"left\" | Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 48.54 || QEAA 2003 ranking", "|  || 3 || align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 49.26 ||"]}, {"page": "Matt Douglas", "response": ["#REDIRECTMatthew Douglas"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2001 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 16 || 2 || align=\"left\" | Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 50.59 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1999 Summer Universiade \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 26 || 5 || align=\"left\" | Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 52.07 ||"]}, {"page": "300 metres hurdles", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1998 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 110 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 16 || 3 ||align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 15.13 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1998 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 11 || 2 ||align=left| Matthew Douglas ||align=left|  || 50.20 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1998 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["| 7 || 1 ||align=left|  || align=left|Brian Forbes, Edward King, Matthew Douglas, Paul McBurney || 3:07.27 ||"]}, {"page": "1997 European Athletics U23 Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 4 || align=left | Matthew Douglas || align=left |  || 52.14 || "]}, {"page": "Douglas, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Douglas"]}, {"page": "2006 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas || 50.09"]}, {"page": "2003 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas || 49.41"]}, {"page": "1997 AAA Championships", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas || 51.70"]}, {"page": "List of Universiade medalists in athletics (men)", "response": ["|Matthew Douglas || 49.26"]}]}}
