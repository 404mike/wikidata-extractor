He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. The elder Sir Edmund was a slaveowner, who ran a number of sugar plantations in Jamaica, British Guiana and St Kitts. At the time of emancipation in the 1830s, the British government compensated him for the ownership of over 500 slaves on eight estates in the West Indies.The younger Edmund married Marianne Georgiana Dashwood on 11 February 1847, and with her had six children: Louisa Emma, Edmund (4th Baronet), Robert Lindsay, Cosmo (5th Baronet), and two other daughters.\nHis land included the ancient monument of Stonehenge. During his lifetime he refused to let the government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments even look at the property. It was rumoured that an anonymous buyer wanted to buy the stones and take them to the United States; if Antrobus had accepted the offer, no one could have stopped him. He was painted while hunting with the Old Surrey Fox Hounds at Addington, Surrey during his time as MP for the same area, by animal painter William Barraud.\nHe was elected as one of two MPs for East Surrey in 1841, won a re-election, then in 1847 both MPs were unseated by Liberal candidates. He was subsequently elected as a Whig/Liberal MP for Wilton in 1855, replacing an incumbent from the same party who had resigned to serve as a Special Commissioner in Ireland. He succeeded to the Baronetcy upon the death of his father on 4 May 1870. He was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1880. On his death the Baronetcy passed to his eldest son and namesake, Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antrobus baronets", "response": ["*Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet (1818\u20131899)"]}, {"page": "Edmund Antrobus", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet"]}, {"page": "Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet; MP for East Surrey (1841\u20131847)"]}, {"page": "Edmund Antrobus (disambiguation)", "response": ["Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet (1818\u20131899) was a British politician."]}, {"page": "Antrobus, Edmund", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet"]}, {"page": "Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet", "response": ["Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet, was born 25 December 1848.Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, 106th edition, 1999, volume I, p. 92 He was the son and heir of Sir Edmund Antrobus, 3rd Baronet, and Marianne Georgiana Dashwood, married on 11 February 1847."]}]}}
