William Losh built the first soda works in Britain at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works on the River Tyne in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large tariffs on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. James Muspratt's chemical works in Liverpool and Charles Tennant's complex near Glasgow became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined."]}, {"page": "Leblanc process", "response": ["By the early 19th century, French soda ash producers were making 10,000 - 15,000 tons annually.  However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process became most widely practiced.   The first British soda works using the Leblanc process was built by the Losh family of iron founders at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works in Walker on the River Tyne in 1816, but steep British tariffs on salt production hindered the economics of the Leblanc process and kept such operations on a small scale until 1824.  Following the repeal of the salt tariff, the British soda industry grew dramatically. The Bonnington Chemical Works was possibly the earliest production, and the chemical works established by James Muspratt in Liverpool and Flint, and by Charles Tennant near Glasgow became some of the largest in the world.  Muspratt's Liverpool works enjoyed proximity and transport links to the Cheshire salt mines, the St Helens coalfields and the North Wales and Derbyshire limestone quarries.Peter Reed, Acid Rain and the Rise of the Environmental Chemist in Nineteenth Century Britain, (2014), p. 94  By 1852, annual soda production had reached 140,000 tons in Britain and 45,000 tons in France.

The first solution was to build the Sankey Canal which opened in 1755 and ran from the Blackbrook canal via Parr to Sankey Bridges, to the west of Warrington.  It was extended to the west, to Fiddlers Ferry, five years later.Diggle, p. 17 Encouraged by the success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway which opened in 1825, in 1829 a group of local businessmen arranged for a survey for a line from Cowley Hill Colliery, north of St Helens, to Runcorn Gap on the River Mersey.  At this time the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which ran to the south of St Helens, was being built and its surveyor, Charles Blacker Vignoles, was commissioned to undertake the survey; he was later appointed as the engineer. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 29 May 1830.Holt, p. 59 The original capital was \u00a3120,000, one-third of which was raised from local coal owners, salt-makers and Liverpool merchants.Diggle, p. 18 These included James Muspratt, soap and alkali manufacturer, and Peter Greenall, who had interests in the brewing, coal and glass manufacturing industries.Hardie, p. 4 Peter Greenall was elected as the first chairman of a board of ten directors. At the south end of the railway, Widnes Dock was built, which led into the Mersey. This was the world's first rail-to-ship facility.Welbourn, p. 4 Because of perceived competition from the railway, the Sankey Canal was extended from Fiddlers Ferry to Runcorn Gap by what was known as the \"New Cut\". The railway terminated between the dock and the end of the canal and Runcorn Gap station was sited to the north of the canal.Hardie, frontispiece map."]}, {"page": "James Sheridan Muspratt", "response": ["James Sheridan Muspratt was born in Dublin and moved to Liverpool with his parents when he was one year old.
