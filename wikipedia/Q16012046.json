She played a key role in the launch of Today on BBC Radio 4, and served as its first senior producer.Benzie was born in 1902 in Glasgow and took the equivalent of a degree in German at Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. She then became a secretary at the BBC in 1927. This was just two years after it first had de facto national coverage in Britain. She was working for \u00a3150 a year as assistant to the head of the Foreign Liaison department, Major CF Atkinson. She was also gathering material for talks given by Vernon Bartlett on his programme The Way of the World. In 1932 Atkinson resigned and Benzie was given his role. Her salary increased to \u00a3500 a year but this was much less that her former boss had been paid. Benzie's career continued and her salary was increased by \u00a3100 every year with a ceiling being set at \u00a31,250 per year. In 1933 she was head of that department and in 1937 she married a BBC producer, Royston Morley. They had one child, a daughter. She had not been given a degree because she was a woman so she had to leave the BBC now that she was married to another of their employees. Another source says that she opted to leave and her resignation meal was attended by Lord Reith. The marital rule was relaxed during the war and she returned to organise talks on aspects of health.\nShe and Janet Quigley played a key role in October 1957 in the launch of Today on BBC Radio 4 which she had named. She edited the programme and was its first senior producer. She took it from a programme for \"people on the move\" to the important step of having its own named presenter. Quigley and Benzie complemented each other's careers. They worked in the same BBC departments, had the same alma mater and witnessed each other's marriage.Benzie retired in 1964 and died in St Leonards in 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Today (BBC Radio 4)", "response": ["Today was launched on the BBC's Home Service on 28 October 1957 as a programme of \"topical talks\" to give listeners an alternative to listening to light music. The programme's founders were Isa Benzie and Janet Quigley. Benzie gave the programme its name, and served as its first de facto editor.Paul Donovan, \u2018Benzie, Isa Donald (1902\u20131988)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 4 March 2017 It was initially broadcast as two 20-minute editions slotted in around the existing news bulletins and religious and musical items. It became part of the BBC's Current Affairs department in 1963, and started to become more news-orientated. The two editions also became longer, and by the end of the 1960s it had become a single programme two hours in length that enveloped the news bulletins and the religious talk that had become Thought for the Day in 1970.Lizzie Clifford \"Thought for the Day\u2019: Beyond the god-of-the-slots\", Ekklesia [c.2009] In May 1977, Radio 4 controller Ian McIntyre cut it to two 25-minute parts, filling the gap with Up to the Hour. The new format was unpopular with BBC staff, including Peter Donaldson who on at least one occasion openly ridiculed the programme on air. It also provoked comments in the diary columns of the daily newspapers. From July 1978, Today returned to its previous length and Up to the Hour was dropped."]}, {"page": "Donald Winnicott", "response": ["During the Second World War, Winnicott served as consultant paediatrician to the children's evacuation programme. During the war, he met and worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker who became his colleague in treating children displaced from their homes by wartime evacuation. Winnicott was lecturing after the war and Janet Quigley and Isa Benzie of the BBC asked him to give over sixty talks on the radio between 1943 and 1966. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled \"Happy Children.\" As a result of the success of these talks, Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch."]}, {"page": "Isa Donald Benzie", "response": ["#redirectIsa Benzie"]}, {"page": "Royston Morley", "response": ["His early work for BBC television, beginning in 1937, included a regular slot in Cecil Madden's \"Picture Page\", a magazine programme of general and topical interest.\"Royston Morley\", BBC Genome.
