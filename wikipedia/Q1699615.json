He murdered at least eight people\u2014including his wife, Ethel\u2014by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London. The bodies of three of Christie's victims were found in a wallpaper-covered kitchen alcove soon after Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953. The remains of two more victims were discovered in the garden, and his wife's body was found beneath the floorboards of the front room. Christie was arrested and convicted of his wife's murder, for which he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed.\nTwo of Christie's victims were Beryl Evans and her baby daughter Geraldine, who, along with Beryl's husband, Timothy Evans, were tenants at 10 Rillington Place during 1948\u201349. This case sparked huge controversy after Evans was charged with both murders, found guilty of the murder of his daughter, and hanged in 1950. Christie was a major prosecution witness; when his own crimes were discovered three years later, serious doubts were raised about the integrity of Evans's conviction. Christie himself subsequently admitted killing Beryl, but not Geraldine; it is now generally accepted that Christie murdered both Beryl and Geraldine and that police mishandling of the original inquiry allowed Christie to escape detection and enabled him to murder four more women. The High Court quashed Evans's conviction in 2004, accepting that Evans did not murder either his wife or his child.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "10 Rillington Place (site)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Christie (serial killer)"]}, {"page": "John Reginald Christie", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Christie (serial killer)"]}, {"page": "Timothy Evans", "response": ["During his trial, Evans accused his downstairs neighbour, John Christie, who was the chief prosecution witness, of committing the murders. ", "In 1935, his mother and her second husband moved to London, and Evans worked as a painter and decorator while attending school. He returned to Merthyr Tydfil in 1937 and briefly worked in the coal mines but had to resign because of continuing problems with his foot. In 1939, he returned to London to live again with his mother, and in 1946 they moved to St Mark's Road, Notting Hill. This was just over two minutes' walk from 10 Rillington Place, his future residence after he married. Evans was fined 60 shillings at West London Magistrates court on 25 April 1946 for stealing a car, and driving without insurance or a licence.Jonathan Oates - John Christie of Rillington Place page 45.", "On 20 September 1947, Evans married Beryl Susanna Thorley, whom he had met in January 1947 on a blind date.The Murders of the Black Museum pp 464\u2013465 The couple initially lived with Evans's family at St Mark's Road but after Beryl discovered she was pregnant in 1948 they moved into the top-floor flat at 10\u00a0Rillington Place in the Ladbroke Grove area of Notting Hill. Their neighbours in the ground-floor flat were the serial killer John Christie, then working as a post office clerk, and his wife, Ethel Christie. Timothy's and Beryl's daughter Geraldine was born on 10 October 1948.The Murders of the Black Museum p. 465", "The safety of Evans's conviction was severely criticised when Christie's murders were discovered three years later. During interviews with police and psychiatrists prior to his execution, Christie admitted several times that he had been responsible for the murder of Beryl Evans. If these confessions were true, Evans's second statement detailing Christie's offer to abort Beryl's baby is likely to be the true version of events that took place at Rillington Place on 8 November 1949. Ludovic Kennedy provided one possible reconstruction of how the murder took place, surmising that an unsuspecting Beryl let Christie into her flat, expecting the abortion to be carried out, but was instead attacked and then strangled.Kennedy, Ten Rillington Place, p. 65 Christie claimed to have possibly engaged in sexual intercourse with Beryl's body after her death (he claimed to be unable to remember the precise details) but her post-mortem had failed to uncover evidence of sexual intercourse.Brabin, Rillington Place, pp. 62\u201363.  Kennedy (p. 137) argued that there was evidence that sexual intercourse had been performed on Beryl Evans after death, pointing to a brief from Evans's legal team saying so. As Eddowes, J. (pp. 117\u2013124) highlights, the pathologist, Dr Teare, on whose work the brief was based, denied this is what he meant and that the evidence referred to pointed rather to a self-inflicted injury carried out by Beryl to abort herself. In his confessions to Beryl's death, Christie denied he had agreed to carry out an abortion on Beryl. He instead claimed to have strangled her while being intimate with her, or that she had wanted to commit suicide and he helped her do so.Marston, John Christie, pp. 85\u201386", "One important fact was not brought up in Evans's trial: two workmen were willing to testify that there were no bodies in the wash-house when they worked there several days after Evans supposedly hid them.John Christie of Rillington Place: Biography of a Serial Killer p. 73 They stored their tools in the wash-room (a small outhouse measuring ) and cleaned it out completely when they finished their work on 11 November. Their evidence in itself would have raised doubts about the veracity of Evans's alleged confessions, but the workmen were not called to give evidence. Indeed, the police re-interviewed the workmen and forced them to change their evidence to fit the preconceived idea that Evans was the sole murderer. The murderer, Christie, would have hidden the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine in the temporarily vacant first-floor flat, and then moved them to the wash-house four days later when the workmen had finished.", "==John Christie==", "* The film 10 Rillington Place was released in the UK on 10 February 1971.
