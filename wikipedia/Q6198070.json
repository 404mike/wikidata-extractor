Bird set off from San Francisco, California and arrived at the Great Barrier Reef Australia 294 days later on 14 June 1983. Bird would later die attempting the west to east journey across the Pacific. Briton Jim Shekhdar later made the claim to be \"the first person to row across the Pacific single-handed\". Shekhdar had rowed across the Pacific non-stop, solo and unassisted arriving in Australia on 30 March 2001. Some within the sport felt that Shekhdar had not given due credit to the achievement of Peter Bird and the term \"unassisted\" also came under some scrutiny."]}, {"page": "Jim Shekdar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Shekhdar"]}]}}
