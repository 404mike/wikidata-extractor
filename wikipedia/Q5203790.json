H. Asquith, whom he later described as having \"intellectual sincerity and moral nobility\", and particularly of Asquith's successor, David Lloyd George, whom he regarded as a \"man of action\", likely to accomplish his goals.D. R. Thorpe, Supermac(Chatto & Windus, 2010).", "In later life Macmillan was open about his failure to read Eisenhower's thoughts correctly and much regretted the damage done to Anglo-American relations, but always maintained that the Anglo-French military response to the nationalisation of the Canal had been for the best.Williams, Harold Macmillan (2009) p. 267 D. R. Thorpe rejects the charge that Macmillan deliberately played false over Suez (i.e. encouraged Eden to attack in order to destroy him as Prime Minister), noting that Macmillan privately put the chances of success at 51\u201349.Thorpe 2010, p. 356", "Macmillan tried, but failed, to see Eisenhower (who was also refusing to see Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd) behind Butler's and Eden's back. Macmillan had a number of meetings with US Ambassador Winthrop Aldrich, in which he said that if he were Prime Minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan (\"A straight, fine man, and so far as he is concerned, the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war\").Howard 1987, p. 242Thorpe 2010, pp. 352\u201353 Eisenhower said these words in a meeting with Treasury Secretary Humphrey (who was pro-Butler), Under Secretary of State Hoover and Staff Secretary Andrew Goodpaster. It is unclear whether there was direct pressure from the US Administration for Macmillan to be chosen, or rather whether being the candidate best placed to rebuild bridges with the Americans was simply another reason why leading Conservatives preferred him to Butler. Published accounts do not agree about the date of the meeting. Williams (2008, p. 270) lists it as happening on 20 November, a date repeated in Michael Jago's 2015 biography of Rab Butler. Macmillan's other recent biographer D. R. Thorpe gives it as 24 December, presumably an error as the footnote refers to Eisenhower's papers for November 1956, while in his biography of Anthony Eden (2003, p. 539) Thorpe gives it as 24 November.", "Besides foreign affairs, the economy was Macmillan's other prime concern.Edmund Dell, The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390 (1997) pp. 223\u2013303. His One Nation approach to the economy was to seek high or full employment, especially with a general election looming. This contrasted with the Treasury ministers who argued that support of sterling required spending cuts and, probably, a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958 the three Treasury ministers\u2014Peter Thorneycroft, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Birch, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Enoch Powell, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and seen as their intellectual ringleader\u2014resigned. D. R. Thorpe argues that this, coming after the resignations of Labour ministers Aneurin Bevan, John Freeman and Harold Wilson in April 1951 (who had wanted higher expenditure), and the cuts made by Butler and Macmillan as Chancellors in 1955\u201356, was another step in the development of \"stop-go\" economics, as opposed to prudent medium-term management.Thorpe 2010, pp. 401\u201307 Macmillan, away on a tour of the Commonwealth, brushed aside this incident as \"a little local difficulty\". He bore no grudge against Thorneycroft and brought him and Powell, of whom he was more wary, back into the government in 1960.Thorpe 2010, p. 407", "By the early 1960s, many were starting to find Macmillan's courtly and urbane Edwardian manners anachronistic, and satirical journals such as Private Eye and the television show That Was the Week That Was mercilessly mocked him as a doddering, clueless leader.Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.179 Macmillan's handling of the Vassall affair \u2013 in which an Admiralty clerk, John Vassall, was convicted in October 1962 of passing secrets to the Soviet Union \u2013 undermined his \"Super-Mac\" reputation for competence. D. R. Thorpe writes that from January 1963 \"Macmillan's strategy lay in ruins\", leaving him looking for a \"graceful exit\". The Vassall affair turned the press against him.Thorpe 2010, p. 613 In the same month, opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell died suddenly at the age of 56. With a general election due before the end of the following year, Gaitskell's death threw the future of British politics into fresh doubt. In the following month Harold Wilson was elected as the new Labour leader, and he proved to be a popular choice with the public.", "D. R. Thorpe writes that by the early 1960s Macmillan was seen as \"the epitome of all that was wrong with anachronistic Britain. This was an unfair charge.\" \"The essence of his persona was as elusive as mercury.\" He was not a member of \"the Establishment\"\u2014in fact he was a businessman who had married into the aristocracy and a rebel Chancellor of Oxford. \"He had style in abundance, (and) was a star on the world stage\".

Macmillan's official biographer Alistair Horne believed that Macleod's description of 17 October as \"the key day\" is evidence that he \"changed his mind\", having not previously had a particularly firm opinion. Macmillan's view was \"well, you know \u2026 Macleod was a Highlander!\" Others (e.g. Macmillan's biographer D. R.

Lady Avon's brother John had once been engaged to Betjeman's wife, then Penelope Chetwode, daughter of Field Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode: see Clarissa Eden (2007) A Memoir. According to Wilson, Penelope's love for John Churchill had \"waned\".  Waugh enquired of Clarissa Eden, \"Did you never think that you were contributing to the loneliness of Calvary by your desertion [of the faith]?\"", "Eden's premiership lasted less than two years.  For much of this period Eden was the subject of hostility from elements of the Conservative press, notably The Daily Telegraph,For example, Donald McLachlan, The Daily Telegraph, 3 January 1956 the wife of whose chairman, Lady Pamela Berry (an ambitious and sometimes spiteful society hostess, described by the biographer of her father, Lord Birkenhead, as \"the politician manqu\u00e9e of the second generation\"John Campbell (1983) F. E. Smith, First Earl of Birkenhead. According to a more recent historian, Lady Pamela was \"an able, ambitious woman who slaked her frustration at being denied formal responsibilities and power by outrushes of political malice\": Richard Davenport-Hines (2013) An English Affair.), was said by some to have had a \"blood row\" (Macmillan's phrase) with Lady Avon.Pamela Berry was another of Lady Avon's acquaintances who had taken accommodation at the Dorchester Hotel during the Second World War: see Darling Monster: The Letters of Lady Diana Cooper to her Son John Julius Norwich 1939\u20131952 (op.cit.).  The latter's attempts to make up this puzzling rift were apparently shunned.Harold Macmillan, diary 26 July 1956; D. R. Thorpe (2003) Eden. It is worth noting that, in 1962, Nancy Mitford, who had once been very close to Lady Pamela, wrote to Evelyn Waugh that \"she is spoilt \u2026 her faults are getting worse and she doesn't mellow\" (Laura Thompson (2003) Life in a Cold Climate).  In the same year, Waugh observed that \"Pam joins Randolph [Churchill] among the legion of the damned\" after she had apparently betrayed a confidence in the columns of The Daily Telegraph [ibid]. Lady Pamela died in 1982, but there have been suggestions that, in 1988, a Telegraph obituary of Beryl Maudling, widow of Reginald Maudling, Eden's Minister of Supply and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Macmillan, was \"unnecessarily spiteful\" because, as Maudling's biographer put it, of \"some personal matter connected with the Maudlings' relationship with the Berry family\": Lewis Baston (2004) Reggie, footnote 5 to chapter 27.", "In April 1956 Lady Avon hosted a dinner at Chequers for the visiting Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin.  Khrushchev noted that Lady Avon's (sober) behaviour contradicted a briefing from the Soviet Embassy in London that she shared some of Winston Churchill's \"traits in the matter of drinking\". Over dinner (when, according to his hostess, he ate nothing despite his reputation for eating and drinking greedilyMacmillan's view, quoted in D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac. Macmillan regarded such greed as an indication of Khruschev's inner character, rather as Anthony Eden had taken a similar view of Benito Mussolini's objectionable table manners in the 1930s (Thorpe, ibid.)), he responded rather bluntly to her question about the range of Soviet missiles that \"they could easily reach your island and quite a bit farther\".Khrushchev Remembers (into. Edward Crankshaw, 1971).  Khrushchev noted that Lady Avon \"bit her tongue\" at this answer, which he admitted was \"a bit rude\".  The following morning Khrushchev mistook Lady Avon's room for Bulganin's but, having provoked a cry after almost walking in on her, beat a hasty retreat and did not identify himself.  He confided later in Bulganin with whom he \"had a good laugh over the incident\".Khrushchev Remembers (1971)", "During this period there were some who thought they detected undue influence by Lady Avon over her husband. For example, Lady Jebb, wife of the British Ambassador in Paris, alluded in her diary to Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth and referred to \"Clarissa's war\".The Diaries of Cynthia Gladwyn, ed Miles Jebb (1995) (It should be borne in mind, however, that her husband, Sir Gladwyn, a \"figure of some grandeur, if not hauteur\",D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan, page 472, note 35 was furious at his exclusion from an Anglo-French summit in Paris two weeks before the Suez invasion.See Turner (2006) Suez 1956; Thorpe (2010) Supermac. Thorpe referred to Jebb's further sidelining at the disastrous Paris summit of 1960 during which Macmillan, having rejected official advice, visited Khrushchev at the Soviet Embassy with only two of his private secretaries in attendance.) In December 1956 Walter Monckton, a member of Eden's Government who opposed the Suez invasion, apparently told a Labour Member of Parliament, Anthony Wedgwood Benn, that Lady Avon was a powerful force in politics, with great influence on her husband, and that \"now she knows he [Monckton] opposed Anthony she won't have anything to do with him\".Tony Benn, diary, 15 December 1956: Benn (1994) Years of Hope: Diaries, Papers and Letters 1949\u20131962 Monckton claimed, among other things, that, during a rail strike in 1955, Eden, by then Prime Minister, had, at his wife's urging, taken a tougher public stance in relation to the railwaymen than that advised by Monckton, as Minister of Labour, and senior civil servantsBenn, op. cit.; David Kynaston (2009) Family Britain 1951\u201357 (although there is evidence that Churchill had also privately advocated to Eden the need for a strong line).Andrew Roberts (1994) Eminent Churchillians", "Less dramatically, there were suggestions that Eden's touchiness and over-sensitivity to criticism, characteristics frequently remarked upon by colleagues,For example, Anthony Nutting (1967) No End of a Lesson; Lord Butler (1971) The Art of the Possible; Lord Boyle in Alan Thompson (1971) The Day Before Yesterday; W. F. Deedes (2004) Brief Lives were exacerbated by Lady Avon (described by historian Barry Turner, without explanation, as \"equally touchy\"Barry Turner (2006) Suez 1956). One of Eden's private secretaries claimed that \"she had a habit of stirring up Anthony when he didn't need it\".Sir Philip de Zulueta, quoted in Alistair Horne (1988) Macmillan, Volume I: 1894\u20131956 However, Eden's biographer D. R. Thorpe concluded that such imputations arose from a misreading of the Edens' relationship, noting also that, during Suez, the only two people in whom Eden could confide without inhibition were his wife and the Queen. Indeed, as historian Ben Pimlott put it, \"if Lady Eden came to believe that the Suez Canal flowed through her drawing room, the Queen must have felt pretty damp as well\".Ben Pimlott (1996) The Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth II David Dutton, another (not notably sympathetic) biographer of Eden, noted that \"some observers believed that Clarissa was excessively protective and tended to exacerbate Eden's natural volatility\" but also remarked on her devoted companionship and that \"during the dark days of the Suez Crisis, [she] was at his side, supportive throughout\".David Dutton (1997) Anthony Eden: A Life and Reputation. Whatever effect Lady Avon had on Eden's temperament, it has been far from uncommon for Prime Ministerial behaviour to be influenced by protective spouses. Despite strong evidence of Sarah Brown's calming influence on her husband, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010, it has been suggested that \"her intense love and protection ... made her deeply angry when he was under attack, and this could heighten his paranoia about those who were seeking to do him down\": Anthony Seldon & Guy Lodge (2010) Brown at 10. It is clear also that, at various stages before and during the Falklands War of 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received from her husband, Denis, the sort of moral support that it was difficult for others to provide: Charles Moore (2013) Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography \u2013 Volume One: Not for Turning; Jonathan Aitken (2013) Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality.", "The Edens flew back to England just before Christmas 1956. A young witness of their departure from Kingston airport recalled Lady Eden looking \"glacial\" and her husband, pale.Susanna Johnson, The Oldie, October 2016, page 18. Twenty-year old Johnson, then Susanna Chancellor, had won a competition in the Daily Mirror newspaper about \"how to solve the Suez crisis\", the prize for which was a holiday in Jamaica to coincide with the Edens' sojourn. Lady Avon noted that, on their return, \"everyone [was] looking at us with thoughtful eyes\".Diary, 14 December 1956, quoted in D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan Early in January 1957, the Edens stayed with the Queen at Sandringham, where Sir Anthony informed her of his intention to resign as Prime Minister.Ben Pimlott (1996) The Queen Eden tendered his resignation formally at Buckingham Palace on 9 January. When Harold Macmillan was appointed his successor in preference to R. A. Butler, Lady Avon wrote to Butler (whom two years earlier she had described in her diary as \"curiously unnatural\"Diary, 26 January 1955: Clarissa Eden (2007) A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden) that she thought politics \"a beastly profession ... and how greatly I admire your dignity and good humour\".Butler (1971) The Art of the Possible. Writing to Eden on 10 January 1956 to say \"goodbye with all my affection to you and to Clarissa\", the future Prime Minister Lord Home observed that \"politics is in some ways a nasty profession ...\" (quoted in D. R. Thorpe (1996) Alec Douglas-Home). (In 1952 she had told Duff Cooper that she thought modern politics something of a \"farce\".)", "Macmillan's biographer Alistair Horne noted that, of the various animosities that arose before and during Macmillan's premiership, it was the \"loyal wives\", among whom he counted Lady Avon and Lady Butler, who \"tended most to keep [them] alive\".Alistair Horne (1989) Macmillan: Volume II 1957\u20131986 Although there is evidence of a long-standing and lasting rift between Eden and Macmillan,See, for example, D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan, citing Martin Gilbert's research for his biographical study of Churchill Eden himself maintained \"a friendly (if not conspicuously warm) relationship\" with his successor, often being used as a \"sounding board\" by Macmillan who occasionally lunched with the Edens at their home.D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan Lady Avon, on the other hand, was said to have been consistently vitriolic about Macmillan and recalled to one of Eden's biographers that Churchill had found him too \"viewy\".D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac. Thorpe produced biographies of both Eden and Macmillan. There is some evidence that, following Suez, Macmillan had briefed sections of the press that he himself intended to retire, whereas his true intention had been to displace Eden as Prime Minister,Davenport-Hines, op.cit. and, as late as 2007, Lady Avon criticised his behaviour as Chancellor of the Exchequer during the crisis, claiming that he had been \"too hasty\" in using an American threat to withhold a loan from the International Monetary Fund as \"an excuse to back down\" from military action and had wept \"crocodile tears\" at Eden's resignation.Daily Telegraph, 21 October 2007. Vice-President Richard Nixon was evidently the source of Eisenhower's regrets: see editorial note in Clarissa Eden (2007) A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden. According to Jonathan Aitken, Macmillan advised Margaret Thatcher in 1982 to exclude the Chancellor of the Exchequer from her Falklands War Cabinet to avoid Treasury influence on decision making: Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality, op.cit.", "When Eden was taken mortally ill with liver cancer, he and Lady Avon had just spent their final Christmas together at Hobe Sound, Florida as guests of former New York Governor Averell Harriman, elder statesman of the Democratic Party, and his English-born wife Pamela.

As a relatively youthful politician among mostly much older men, he appeared fashionably dressed, even flamboyant. In 1936 the American magazine Time referred to his \"pin-stripe trousers, modish short jacket and swank black felt hat\", worn during a diplomatic mission to the League of Nations in Geneva. Many remarked too on Eden's \"film star\" appeal, even as late as the 1950sSee, for example, Harold Macmillan, Diary 13\u201315 August 1952 (ed. Peter Catterall, 2003) when, as Prime Minister, he retained his youthful good looks.For example, Cecil Beaton, Diary, October 1956 (quoted in Hugo Vickers (1994) Loving Garbo) His biographer D. R. Thorpe, who likened the young Eden to a mixture of Sir Galahad (Eden won the Military Cross in the First World War) and Beau Brummel (the Regency dandy in whose London house Eden lived for a time), commented on a photograph of him, arriving in Russia by train in hat and fur-lined coat in 1935, that \"it seemed to some as if Tolstoy's Count Vronsky [a glamorous character in the novel Anna Karenina] were alighting at the platform\".", "Some contemporary observers thought they detected a \"prima donna\" streak in Eden's attitude and appearance. For example, the ageing Earl of Crawford and Balcarres (1871\u20131940), a snob,His snobbery was such that he had professed himself unable to imagine \"anything more middle class\" than the contents of a greenhouse on King George V's estate at Sandringham. Diary entry following a visit to Sandringham in 1923: see David Faber (2005) Speaking for England thought him \"vain as a peacock and all the mannerisms of a petit ma\u00eetre [in the sense of a dandy or fop]\". One of Eden's permanent secretaries, P. J. Grigg, who rarely had a good word to say of anyone, dismissed him as \"a poor feeble little pansy\".Sir James Grigg, Permanent Under-Secretary at the War Office where Eden was Secretary of State in 1940: Max Hastings (2009) Finest Years: Churchill as Warlord 1939\u201345. Hastings couples the \"pansy\" reference (with its effeminate or homosexual connotations) with the unexplained observation that \"soldiers thought him incorrigibly \"wet\" with affectations of manner which they identified with homosexuals\". It may be that, seventy or more years ago, Eden's alleged \"feminine\" side, manner of dress, habit of calling men \"my dear\" (a trait detested by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in the 1950s), dislike of men's clubs and cultivated interest in art and flowers, encouraged such a view. In fact, Eden's well-attested courage, including his military cross from the First World War, and (notwithstanding an apparent expression of doubt in 1955 about Eden's ability to be an effective Prime Minister) Churchill's long-standing belief in him (see Colville (1981) The Churchillians), tend to belie the charge of wetness. And, despite historian Michael Bloch's reference to Eden's having gone through a \"queer\" phase in his twenties (Closet Queens, 2015) and an unreferenced suggestion that he may have propositioned fellow Etonian Edward Gathorne-Hardy, four years his junior, while at Oxford (see D. J. Taylor (2007) Bright Young Things), there is ample evidence that, in addition to being intensely attractive to women, Eden sometimes pursued his relationships with them to the point of recklessness: see, generally, Rhodes James (1986) and Thorpe (2003); also Douglas Hurd (2010) Choose Your Weapons: The British Foreign Secretary who noted that Eden was \"charming and successful with women\" and lacked any cohort of male friends, either personal or political. Even his future, much younger second wife confided to her friend Duff Cooper that Eden, with whom she was not then coupled, \"never stops trying to make love to her\" (Duff Cooper, diary, 24 November 1947, quoted in The Duff Cooper Diaries 1915\u20131951 (ed John Julius Norwich, 2005)), while, in 1983, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher apparently remarked to her Party Chairman Cecil Parkinson, who had been having an affair with his secretary, that \"they tell me Anthony Eden jumped into bed with every good-looking woman he ever met\" (Jonathan Aitken (2013) Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality). Eden's second son, Nicholas, who succeeded him as Earl of Avon, was homosexual and died of AIDS in 1985: see, for example, Gyles Brandreth, diary, 21 January 1979 (The Diary of a Lifetime, 2009). Less prosaically, W. F. Deedes, a Minister in Eden's Government who, as a journalist, had once commented unfavourably on the colour of Eden's socks,Dear Bill (BBC TV, 1994) remarked half a century later that, in the modern vernacular, Eden would have been called a \"smoothie\".Suez: A Very British Crisis (BBC TV, 16 October 2006) The philosopher Bertrand Russell thought Eden \"not a gentleman\" because he dressed \"too well\",Quoted in The Times, 10 October 2009 while a Ministerial colleague R. A. Butler, alluding to Eden's parentage and highly strung nature, is said to have remarked, \"that's Anthony  half mad baronet, half beautiful woman\".Quoted in Patrick Cosgrave (1981) R. A. Butler; Wikiquote. There has been speculation over the years that, in fact, Eden may have owed his looks to George Wyndham, a politician and aesthete whom he was considered by some to closely resemble, and with whom his mother was rumoured to have had an affair: see, e.g., John Charmely (1989) Chamberlain and the Lost Peace. Eden's most recent biographer notes that Eden could have inherited his temper and aesthetic sensibilities from either Wyndham or Sir William Eden: D.R. Thorpe (2003) Eden.However, Butler had a habit of making such observations, once asking historian Richard Thorpe, \"How was Harold Macmillan when you met him? Was he the Duke's son-in-law or the crofter's great-grandson?\": D. R. Thorpe (2010) Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan", "In 1951, two days after Eden's re-appointment as Foreign Secretary, Vicky had, in similar vein, employed the imagery of Antony and Cleopatra to represent Eden approaching the Egyptian throne in suit and hat. King Farouk (overthrown in 1952) and the ancient Queen Cleopatra, as the embodiment of the Egyptian state, were shown to have torn up the treaty of 1936 which provided for Britain's military presence in the Suez Canal zone.29 October 1951: see D.

R. Thorpe (2003) Eden. Biographer D. R. Thorpe described the Suez Crisis as \"a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career.\"Thorpe (2003) Eden.", "There was speculation for many years that Eden's biological father was the politician and man of letters George Wyndham, but this is considered impossible as Wyndham was in South Africa at the time of Eden's conception.D. R. Thorpe, Eden, (Robert) Anthony, first earl of Avon (1897\u20131977)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2011. Eden's mother was rumoured to have had an affair with Wyndham. His mother and Wyndham exchanged affectionate communications in 1896 but Wyndham was an infrequent visitor to Windlestone and probably did not reciprocate Sybil's feelings. Eden was amused by the rumours but, according to his biographer Rhodes James, probably did not believe them. He did not resemble his siblings, but his father Sir William attributed this to his being \"a Grey, not an Eden\".Rhodes James 1986, pp. 16\u201318.", "Biographer D. R. Thorpe says Eden's four goals were to secure the canal; to make sure it remained open and that oil shipments would continue; to depose Nasser; and to prevent the USSR from gaining influence. \"The immediate consequence of the crisis was that the Suez Canal was blocked, oil supplies were interrupted, Nasser's position as the leader of Arab nationalism was strengthened, and the way was left open for Russian intrusion into the Middle East.Thorpe 2010, pp. 357\u2013358.", "Michael Foot pushed for a special inquiry along the lines of the Parliamentary Inquiry into the Attack on the Dardanelles in the First World War, although Harold Wilson (Labour Prime Minister 1964\u201370 and 1974\u201376) regarded the matter as a can of worms best left unopened. This talk ceased after the defeat of the Arab armies by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967, after which Eden received a lot of fanmail telling him that he had been right, and his reputation, not least in Israel and the United States, soared.Rhodes James 1986, pp. 612\u2013614. In 1986 Eden's official biographer Robert Rhodes James re-evaluated sympathetically Eden's stance over SuezRobert Rhodes James (1986) Anthony Eden. and in 1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, James asked: \"Who can now claim that Eden was wrong?\".Letter, The Daily Telegraph, 7 August 1990. Such arguments turn mostly on whether, as a matter of policy, the Suez operation was fundamentally flawed or whether, as such \"revisionists\" thought, the lack of American support conveyed the impression that the West was divided and weak. Anthony Nutting, who resigned as a Foreign Office Minister over Suez, expressed the former view in 1967, the year of the Arab\u2013Israeli Six-Day War, when he wrote that \"we had sown the wind of bitterness and we were to reap the whirlwind of revenge and rebellion\".Anthony Nutting (1967) No End of a Lesson Conversely, Jonathan Pearson argues in Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble (2002) that Eden was more reluctant and less bellicose than most historians have judged. D. R. Thorpe, another of Eden's biographers, writes that Suez was \"a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his careers\"; he suggests that had the Suez venture succeeded, \"there would almost certainly have been no Middle East war in 1967, and probably no Yom Kippur War in 1973 also\".D.
