Actual rapier combat was hardly the lightning thrust and parry depicted. Director Richard Lester and fight choreographer William Hobbs attempted to more closely match traditional rapier technique in The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers. Since then, many newer movies, like The Princess Bride and La Reine Margot have used rapiers rather than later weapons, although the fight choreography has not always accurately portrayed historical fencing techniques. Rapiers are also often featured in various video games, in particular role-playing games set in medieval- and Renaissance-inspired worlds."]}, {"page": "1977 in film", "response": ["| The Duellists || Paramount Pictures / Enigma Productions / National Film Finance Consortium || Ridley Scott (director); Gerald Vaughan-Hughes (screenplay); Keith Carradine, Harvey Keitel, Albert Finney, Tom Conti, Edward Fox, Cristina Raines, Robert Stephens, John McEnery, Arthur Dignam, Diana Quick, Alun Armstrong, Maurice Colbourne, Gay Hamilton, Meg Wynn Owen, Jenny Runacre, Alan Webb, Matthew Guinness, Dave Hill, William Hobbs, W.

Since silent movies were no proper medium for long dialogues, the classic stories about heroes who would defend their honour with sword in hand were simplified and sheer action would gain priority.
