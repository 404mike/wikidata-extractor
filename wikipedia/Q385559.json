Initially composing for installations and dance companies, since 1995 he has released music on the UK label Touch. He has collaborated with artists such as Gavin Bryars, Jah Wobble, Jaki Liebezeit, David Sylvian, and Janek Schaefer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Turntablism", "response": ["The use of the turntable as a musical instrument has its roots dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when musique concr\u00e8te composers did experiments with audio equipment. Experimental composers (such as John Cage, Halim El-Dabh, and Pierre Schaeffer) used them to sample and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage's Imaginary Landscape No. 1 (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and cymbal. Edgard Var\u00e8se experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s-2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as Christian Marclay, Janek Schaefer, Otomo Yoshihide, Philip Jeck, and Maria Chavez. Turntablism as it is known today, however, did not surface until the advent of hip hop in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "List of noise musicians", "response": ["*Philip Jeck"]}, {"page": "Jaki Liebezeit", "response": ["In 1980, he became a member of Phantomband, and formed drum ensembles such as Drums off Chaos and Club off Chaos.

He names the Caretaker as a key hauntology artist, alongside \"William Basinski, the Ghost Box label...Burial, Mordant Music, Philip Jeck, amongst others\" who had \"converged on a certain terrain without directly influencing one another...suffused with an overwhelming melancholy; and they were preoccupied with the way in which technology materialised memory\" - in the Caretaker's case, that of vinyl records. He identifies the \"crackle\" of vinyl as \"the principle sonic signature of hauntology\" which \"makes us aware that we are listening to a time that is out of joint\", signalling \"the return of a certain sense of loss\" which \"invokes the past and marks our distance from it\". Fisher connects the Caretaker's sound to his wider project of describing capitalist realism - the political idea that \"not only has the future not arrived, it no longer seems possible\", and hauntology's melancholia to capitalist realism's \"closed horizons\". Fisher contributed liner notes to Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia, describing it as \"uneasy listening\"; in contrast to the Caretaker's earlier works, \"the threat is no longer the deadly sweet seduction of nostalgia. The problem is not, any more, the longing to get *to* the past but the inability to get *out* of it\"."]}, {"page": "Sonic Arts Network", "response": ["Cut and Splice is a festival of experimental electronic music that brings together international artists to premiere new work or recreate seminal historical pieces.

Christian Marclay is a turntablist who has been using other people's records as the sole source of his music-making since the late 1970s. He often treats the records in unusual ways, for example, he has physically cut up a group of records and stuck them together, making both a visual and aural collage. Sometimes several spoken-word or lounge music records bought from thrift stores are mashed together to make a Marclay track, but his More Encores album cuts up tracks by the likes of Maria Callas and Louis Armstrong in a way similar to Oswald's work on Plunderphonics. Marclay's experimental approach has been taken up by the likes of Roberto Musci & Giovanni Venosta, Otomo Yoshihide, Philip Jeck and Martin T\u00e9treault, although in these artist's works the records used are sometimes heavily disguised and unrecognizable."]}, {"page": "Cris Cheek", "response": ["His music and sound collaborations include Slant (a trio with Philip Jeck and Sianed Jones).

It is unknown if Kirby added these echo filters or if they are a part of the original recordings, which Savage interpreted as giving the LP an \"affective\" vibe. As the album progresses, the samples become more fragmented and unnoticeable, the sounds stop staying at both stereo channels, and the tracks become shorter.
