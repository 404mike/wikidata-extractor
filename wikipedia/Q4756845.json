Orphaned, he was supported by William and placed in Heriot's Hospital, where he received an education. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to the goldsmith James Gilliland of Edinburgh, and various pieces of jewellery, mourning rings and the like, adorned with minute drawings on ivory by his hand, still exist.

At that time the university had a Europe wide reputation for its invigorating emphasis on experimental methods and intellectual stimulus. Soon after joining the university Darwin became friends with the up-and-coming clinical teacher Andrew Duncan, staying in his house and getting personal guidance as well as access to the wards of The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. He discussed his interests in letters to his father, commenting on new ideas and therapies in use. In April 1776 Erasmus wrote mentioning studies of the human pulse, and an unpublished manuscript What are the established varieties of the pulse, their causes & uses in medicine appears to have been one of Charles Darwin's earliest works, showing his abilities in observations of variations due to age or exercise, and a good grasp of the current literature on blood circulation. He submitted a dissertation on the distinction between mucus and pus for the first annual gold medal of the Aesculapian Society at Edinburgh, and won this medal in March 1778. His graduating dissertation, written as a conventional thesis in classical Latin, discussed the relationship between the lymphoid system and \"dropsy\", heart failure. As well as following the teachings on this subject in Edinburgh at that time, it showed his independent ideas and evidence from well considered experiments.", "Charles Darwin was buried in the family vault of his professor and mentor, Andrew Duncan MD, in the Burying Ground of the Parish Church of St Cuthbert's chapel of ease (later renamed Buccleuch Parish Church), sited on the south side of Edinburgh at 33 Chapel Street, not far from the Old College of the University of Edinburgh.", "In October 1825 the brothers Eras and Charles went to Edinburgh University, and in January they visited \"the old Dr. Duncan\", Charles wrote home \"What an extraordinary old man he is, now being past 80, & continuing to lecture\", though Dr. Hawley, who had shown them round the city, thought Duncan was now failing. In an 1879 biographical sketch of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin, he outlined his uncle's life, and said that \"Professor Andrew Duncan, in whose family vault Charles was buried, cut a lock of hair from the corpse, and took it to a jeweller, whose apprentice, afterwards the famous Sir H. Raeburn, set it in a locket for a memorial.

In 1805 John Abercrombie was appointed to the staff and established a large teaching practice there.", "Number ten, in the south-west  corner of Surgeons' Square, had been built for use as a lecture theatre for the physician Andrew Duncan senior. The anatomist  John Barclay bought the building in 1800 and began to teach anatomy. The house also contained a dissection room. His classes proved extremely popular and by the time he retired in 1825 he was teaching some 300 students per year. After Charles Bell left Edinburgh in 1808 and Alexander Monro secundus  retired from anatomy teaching at the university the same year, Barclay became the most popular anatomy teacher in Edinburgh. His popularity was further enhanced by the unpopularity of Alexander Monro tertius, who had succeeded his father in  the university chair.  Barclay had amassed a large collection of comparative anatomy specimens used for teaching and this collection was bought by the RCSEd to form the Barclay collection in their museum. Barclay was  succeeded in his anatomy school by Robert Knox. Knox catalogued the Barclay collection and the Charles Bell collection as curator of the Surgeons' Hall museum. The greatly enlarged collection was housed from 1832 in the new Surgeons' Hall which had been built to accommodate it. Knox was also a gifted anatomy teacher in marked contrast to Alexander Monro tertius at the university. Knox's classes were made more attractive by offering anatomical dissection under his supervision. As the demand for bodies for dissection exceeded supply, the serial killers William Burke and William Hare sold the bodies of their victims to Knox's anatomy school. After Burke was hanged for these crimes Knox was exonerated by a committee of 'distinguished citizens' and continued to teach at 10 Surgeons' Square until 1833. At the height of his popularity as a teacher in 1826, Knox attracted over 500 students to his anatomy classes, the largest number ever seen in the British Isles. William Fergusson assisted Knox with anatomy teaching until 1840 when he was appointed professor of surgery at King's College London and later became sergeant-surgeon to Queen Victoria."]}, {"page": "Andrew Duncan, the elder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Duncan (physician, born 1744)"]}]}}
