He made a total of 439 league appearances in a 15-year career in the Football League.\nBeginning his career at Stoke City in 1964, he moved on to Blackpool in 1968. He spent the next nine years with Blackpool, helping them to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1969\u201370, and to lift the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1971. He spent 1977 to 1980 at Port Vale, also briefly serving the club as caretaker-manager in 1979. He ended his career at non-league Stafford Rangers in 1981.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["There was unrest at Port Vale at the start of 1977\u201378, as Sammy Morgan and David Harris were so upset by the low wages they were offered that they refused to play for the club. Sproson brought in three players on free transfers: Jeff Hemmerman, Grahame McGifford, and Bill Bentley. However at a meeting on 28 June, Sproson was severely criticized for his supposed poor judgement of players and for seeming to place greater priority on his newsagent business than the club. The Sentinel reported that \"there is disenchantment in the air\", and there were rumours that former Stoke manager Tony Waddington would be brought in to replace Sproson. Sproson was sacked in October 1977 after a poor run of results. His replacement Bobby Smith failed to rescue Vale from relegation despite making numerous signings. England manager Don Revie had predicted such a fate when he said at a dinner that \"English football suffers from the same complaint all the time. You've got two local lads here as your management team [referring to Sproson and his assistant Reg Berks]. I'll tell you now, you won't give them enough money to get out of this division, but eventually you'll give them both the sack and then you'll give the next manager the lot.\""]}, {"page": "Harry Mowbray", "response": ["Mowbray began his career in his native Scotland with Cowdenbeath in 1966.
