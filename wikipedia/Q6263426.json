Johnstone/Johnston?, led a party of police to the \"Gravel Pits\" diggings in a determined raid to apprehend unlicensed miners, and were met with a shower of stones and the occasional pistol shot. Rede and the few police and militia not already engaged in the affray arrived on the scene. Rede reminded them that a commission of enquiry had been promised them to find a more equitable system, and urged restraint. He then read the Riot Act. Peter Lalor urged resistance and the miners marched to Eureka goldfield and erected the famous Eureka Stockade. On 3 December Captain John Wellesley Thomas and his men attacked the stockade, resulting in the death of 22 miners and nearly as many severely wounded. Knowing that his actions against the miners made him a likely target, Rede requested a transfer, and was give the post of deputy sheriff of Geelong, and promoted to sheriff in July 1857. There, as Major Rede, he organized the Geelong Rifles and, by the time he retired from the militia, had been promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. By 1869 his area of responsibility had expanded to encompass also Ballarat, Ararat and Belfast districts.
