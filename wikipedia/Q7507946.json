He was a pacy winger with good ball-control who created chances and was always involved in the game. He made 167 appearances in all competitions for Small Heath. In 1900\u201301 he played for the Football League XI against the Irish League and was a member of  an England XI in an unofficial international against a German XI, alongside clubmate Alex Leake.\nIn the 1901 Census, Wharton was listed as a professional footballer living in Dawson Street, Smethwick, Staffordshire. He later became a bookmaker, and is listed in that occupation on the 1939 Register. He died in Birmingham in January 1951 at the age of 75.He was the uncle of racing car driver Ken Wharton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Leake", "response": ["Leake made his Small Heath debut in October 1895 at left half, but from midway through that season (in which the club were relegated) for the following four years he rarely missed a game at centre-half.

When he did suffer an injury early in the 1899\u20131900 season, inside forward Walter Wigmore was tried at centre-half, and by the time Leake regained fitness, his position was taken. He played the remainder of his Small Heath career at left-half or occasionally inside-left. He helped the club gain promotion back to the First Division in 1901, but left at the end of the 1901\u201302 season when they were relegated again.
