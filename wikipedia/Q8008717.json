In a career lasting over 60 years, he served for 12 years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, spread over four terms beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, serving over 12 years.", "Born in 1809 in Liverpool, at 62 Rodney Street, William Ewart Gladstone was the fourth son of the wealthy slaveowner John Gladstone, and his second wife, Anne MacKenzie Robertson. He was named after a close friend of his father, William Ewart, another Liverpool merchant and the father of William Ewart, later a Liberal politician.Magnus 1954, p. 1 In 1835, the family name was changed from Gladstones to Gladstone by royal licence.

The income tax had legally expired but Gladstone proposed to extend it for seven years to fund tariff reductions:", "Gladstone had a complex ambivalence about Catholicism. He was attracted by its international success in majestic traditions. More important, he was strongly opposed to the authoritarianism of its pope and bishops, its profound public opposition to liberalism, and its refusal to distinguish between secular allegiance on the one hand and spiritual obedience on the other.Josef L. Altholz, \"The Vatican Decrees Controversy, 1874\u20131875.\" Catholic Historical Review 57.4 (1972): 593-605 online. The danger came when the pope or bishops attempted to exert temporal power, as in the Vatican decrees of 1870 as the climax of the papal attempt to control churches in different nations, despite their independent nationalism.H. S. C. Matthew, Gladstone: 1809\u20131898 (1997) p. 248.  On the other hand, when ritual practices in the Church of England\u2014such as vestments and incense\u2014came under attack as too ritualistic and too much akin to Catholicism, Gladstone strongly opposed passage of the Public Worship Regulation Act in 1874.David W. Bebbington, William Ewart Gladstone: Faith and Politics in Victorian Britain (1990) p. 226", "Gladstone altered his approach to religious problems, which always held first place in his mind. Before entering Parliament he had already substituted a high church Anglican attitude, with its dependence on authority and tradition, for the evangelical outlook of his boyhood, with its reliance upon the direct inspiration of the Bible. In middle life he decided that the individual conscience would have to replace authority as the inner citadel of the Church. That view of the individual conscience affected his political outlook and changed him gradually from a Conservative into a Liberal.David Bebbington,  William Ewart Gladstone: Faith and Politics in Victorian Britain (1993).", "The historian H. C. G. Matthew states that Gladstone's chief legacy lay in three areas: his financial policy, his support for Home Rule (devolution) that modified the view of the unitary state of the United Kingdom and his idea of a progressive, reforming party broadly based and capable of accommodating and conciliating varying interests, along with his speeches at mass public meetings.H.C.G.
