Several of her brothers were also golfers; Michael Scott won The Amateur Championship in 1933 towards the end of a long career, Osmund Scott was the runner-up in the same tournament in 1905, and Denys Scott also played.\nIn her first two championship wins, Lady Margaret Scott beat Issette Pearson, the founder and first Secretary of the Ladies' Golf Union.  She won by 7 & 5 in 1893 and 3 & 2 in 1894, then beat Emma Lythgoe 5 & 4 in 1895.  Thereafter, Scott retired from competitive golf.\nShe married the Hon. Frederick Gustavus Hamilton-Russell in 1897, and died in 1938 at the age of 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Womens Amateur Championship", "response": ["The first tournament was played at the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, England and was won by Lady Margaret Scott, who also won the following two years; her feat of three straight titles remains the record, matched by Cecil Leitch and Enid Wilson. In 1927, Simone de la Chaume of France, who had won the 1924 British Girls Amateur Golf Championship, became the first golfer from outside the British Isles to win the Ladies Championship. The first competitor from the United States to win the title was Babe Zaharias in 1947.", "In late 1892 several members of Wimbledon Ladies Golf Club sent out a circular to a number of other ladies clubs, with the intention of forming a ladies' golf union to arrange a ladies' championship similar to the men's Amateur Championship which had been held since 1885. Independently the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, who had not been sent the circular, decided to organise a ladies' championship. On becoming aware of this, the Lytham club was invited to attend the meeting of the new union. The outcome was that it was decided to hold the first ladies' championship at the Lytham club, under the auspices of the newly founded Ladies' Golf Union. The championship was held from Tuesday 13 to Thursday 15 June. It was played on the ladies links of the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, a 9-hole course. This was on the Mayfield Road site which the club used before moving to its present location in 1896. There were 38 entries, requiring 6 knock-out rounds. Two rounds were played per day with the semi-finals and final played on the Thursday. All matches were over 18 holes, with extra holes played to ensure a result. The winner received the championship cup valued at 50 guineas. In addition the winner received a gold medal, the runner-up a silver one and the two semi-finalists received bronze medals. Lady Margaret Scott beat Issette Pearson in the final by a score of 7&5.", "The 1894 championship was held in May at Littlestone-on-Sea in Kent. May became the regular month for the championship to be held, although sometimes it was held in early June. The event was extended to the Friday, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals played on the Thursday. The finalists were the same as in 1893, with Lady Margaret Scott winning again, but by a closer margin of 3&2. In 1895 the event was played at Royal Portrush. The semi-finals and final were played on the Friday, a format that was retained until the introduction of a 36-hole final in 1913. Margaret Scott won for the third time, beating Emma Lythgoe 5&4 in the final. The 1896 event at Hoylake produced a new winner, Amy Pascoe. In 1897 the championship was held in Scotland for the first time, at Gullane. It produced the first Scottish winner, with the final between two sisters, Edith Orr beating Theodora 4&3. The 1898 event at Great Yarmouth & Caister was won by Lena Thomson, the losing finalist in 1896. She beat Elinor Nevile 6&5 in the final.", "|1895 || Royal Portrush ||  Margaret Scott ||align=\"center\"|5 & 4 ||  Emma Lythgoe ||  Alice Richardson,  Grace Willock || ", "|1894 || Littlestone ||  Margaret Scott ||align=\"center\"|3 & 2 ||  Issette Pearson ||  Maud Starkie Bence,  May Mugliston || ", "|1893 || Lytham & St Annes ||  Margaret Scott ||align=\"center\"|7 & 5 ||  Issette Pearson ||  Florence Carr,  Effie Terry || ", "* 3 wins: Margaret Scott, May Hezlet, Enid Wilson, Jessie Valentine, Brigitte Varangot"]}, {"page": "List of female golfers", "response": ["| Margaret Scott||1874\u20131938"]}, {"page": "Margaret Scott", "response": ["Margaret Scott or Maggie Scott may refer to:", "*Margaret Scott (Salem witch trials) (c. 1615\u20131692), convicted at the Salem witch trials and hanged", "*Margaret Scott (golfer) (1874\u20131938), British golfer", "*Margaret Scott (suffragette) or Margot Schenke (1888\u20131973), UK suffragette", "*Margaret Scott (dancer) (1922\u20132019), South African-born Australian dancer", "*Margaret Scott (New Zealand author) (1928\u20132014), New Zealand writer, editor and librarian", "*Marilyn Waltz or Margaret Scott (1931\u20132006), American actress and model", "*Margaret Scott (Australian author) (1934\u20132005), Australian author, poet and television personality", "*USS Margaret Scott, a U.S. Navy Stone Fleet ship"]}, {"page": "Lady Margaret Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Scott (golfer)"]}, {"page": "Lake Como Golf Club", "response": ["The Lake Como Golf Club was an Italian golf course, constructed in 1905 in Dervio by Margaret Scott and Frederick Gustavus Hamilton-Russell."]}]}}
