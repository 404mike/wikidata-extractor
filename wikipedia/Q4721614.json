Most modern homes will have several of these devices in their homes in all types of electronic equipment.He served as a Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Surrey, where he headed the Optoelectronic Materials and Devices Research Group. He is now retired and holds the position of emeritus professor. He was awarded the Duddell Medal and Prize in 1995, and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996. In 2014 he was awarded the Rank Prize in Optoelectronics for his pioneering work on strained-layer laser structures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Surrey", "response": ["Academics to work at the university include Alf Adams, pioneer of the strained quantum-well laser; Jim Al-Khalili, the nuclear physicist, author and broadcaster; Aleks Krotoski, the technology journalist and broadcaster; Sir Martin Sweeting, founder of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd; Nigel Gilbert, the sociologist pioneer in the use of agent-based models in the social sciences;, Joao Santos Silva, who has made fundamental contributions to the gravity model of trade, and Martyn Barrett, who led the development of the Council of Europe's Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture and is a lead expert for the Council of Europe's Education Policy Advisers Network."]}, {"page": "Eli Yablonovitch", "response": ["* Alf Adams.

The laser is distinctive for producing a more concentrated beam than other quantum well lasers, making it considerably more efficient. The lasers are notable for usage in CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray drives as well as applications in supermarket barcode readers and telephone optical transmission."]}, {"page": "Walter Eric Spear", "response": ["One of his PhD students at Leicester was Alf Adams, the British physicist who invented the strained-layer quantum-well laser.
