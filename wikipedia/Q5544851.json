Finances were extremely tight but Frith made some shrewd low-cost signings, including Irish international Reg Ryan, Alan Daley, and Accrington's George Stewart. When the club's goalkeeper, Jim Sanders, broke his leg in September Frith persuaded 44-year-old Alf Wood, who played his first game in 1938 and had returned to the club as a trainer, to take his place. Wood played ten games, of which the team lost only one, before being replaced with the signing of Arthur Lightening. Frith's tactics paid off, and City were promoted in second place, behind Port Vale. Coventry's good form continued in the 1959\u201360 season, and they were a contender for a second-successive promotion until Easter. But a run of three defeats in the final matches meant that they missed out. Once more in a perilous financial situation, Coventry started 1960\u201361 poorly with only four wins in the first sixteen games. They rallied in the middle part of the season, but another poor run consigned them to a poor finish. The most significant aspect of the season was that Walter Brandish was replaced by Derrick Robins as club chairman; it was under Robins' chairmanship that the club's fortunes were transformed."]}, {"page": "George Stewart (footballer born 1927)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Stewart (footballer, born 1927)"]}]}}
