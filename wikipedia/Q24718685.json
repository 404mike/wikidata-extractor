The son of an engineer, after university he specialised in lubrication, working briefly for Fleming's Oil Company before founding his own company, Alexander Duckham & Co, in Millwall in 1899.\nBy the outbreak of World War I, he was an authority on technological problems relating to lubrication, and the company went public in about 1920, relocating from Millwall to Hammersmith. By the time he died in 1945, Duckhams had assumed a dominant position for the supply of lubricants and corrosion inhibitors to the motor industry in Britain and other markets. A new manufacturing plant was opened in Staffordshire in 1968, and soon thereafter the company was taken over by BP.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Louis Bl\u00e9riot", "response": ["The Bl\u00e9riot Memorial, the outline of the aircraft laid out in granite setts in the turf (funded by oil manufacturer Alexander Duckham), marks his landing spot above the cliffs near Dover Castle. ."]}, {"page": "Alfred Yarrow", "response": ["He lived in Greenwich, London for some years, occupying Woodlands House in Mycenae Road, Westcombe Park for some years from 1896.

He donated the house (and Rooks Hill House in Sevenoaks) to the RAF Benevolent Fund in 1920 to be used as a school for the children of RAF personnel killed in service. Surprisingly, perhaps, the RAF school provided the choir for the Royal Naval College chapel, on the further side of Greenwich park. The boys were initially taught by Captain Slimming, in the only school room, before moving up to the nearby The John Roan School. The Wakefield Wing was added in 1938, but at the outbreak of war in 1939 the boys were evacuated to Rye and Bexhill. Once it was realised that any German invasion would most probably occur in that area, the school moved again to Wales. The building became Grade I listed property in October 1951. The choral conductor James William Webb-Jones was Headmaster of the school from 1951 to 1955. The choral musician Peter Stanley Lyons, who was simultaneously Director of Music at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, was Director of Music at Vanbrugh Castle School from 1950 to 1954. The school moved to Duke of Kent School in Ewhurst, Surrey in 1976. The house was then acquired by a group of four people for \u00a3100,000 and converted to four private flats.Property: The living quarters which earned this castle's keep: Sir John Vanbrugh's last home was built in the early 18th century on the lines of the Bastille prison, The Independent, 25 July 1992"]}, {"page": "Duckham", "response": ["*Alexander Duckham (1877\u20131945), English chemist and businessman"]}, {"page": "Duckham, Alexander", "response": ["#redirectAlexander Duckham"]}, {"page": "Duckham's oils", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Duckham#Duckhams"]}, {"page": "Duckhams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Duckham"]}]}}
