Sandwiched between the defence's on 8 May 2005 also came an 8-round victory over former British and European champion Noel Wilders. Pickering put his belts on the line, when on 28 October 2005, he challenged new British champion Michael Hunter for the belt that he never lost in the ring. In an exciting contest Pickering eventually went home empty handed dropping a majority decision for his fourth career defeat in a fight which took place in Hunter's backyard, the Borough Hall in Hartlepool. Pickering rebounded from the defeat with a victory over French journeyman Frederic Bonifai and with Hunter choosing to challenge for the IBF World title he found himself challenging for the now vacant title. The fight on 11 November 2006 took place in Dublin and saw Ireland's Bernard Dunne lift the belt with a unanimous victory over 12 rounds.Superb Dunne outclasses Pickering BBC Sport, 12 November 2006.
