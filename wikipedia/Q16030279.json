He played as a goalkeeper, but initially was a defender, featuring in the 1877 Scottish Cup Final for Rangers in that role but taking up the specialist position by the time the club appeared in the showpiece fixture again two years later. Gillespie was on the losing side in both those finals, and also in the English FA Cup Finals of 1884 and 1885 with Queen's Park, but he did win the Scottish Cup with the Spiders in 1886 and 1890.", "link_mentions": {}}}
