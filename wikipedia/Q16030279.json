He played as a goalkeeper, but initially was a defender, featuring in the 1877 Scottish Cup Final for Rangers in that role but taking up the specialist position by the time the club appeared in the showpiece fixture again two years later. Gillespie was on the losing side in both those finals, and also in the English FA Cup Finals of 1884 and 1885 with Queen's Park, but he did win the Scottish Cup with the Spiders in 1886 and 1890. He also played once for the English amateur side Corinthian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1850s in association football", "response": ["* 22 June \u2013 George Gillespie (d. 1900), Scotland international goalkeeper in seven matches (1880\u20131891)."]}, {"page": "1884 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||GK ||George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "1885 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || George Gillespie ||"]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. international footballers", "response": ["| George Gillespie ||align=\"center\" | 27 March 1880|| align=\"center\"| 22 March 1890  ||align=\"center\"|5"]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Forrest (footballer)", "response": ["In the cup final, played at the Kennington Oval on 29 March, Rovers lined up against a Queen's Park side, most of whom were Scottish internationals.Ironically, Scotland faced Wales in their last match in the 1884 British Home Championship on the day of the cup final and were forced to field a reserve eleven. After half an hour of play in the final, Forrest (who was playing at right-half) \"delivered an excellent pass\" to Jimmy Brown who rounded two defenders prior to crossing the ball into the Queen's Park goalmouth. The goalkeeper, George Gillespie, was unable to clear the ball which fell to Joe Sowerbutts who had only to apply the gentlest touch to help the ball between the posts. Shortly after, William Anderson thought he had scored for the Scots but the goal was disallowed for offside by referee Francis Marindin. Forrest then scored Blackburn's second goal \u2013 after the ball was partially cleared by Gillespie it fell to Joe Lofthouse who returned it into the goalmouth where Forrest was waiting to put the ball in the net. Forrest was almost certainly offside but, in the absence of an appeal by the Scots, Mandarin allowed the goal to stand. By half-time, Queen's Park had pulled a goal back through Christie. In the second half, both sides had goals disallowed for offside, but there was no further score, and Blackburn Rovers took the cup for the first time."]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|GK ||||George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "1877 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FB ||  George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "George Gillespie (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Gillespie (1613\u20131648) was a Scottish theologian.", "George Gillespie may also refer to:", "*George Gillespie (footballer) (1859\u20131900), Scottish footballer (Rangers FC, Queen's Park FC and Scotland)"]}, {"page": "1886 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|GK||||George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "1879 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|GK |||| George Gillespie"]}, {"page": "Original Glasgow derby", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| George Gillespie"]}]}}
