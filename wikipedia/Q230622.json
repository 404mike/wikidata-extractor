They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.  Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and many more.Pareles, Jon, Estelle Stewart Axton, 85, A Founder of Stax Records (New York Times) 2004.

As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market. Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.P.
