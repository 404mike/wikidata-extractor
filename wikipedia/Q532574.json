He commanded II Corps at the Battle of Mons, the first major action fought by the BEF, and the Battle of Le Cateau, where he fought a vigorous and successful defensive action contrary to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief Sir John French, with whom he had had a personality clash dating back some years. In the spring of 1915 he commanded the Second Army at the Second Battle of Ypres. He was relieved of command by French for requesting permission to retreat from the Ypres Salient to a more defensible position.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1930", "response": ["* August 12 \u2013 Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, English general (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "1858", "response": ["* May 26 \u2013 Horace Smith-Dorrien, British general (d. 1930)"]}, {"page": "History of Eswatini", "response": ["In December 1900 \u2013 January 1901, there were reports that retreating Boers were attempting to flee through Swaziland.

Most of the captured Boers were sent to the concentration camp of Volksrust. On 11 February, another column under Edmund Allenby was positioned at the southern border of Swaziland.

Haig's reactions to his corps' skirmish with German forces at Landrecies (during which Haig led his staff into the street, revolvers drawn, promising to \"sell our lives dearly\") caused him to send an exaggerated report to French, which caused French to panic. The following day 26 August, Horace Smith-Dorrien's II Corps engaged the enemy in the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig. This battle slowed the German army's advance. However, a critical biographer writes that too much has been made of the \"moment of panic\" at Landrecies, and that the  retreat, over a period of 13 days, is a tribute to the \"steady and competent leadership\" of Haig and Smith-Dorrien.Groot 1988, p. 157."]}, {"page": "Jan Smuts", "response": ["Smuts' chief Intelligence officer, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, wrote very critically of his conduct of the campaign.

In particular, Meinertzhagen thought that frontal attacks would have been decisive, and less costly than the flanking movements preferred by Smuts, which took longer, so that thousands of Imperial troops died of disease in the field. He wrote: \"Smuts has cost Britain many hundreds of lives and many millions of pounds by his caution...

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the strategic lapses and failings in grand tactics on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat. The initial view, reported by Horace Smith-Dorrien, was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.
