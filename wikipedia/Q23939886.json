Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was \"handling the pressure a lot better.\" Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: \"We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole\u00a0... they're not aggressive or tough enough.\"  Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race.  Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992) was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller.  Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier, but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of \"professionals\" to the race.  Of his selection, he noted: \"You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit.\"  Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: \"I nearly didn't make it. I couldn't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place.\"", "Oxford were strong pre-race favourites, having won 16 of the last 17 races.  Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.  Two minutes after the start, and in cold, overcast conditions, Cambridge's cox Martin Haycock was level with Oxford's Jo Michels who occupied the number two seat in the Dark Blue boat.  Responding to a call to push on, Cambridge were clear upon reaching the Mile Post in record time, and moved in front of Oxford.  Further record times were set as the Light Blues passed under Hammersmith Bridge and by Chiswick Steps before they passed the finishing post  lengths clear in 17 minutes.  It was Cambridge's first victory since the 1986 race and just their second victory in eighteen years.  The winning time was the fourth fastest in the history of the event, surpassed only by Oxford in the 1991, 1984 and 1976 races, and was Cambridge's fastest time ever.  Cambridge's victory prevented the overall score from being levelled for the first time since 1929."]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1993 Summer Universiade", "response": ["| ClarryRogersWildCracknellBehrensRichard PhelpsCassidyMatthew ParishMartin Haycock"]}, {"page": "Haycock, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Haycock"]}]}}
