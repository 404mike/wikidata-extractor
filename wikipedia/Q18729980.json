She was a member of John Ruskin's circle and was one of a number of women artists working and exhibiting during the Victorian age. Her best known work is The Seamstress (1854), a piece inspired by Thomas Hood\u2019s poem The Song of the Shirt. Starting her career with oil painting, Blunden moved to painting landscapes in watercolours and these make up a large proportion of her remaining works. Her work was regularly showcased at the Royal Academy and by the Society of British Artists from 1854 to 1867, as well as by the Birmingham Society of Artists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Anna Blunden (1829\u20131915)"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Anna Blunden (1829\u20131915) \u2013 English painter "]}, {"page": "Heatherley School of Fine Art", "response": ["* Anna Blunden"]}, {"page": "Blunden", "response": ["*Anna Blunden (1829\u20131915), English pre-Raphaelite artist"]}, {"page": "English Female Artists", "response": ["Barbara Bodichon, Eleanor Brown, Marian Emma Chase, Marian Croft, Susan Elizabeth Gay, Mary Gow, Alice Elfrida Manly, Madeline Marrable, Anna Blunden Martino, Clara Montalba, Emma Sophia Oliver, Elizabeth Phillips, Louise, Rose, and Margaret Rayner, Frances Redgrave, Harriette Anne Seymour, Norah and Ellen Vernon, Hilda Annetta Walker, Sophie S.
