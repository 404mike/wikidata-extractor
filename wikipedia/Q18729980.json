She was a member of John Ruskin's circle and was one of a number of women artists working and exhibiting during the Victorian age. Her best known work is The Seamstress (1854), a piece inspired by Thomas Hood\u2019s poem The Song of the Shirt. Starting her career with oil painting, Blunden moved to painting landscapes in watercolours and these make up a large proportion of her remaining works. Her work was regularly showcased at the Royal Academy and by the Society of British Artists from 1854 to 1867, as well as by the Birmingham Society of Artists.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
