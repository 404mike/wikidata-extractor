In January 2011, he signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract.

Amid much contradictory information and mutual recrimination, Devlin was used increasingly as a substitute, and made his last league appearance on 13 December. Francis dropped him to the reserves after his refusal to agree a new contract and what the Birmingham Post dubbed \"a catalogue of tantrum-throwing\", preferring the pacy Nicky Forster to partner Furlong. Soon afterwards, Devlin gave up his Sports Argus newspaper column to team-mate Ian Bennett, who wrote that \"because of [Devlin's] current situation at the club it became increasingly difficult [for him] to write about the goings on\". Out of contract at the end of the season, his valuation dropped systematically as the season wore on, and he was finally sold to divisional rivals Sheffield United in March 1998 for an initial \u00a3200,000, an additional \u00a350,000 contingent on promotion, and a 15% sell-on clause. Devlin said he was sad to leave, and felt that had the manager rated him, he \"wouldn't have been forced out and made to train with the reserves and kids for the last few months. Money wasn't the issue\"; Francis suggested that Sheffield United were \"one of the few clubs who have the capacity to pay out the sort of salary that attracts Paul.\""]}, {"page": "Lingfield F.C.", "response": ["*Nicky Forster"]}, {"page": "Karleigh Osborne", "response": ["Talks over a new three-year contract began in January 2011, which went unresolved after the sacking of manager Andy Scott and the appointment of interim manager Nicky Forster a matter of weeks later.
