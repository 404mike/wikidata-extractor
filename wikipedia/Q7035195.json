Verma said in an interview that on initially hearing Singh's \"Blue Eyes\" it \"hooked\" her, but that when she \"paid attention to the lyrics\" she realized they were \"very problematic\". Femina said that Verma uses phrases in Singh's works to express her disgust, and appreciates that the message Verma wishes to convey that every woman is intrinsically good the way she is. The target is not only Singh but also eve teasers, who were the template for works such as Singh's. Although there have been other protests against Singh's work, including petitions and an open letter written by Annie Zaidi in The Sunday Guardian, Verma's rap number uses the same artistic format as Singh and incorporates some of his own lyrics. Verma's work has been considered as an example of Indian women confronting adversities. Verma's work has been cited as an example of a spoken word performance being used as a revolutionary tool, and as parodying Singh while attacking the sexism in Singh's rap. Subsequently the video of another work of hers received over 180,000 hits on YouTube and was the subject of media attention, in which she was described as someone who had confronted Singh, and \"slamming\" and \"knocking the wind out of\" him. She was featured on The Arts Hour for the BBC World Service presented by Nikki Bedi, with her rap number \"Reclaim the night\"."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Smooth Radio", "response": ["** August \u2013 Nikki Bedi joins."]}, {"page": "Timeline of BBC Radio London", "response": ["**23 April - Nikki Bedi joins.", "**2 January \u2013 Penny Smith replaces Gaby Roslin as co-presenter of the breakfast show.
