The first single for Silvertone, \"Elephant Stone\", made little impact, and in early 1989 the band's performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences.Robb, p. 195 \"Made of Stone\" received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ Richard Skinner on his late night Radio One show, but peaked at number ninety on the UK Singles Chart. The Stone Roses was released in April  / May 1989, initially to mostly positive reviews, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 32 in mid-May, the highest position it would reach that year.Robb, p. 207 This was followed with the single \"She Bangs the Drums\", which gave them a top forty UK hit, and a number one on the UK Independent Chart, and by that point they were receiving much greater press attention and were selling out shows across the country.Robb, p. 218Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980\u20131989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 218 The band gained widespread notoriety when, one minute into a live 1989 TV performance on the BBC's The Late Show, the power failed, prompting Ian Brown to repeatedly squeal \"Amateurs!\" at Tracey MacLeod. Later in 1989 the band released a double A-side single, \"Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For\", which reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in November.Roberts, David, ed. (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums (19th ed.). HiT Entertainment. p. 534. . Originally intended as a B-side, \"Fools Gold\" quickly became the Roses' most famous song and a performance of it on Top of the Pops cemented their national fame. It gave them their first top ten hit and the album rose to number nineteen in the chart early the following year."]}, {"page": "Band Aid (band)", "response": ["Geldof was so moved by the plight of starving children in Ethiopia, that he decided to try to raise money using his contacts in pop music. Geldof enlisted the help of Midge Ure, from the group Ultravox, to produce a charity record. Ure took Geldof's lyrics, and created the melody and backing track for the record. Geldof called many of the most popular British and Irish performers of the time, persuading them to give their time free. His one criterion for selection was how famous they were, to maximise sales of the record. He then kept an appointment to appear on a show on BBC Radio 1, with Richard Skinner, but instead of promoting the new Boomtown Rats material as planned, he announced the plan for Band Aid."]}, {"page": "Live Aid", "response": ["Broadcaster Richard Skinner opened the Live Aid concert with the words:", "The concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the BBC, whose broadcast was presented by Richard Skinner, Andy Kershaw, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth, Andy Batten-Foster, Steve Blacknell, Paul Gambaccini, Janice Long and Mike Smith and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts. The BBC's television sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before NICAM was introduced, but the BBC Radio 1 feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers omitted the reunion of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young from their broadcast. The BBC, however, did supply a 'clean feed' to various television channels in Europe.", "* Richard Skinner\u2014opened the show and introduced Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales"]}, {"page": "Dexys Midnight Runners", "response": ["In April, Dexys prevailed to win their release from EMI, although without the financial support of a label, they were unable to mount the spring tour that had planned and had to settle for playing only five dates, including one recorded by BBC Radio 1.  In June they signed to Mercury Records, where Dexys remained until their 1987 breakup.  Dexys' first single for Mercury, \"Show Me\", produced by Tony Visconti. was released in July 1981 and reached No.\u00a016 in the UK.  The label switch was followed by a session for Richard Skinner's BBC Radio 1 show in which the band previewed tracks that would be reworked later on Too-Rye-Ay. Wynne was sacked by the group at this point, to be replaced by Mick Gallick (whom Rowland gave the stage name \"Giorgio Kilkenny\") on bass.  Music journalist Paolo Hewitt commented about this version of Dexys: \"Dexys wouldn't make a record unless they thought it was great.

In 1983, the programme was moved to a live mid-evening slot. The title was abridged to Whistle Test and the title credits and music were changed. Andy Kershaw joined the series as a presenter in 1984. The same four presenters co-presented the BBC's television coverage of Live Aid in 1985."]}, {"page": "Alternative rock", "response": ["In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.Charlton, p. 349."]}, {"page": "Judie Tzuke", "response": ["Promotion for the album had begun in March when a three-track promo had been issued widely to independent record stores, and Tzuke made two live performances at London's Shaw Theatre in April.

It just sounds like the band's in the front room with you.\" In a radio interview with Richard Skinner at the time of the album's release, Hollis commented that \"I think silence is an extremely important thing. It isn't something that should be abused. And that's my biggest worry because of the whole way that communications have developed, that there is a tendency just to allow this background noise all the time rather than thinking about what is important. The silence is above everything, and I would rather hear one note than I would two, and I would rather hear silence than I would one note,\" and according to Wyndham Wallace, \"this helps explain the fifteen seconds of amplifier hiss that open the record's first track, 'Myrrhman', the huge amounts of space left in final track 'Runeii', and the overall sonic concept perfected by Friese-Greene and Brown, who declares third track 'After The Flood' to be \"probably the best engineering for me in the past forty years.\" Drums were miked far from the kit, sounds were allowed to echo through the studio space, mistakes were an integral part of the performance, and the album's dynamics are entirely genuine, the live feel of a jazz record.\""]}, {"page": "Magic (UK radio station)", "response": ["In an attempt to cut costs, Magic began networking its mid-morning show, hosted by Richard Skinner, and automated overnight output with the eight other Magic stations in the North of England in January 2002.
