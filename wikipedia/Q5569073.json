He signed in 1996 for Derbyshire, for whom he played at First-class level.\nAfter appearing in a debut match which more-or-less put Derbyshire out of the running for the 1996 County Championship title, despite making a half-century himself.  He had the nickname, 'Mr Charisma'.\nHe continued to perform for Derbyshire well into 1998, primarily as a batsman, but as 1999 came, and the whole team suffered a dip in form, Roberts was out of the side. Team-mate Ian Blackwell's bowling skill had developed, and Roberts was surplus to requirements. He was not re-signed by any team until 2001, when he appeared in the Minor Counties Championship for Herefordshire. He was a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler\nGlen recently became a professional umpire in his hometown region. Glen has umpired at some of the top venues around the country.", "link_mentions": []}}
