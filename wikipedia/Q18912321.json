Basil Lubbock's The Opium Clippers, cited in the original entry, is quite clear (p.347) that the Double Island in question was that at what was then called Swatow (today Shantou). The island is one of two that lie in the entrance to the river at Shantou and is the inner one, then called Masu. Today it is called Mayu (). For corroboration see Mayers & Dennys,William Frederick Mayers and Nicholas Belfield Dennys, The Treaty Ports of China and Japan (Hong Kong: Shortrede, 1867), p.236  for the identity of Double Island. For the typhoon and the damage to the vessels, The Courier (Hobart, Tasmania), 22 December 1858, p.3 for a report of Mr Midwood, of the Commissariat service, resident on Double Island during the typhoon."]}, {"page": "William Ruxton Davison", "response": ["Davison came from a family originating in northern England.
