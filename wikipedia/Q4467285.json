Two goals in each half for Ipswich, including a brace for Crawford ensured a 4\u20130 win with the East Anglian Daily Times suggesting that United had lost their undefeated run \"without a fight\".  Six days later, Ipswich faced Sheffield Wednesday, and were behind in seven minutes to a Colin Dobson goal.  Crawford equalised and with two minutes remaining passed to Stephenson who scored to secure Ipswich's eleventh consecutive home league victory.  On 14 March, Ipswich took on Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in front of a crowd of more than 50,000, and won 3\u20131 to become the first side to beat Tottenham home and away for three seasons.  Crawford put Ipswich ahead but Jimmy Greaves soon equalised for Tottenham.  Phillips made it 2\u20131 just before half-time and Crawford made it 3\u20131 for the win which Frank Taylor writing in the Daily Herald described as \"the finest match [he had] seen all season.\"  Three days later Ipswich hosted Blackpool at Portman Road.  Crawford beat five defenders before passing to Moran who scored to make it 1\u20130 to the home side.  Although it took until the 89th minute for Blackpool to equalise, and take a point from the match, Ipswich chairman John Cobbold admitted that the visitors were \"unlucky not to take two points.\"  "]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2002", "response": ["*Frank Taylor, 81.
