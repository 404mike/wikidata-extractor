Barry McIntosh, a football agent, was called in to scout players for an upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifier against Cuba and ultimately he secured eight players i.e. Wayne Allison (Tranmere Rovers), Ged Brannan (Motherwell), David Barnett (Lincoln City), Martin O'Connor (Birmingham City), Dwayne Plummer (Bristol City), Barry Hayles (Fulham), Neville Roach (Southend United) and Neil Sharpe (Boreham Wood). With the exception of Allison the players all appeared in a 5\u20130 friendly defeat against D.C. United but before they could appear in any official internationals FIFA stepped in and barred the players from representing the Cayman Islands due to their failure to satisfy the existing rules for national team eligibility.Footballers whose loved ones have told them who to play for, The Guardian, 5 March 2008 Of the eight players only Hayles went on to play international football, appearing for Jamaica ten times."]}, {"page": "2007 Conference National play-off Final", "response": ["|MF ||12||Ged Brannan || || "]}, {"page": "1994 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["Leicester City's opponents in their semi-final were Tranmere Rovers, with the first leg being hosted at Prenton Park, Tranmere, on 15 May 1994.
