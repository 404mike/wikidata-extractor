Losing Katherine and Helen is a big blow to the show, so Phil wants to beef things up a bit with the return of a couple of big names.\" O'Brien revealed in January 2012 that bosses had not approached her about a return to the soap. O'Brien has since revealed that she is worried that another actress might take over the role of Sarah.
