After graduating from the London School of Economics, his career included two years as head of visitor services at Salisbury Cathedral and four years working in Liverpool. In his later years he supported community and environmental projects in Southwark, South London. For a time he managed school building projects for Southwark Council, then became manager of Surrey Docks Farm.For many years he was the voluntary coordinator of Southwark Cyclists, whose secretary described him as \"visionary and energetic over very many years in campaigning to improve safety and security for cyclists\". Mason helped to make it one of the most active of the London Cycling Campaign's borough groups, as well as reviving the neighbouring Greenwich Cyclists. He ran maintenance classes and organized rides, including mass rides on Christmas Day, and organised return transport from the Dunwich Dynamo, an annual midsummer ride from London to Suffolk. He was cited by the press on cycling-related subjects such as safety and parking, and won the London Cycling Personality of the Year award in 2006.Mason died while swimming off the coast near Rodiles in northern Spain during a cycling holiday in June 2011 with his partner Cheryl. He had a son and daughter from his marriage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dunwich Dynamo", "response": ["The event was started in 1993 when Patrick Field, of the London School of Cycling, converted an informal ride into an organised event. It was sponsored by Mosquito Bikes of Essex Road, Islington, with some mechanical support and \"controls\" where riders had to check in to stamp an Audax-style \u201cBrevet card\u201d. During this period the ride started from the Eastway cycle circuit rather than London Fields as at present. After about 4 years the ride, which had become very popular, continued on an unsupported 'turn up and go' basis. The controls and support ended, and the organisation of transport back from Dunwich at the end of the ride was arranged by Southwark Cyclists. For many years this was managed by Barry Mason."]}, {"page": "Surrey Docks Farm", "response": ["For the last few years of his life until June 2011, the farm was managed by local campaigner Barry Mason."]}, {"page": "Barry Mason (disambiguation)", "response": ["Barry Mason (1935\u20132021) was an English songwriter.", "Barry Mason may also refer to:", "*Barry Mason (sculptor) (born 1952), British sculptor", "*Barry Mason (cyclist) (1950\u20132011), English cycling activist", "*Don Barry Mason (1950\u20132006), founder of the Psychedelic Shamanistic Institute", "*Barry Mason (musician) (1947\u20132020), English guitarist and lutenist, director of the Early Music Centre.", "* J.
