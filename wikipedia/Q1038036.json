The partnership lasted from 1991 until 2003 during which time they entered into 103 world rallies, achieving 277 stage wins and 34 podium finishes.  The pair were runners-up in the 1999 World Rally Championship and the 2000 World Rally Championship. Since retiring from competition Reid has held positions with both Motorsport UK and FIA, and is currently President of the FIA Closed Road Commission and a member of both the FIA Safety Commission and the FIA International Sporting Code Review Commission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Burns", "response": ["Richard Alexander Burns (17 January 1971 \u2013 25 November 2005) was an English rally driver who won the 2001 World Rally Championship, having previously finished runner-up in the series in 1999 and 2000. He also helped Mitsubishi to the world manufacturers' title in 1998, and Peugeot in 2002. His co-driver in his whole career was Robert Reid. He is the only Englishman to have won the World Rally Championship as a driver.", "In 1990 he joined the Peugeot Challenge after David Williams bought Burns a Peugeot 205 GTI. Upon winning that series, Richard's prize was a chance to drive a World Rally Championship event in Great Britain that same year. Then in 1991 Burns met Robert Reid, the man who was to become his co-driver for the rest of his career, finishing 16th in their first WRC rally together. For 1992 Williams purchased a Group N Subaru Legacy for Burns; with support from Prodrive, they won the National Championship. This year also saw Burns help Colin McRae with his gravel notesBurns, R: Driving Ambition, page 72. Hodder and Stoughton, 2002. as Prodrive viewed Richard as a promising talent for the future. Burns won that year's Severn Valley Rally outright despite being in a slower car.", "There, all three of Burns' rivals were to have suffered retirement from the event by the end of the second leg proceedings on Saturday. On Sunday, 25 November 2001, therefore, Burns' third-place finish behind Peugeot duo Gronholm and Harri Rovanpera enabled him to become the first Englishman to win the World Rally Championship, with 44 points, he was world champion with the lowest points total since the Formula 1-styled point system was introduced in 1997. When Burns passed the finishing line at the final stage of the final rally in 2001, he uttered words thought to be paying tribute to his codriver Robert Reid: \"You're the best in the world\". To commemorate the title success, Subaru produced a special edition of the Subaru Impreza in the UK called the RB5. A messy legal battle ensued for the Englishman's services for the following 2002 season, from which fresh suitors, 2000 and 2001 manufacturers' champions Peugeot emerged victorious.", "In the 2003 season he was still winless, although seven podiums means he led the championship at most of the season. The gloomy prospect of a continued winning drought with the French team left Burns poised to rejoin Subaru, having signed for them for the second time beginning with the 2004 season, the ploy being to couple him with the eventual 2003 title winner, Norway's Petter Solberg. In November 2003, however, with the Englishman heading to the season-ending Wales Rally GB still with a chance of winning the title, Burns suffered a blackout while driving with Ford driver Markko M\u00e4rtin to the rally. He was withdrawn from the event, and thus the title fight, and was later diagnosed with an astrocytoma, a type of malignant brain tumour. Treatment during 2004 was followed by surgery in April 2005 that was described as \"very successful\". But the diagnosis, that this type of brain tumor was malignant, was only soon realised. In August 2005 a fan day was made in which Burns' supporters were invited to see his private car collection, but he was unable to drive so his co-driver Robert Reid took the seat on his private cars.", "| rowspan=10 |Robert Reid"]}, {"page": "Rally Sweden", "response": ["|  Richard Burns Robert Reid ||  Marlboro Peugeot Total Peugeot 206 WRC"]}, {"page": "Colin McRae", "response": ["In August 2007, McRae said he was still hoping to find a seat for the 2008 WRC season, but said that \"if it doesn't happen next year, then I won't (return) because you can only be out of something at that level for so long.\" In 2007, talking to Autosport podcast, David Richards confirmed that he and McRae had talked about McRae's comeback to Subaru for season 2008.
