He served as the chairman of London Regional Transport from 1999 to 2003.Bates was born in Portsmouth, attended Portsmouth Grammar School, and served in the Royal Air Force from 1956 to 1958. In 1976 he joined General Electric Company, rising up to become the deputy managing director, a position he remained in for twelve years. He led a group of three businessmen in advising the government on the structure of the planned public-private partnership for the London Underground, and replaced Peter Ford as the chairman of London Regional Transport, who had been against the PPP arrangement. He was replaced by Bob Kiley in 2001 who was appointed by Tony Blair to oversee the implementation of the PPP, however following Kiley's firing amid repeated clashes with the Transport Secretary Stephen Byers regarding the PPP arrangement, he was reappointed as chairman, a position he served in until 2003.Under his second stint as chairman, he passed the \u00a316 billion PPP proposal, with London Underground remaining a public company running the trains while private companies, Metronet and Tube Lines, were responsible for upgrading the railway. He was awarded a knighthood in 1998. He resigned as Chairman of London Regional Transport on 15 July 2003, as the organisation was succeeded by Transport for London. Metronet later collapsed in 2008, costing the UK Government \u00a32 billion, and Tube Lines was bought out in 2010. The National Audit Office found that \"there was limited assurance that the price of the three Tube PPPs was reasonable\", and following the collapse of Metronet the arrangement was heavily criticised in the press. In 2010, the Transport Select Committee found that the PPP was \"flawed\" and failed to provide \"value for money\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Private finance initiative", "response": ["To better promote PFI, the Labour government appointed Malcolm Bates to chair the efforts to review the policy with a number of Arthur Andersen staffers. They recommended the creation of a Treasury Task Force (TTF) to train public servants into PFI practice and to coordinate the implementation of PFI. In 1998, the TTF was renamed to \"Partnership UK\" (PUK) and sold 51% of its share to the private sector. PUK was then chaired by Sir Derek Higgs, director of Prudential Insurance and chairman of British Land plc. These changes meant that the government transferred the responsibility of managing PFI to a corporation closely related with the owners, financiers, consultants, and subcontractors that stood to benefit from this policy. This created a strong appearance of conflict of interest."]}, {"page": "Bob Kiley", "response": ["In October 2000, Kiley was head-hunted to become the first Commissioner of Transport for London (TfL), London's new integrated transport body, reporting to the Mayor of London directly. Following his appointment, Kiley was criticised by the press due to his \u00a34m four-year contract, the use of a \u00a32m grace and favour property in Belgravia, and his expatriate status. He was regarded by the press as \"a strange bedfellow\" for Ken Livingstone, the socialist elected in 2000 as London's first mayor. However, Livingstone considered Kiley \"the best candidate\", with very similar views on transportation to himself. In January 2001 Kiley became Chairman of London Regional Transport (the public body appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport to run London's Underground network of trains), replacing Sir Malcolm Bates.", "Livingstone's and Kiley's were opposed to the government's plans for public-private partnerships (PPP) to run London Underground. Kiley was sacked as chairman of London Regional Transport in July 2001 amid repeated clashes with his boss, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and was replaced by Malcolm Bates who returned to lead the organisation. Remaining as Commissioner of Transport for London, he and Livingstone took the government to court in trying to prevent PPP. They failed, and in January 2003 two separate private companies - Metronet and Tube Lines - took control of maintaining various tube lines. In July 2003 powers for running the rest of the Tube network, including manning and maintaining the stations, was transferred to TfL and London Regional Transport became defunct. Kiley welcomed the opportunity to take greater control over the running of the Tube, but warned that he felt he would be hampered by PPP: \"I maintain that the Government\u2019s Public Private Partnership (PPP) is not the right way to manage the maintenance and renewal of the Tube. As they stand, the PPP contracts do not satisfactorily address the improvements to the Underground that TfL and the public demand. Nevertheless, we will do everything within our power to hold the infrastructure companies to account on those Tube improvements they have promised to deliver.\" Subsequently, the PPPs collapsed due to financial difficulties in the late 2000s."]}, {"page": "London Regional Transport", "response": ["* Sir Malcolm Bates, 1999\u20132001", "* Sir Malcolm Bates, 2001\u20132003"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Bates", "response": ["Malcolm Bates may refer to:", "* Malcolm Bates, a character in the soap opera Emmerdale played by Tom Adams ", "* Malcolm Bates (transport administrator), chairman of London Regional Transport from 1999 to 2003"]}, {"page": "List of heads of public transport authorities in London", "response": ["*Sir Malcolm Bates, 1999\u20132001", "*Sir Malcolm Bates, 2001\u20132003"]}, {"page": "List of Old Portmuthians", "response": ["*Sir Malcolm Bates (1934\u20132009), chairman of London Regional Transport from 1999\u20132003"]}, {"page": "Diecast Model World", "response": ["Diecast Model World premiered in 2011.
