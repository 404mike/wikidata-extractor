Over 90 of his books, mainly fantasy, appeared in his lifetime; his original work and compilations have continued to appear. They include several hundred short stories, and many plays, novels, and essays. He gained fame with his early stories and plays and was seen in the 1910s as a great writer of the English-speaking world. He is best known today for a 1924 fantasy novel, The King of Elfland's Daughter, and for The Gods of Peg\u0101na, where he devised a fictional pantheon and laid the grounds for the fantasy genre. Born in London to the second-oldest title (created 1439) in the Irish peerage, he was raised there and in Kent, then lived much of his life at what may be Ireland's longest inhabited house, Dunsany Castle near Tara, though he retired to Shoreham, Kent. He worked with W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, gained an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, was a chess and pistol-shooting champion of Ireland, and travelled and hunted. He also invented an asymmetrical version of chess called Dunsany's chess. He died in Dublin of appendicitis.", "link_mentions": {}}}
