His commentating career began in 2009, while he was co-hosting a chess news podcast called \"The Full English Breakfast\", produced by Macauley Peterson and co-hosted by Stephen J. Gordon. After listening to Trent on the pilot episode, tournament director Malcolm Pein invited him to host-commentate the annual London Chess Classic. This enabled him to gain the experience necessary to co-commentate the FIDE World Championship Candidates Tournament in 2013 with GM Nigel Short."]}]}}
