This meant it was written with a sense of immediacy; having to make an instant effect and each three-minute segment contains a major plot development or sound effect stunt and end on a cliffhanger. DC acknowledged the effort in an issue of Shadow of The Bat by having villains jump past a sign that read Dirk Maggs Radio.
