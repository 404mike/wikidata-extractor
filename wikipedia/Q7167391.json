As described by Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald, by a slow process a well-lit landscape appears (the \"Realms of Bliss\"). And in it, fairies are seen, rising from the ground, or hanging in the air. In The Adventures of Philip by William Makepeace Thackeray from the early 1860s, \"The Realms of Bliss\" is the title of the final chapter, and Thackeray can assume his readers were familiar with the penultimate \"dark scene\" that precedes it, the entrance of the Good Fairy, and the ultimate wedding of Harlequin and Columbine. An 1886 musical version of Alice in Wonderland, classed as an extravaganza, revealed the Realms of Bliss at the start, darkening only at the end when Alice awakes. Peter Pan is embedded in the pantomime tradition, and in its original stage production of 1904, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, ended with a magical transformation scene, returning to Neverland."]}, {"page": "Stoneheart trilogy", "response": ["Dictionary Johnson \u2013 the statue of the first man to write down all English words and their definition, Samuel Johnson.
