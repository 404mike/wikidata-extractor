She climbed in the Alps in the 1920s, joined the Ladies Alpine Club, and met many climbers in the French Groupe de Haute Montagne. In 1928 she married Jean Morin (1897\u20131943) and lived in Paris.  She climbed often with other women and advocated the cord\u00e9e f\u00e9minine, climbing only with women on a rope.  After the death of her husband in World War II, she lived in Tunbridge Wells and climbed in England and Wales and was a member of the female only Pinnacle Club.  In 1941 Morin had made the first ascent of Clogwyn Y Grochan the route, which is 230 feet high and graded very severe 4b, is named Nea. She also led on an ascent of Curving Crack on Clogwyn du'r Arddu (the Black Cliff).In 1959 she was the only woman in the team of six British climbers who attempted to make the first ascent of 6812 meter high Ama Dablam in Nepal.Her autobiography, A Woman's Reach (1968), describes her climbing and the achievement of other women in the mountains.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Nea Morin (1905\u20131986) UK, rock climber and mountain climber"]}, {"page": "Morin", "response": ["* Nea Morin (1905\u20131986), British rock climber"]}, {"page": "Janet Adam Smith", "response": ["She still found time for her own work: almost 20 years after Michael Roberts had edited, at T.S.

All the poems were tried out on an extended family \u2013 her own children, her nephews and nieces, and the children of friends, among whom were the son and daughter of the poet Kathleen Raine. No poem was included, she said, that some child had not loved.
