His previous clubs include Pontypridd RFC, Celtic Warriors, Newport Gwent Dragons and Sale Sharks. Formerly the player/manager of Merthyr RFC, he is currently the head coach at Barry RFC.\nBefore becoming seriously involved in the world of rugby, Jonathan was a talented footballer who was scouted by many professional clubs before switching codes after an invite to play for his old school, Aberdare Boys Comprehensive, against a select XV. This game would include his future teammate, Dale McIntosh.\nSuch was his enthusiasm and drive in the game, he was offered a trial by the then Merthyr Tydfil RFC manager (He was also offered a bet by his uncle that if he \"dump-tackled\" McIntosh he would be financially rewarded and make a talking point in the game few would have anticipated). After two years at Merthyr, Bryant was offered a trial with Pontypridd along with Robert Sidoli, and he scored a try on his debut against Llanelli RFC.\nHe attained his only international cap as a replacement against Romania on 27 August 2003.", "link_mentions": []}}
