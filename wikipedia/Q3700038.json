A criticism of the experiment was that it was flawed because it did not rule out the possibility of fraud. The skeptical investigator Brian Dunning wrote the Scole experiments fail in many ways. The s\u00e9ances were held in the basement of two of the mediums, only total darkness was allowed with no night vision apparatus as it might \"frighten the spirits away\". The box containing the film was not examined and could easily have been accessible to fraud.
