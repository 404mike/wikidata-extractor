She was a columnist for the Daily Express, She magazine, and the News of the World in the 1950s and 1960s. She also appeared on many radio broadcasts, particularly on Woman's Hour and My Word!, and later as a panelist on the television programmes What's My Line? and Juke Box Jury. Spain died in a plane crash near Aintree racecourse while travelling to the 1964 Grand National.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evelyn Waugh", "response": ["Restored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished Officers and Gentlemen. In June 1955 the Daily Express journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for The Spectator,\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in The Spectator, 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370 but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.Amory (ed.), p. 636 Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of Combe Florey.Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386 In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the Express and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.Stannard, pp. 382\u201383", "In the biographic Mad World (2009), Paula Byrne said that the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a \"snobbish misanthrope\" is a caricature; she asks: \"Why would a man, who was so unpleasant, be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends?\"Byrne (postscript), pp. 4\u20135 His generosity to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures;Hastings, pp. 504\u201305 after his libel-court victory over Nancy Spain, he sent her a bottle of champagne.Patey, p. 336 Hastings said that Waugh's outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at \"finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity\".Hastings, pp. 517\u201318 Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself\u2014the elderly buffer, \"crusty colonel\" image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.Hastings, pp. 567\u201368Byrne, pp. 117\u201318"]}, {"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["In 1857, less than a year after the wedding, Beeton began writing for one of her husband's publications, The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. She translated French fiction and wrote the cookery column, though all the recipes were plagiarised from other works or sent in by the magazine's readers. In 1859 the Beetons launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements to The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine; the 24 instalments  were published in one volume as Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management in October 1861, which sold 60,000 copies in the first year. Beeton was working on an abridged version of her book, which was to be titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery, when she died of puerperal fever in February 1865 at the age of 28. She gave birth to four children, two of whom died in infancy, and had several miscarriages. Two of her biographers, Nancy Spain and Kathryn Hughes, posit the theory that Samuel had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the disease on to his wife.", "In May 1866, following a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold the rights to the Book of Household Management\u2009 to Ward, Lock and Tyler (later Ward Lock & Co). The writer Nancy Spain, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons' work, \"surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain\" than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons\u2014especially the death of Isabella\u2014in order to protect their investment by letting readers think she was still alive and creating recipes\u2014what Hughes considers to be \"intentional censorship\". Those later editions continued to make the connection to Beeton in what Beetham considers to be a \"fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler\". Those subsequent volumes bearing Beeton's name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the Book of Household Management\u2009 has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.", "Following the radio broadcast of Meet Mrs. Beeton, a 1934 comedy in which Samuel was portrayed in an unflattering light, and Mrs Beeton, a 1937 documentary, Mayston Beeton worked with H. Montgomery Hyde to produce the biography Mr and Mrs Beeton, although completion and publication were delayed until 1951. In the meantime Nancy Spain published Mrs Beeton and her Husband in 1948, updated and retitled in 1956 to The Beeton Story. In the new edition Spain hinted at, but did not elucidate upon, on the possibility that Samuel contracted syphilis. Several other biographies followed, including from the historian Sarah Freeman, who wrote Isabella and Sam in 1977; Nown's Mrs Beeton: 150 Years of Cookery and Household Management, published on the 150th anniversary of Beeton's birthday, and Hughes's The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton, published in 2006. Beeton was ignored by the Dictionary of National Biography for many years: while Acton was included in the first published volume of 1885, Beeton did not have an entry until 1993."]}, {"page": "My Word!", "response": ["In 1956, Edward J. Mason and Tony Shryane, respectively the writer and producer of the popular radio soap opera The Archers, decided that by way of a change they would devise and produce what Frank Muir called \"a new kind of not-very-academic literary quiz\".Muir, p. 209 The Aeolian Hall in London was booked for the recording of a pilot show, but at the last minute two of the four panellists were unexpectedly unavailable. Shryane sought the help of Muir and his writing partner Denis Norden, scriptwriters of the popular BBC comedy series Take It From Here, who were based in a nearby office. They thought of themselves as writers rather than performers, but at Shryane's urgent request they agreed to stand in for the absentees.Muir, pp. 209\u2013210 Muir was partnered by Isobel Barnett \u2013 a panel show regular \u2013 and Norden by the journalist Nancy Spain. Mason set the questions, and the chairman was the cricket commentator and poet John Arlott, who was billed as \"umpire\". The pilot was well received by the audience in the hall and by listeners to its first transmission. The BBC commissioned a series, which was transmitted in early 1957. Muir and Norden had no intention of becoming regular panellists, but Shyrane persuaded them.", "The programme ran for 38 series, until 1988. Muir and Norden were in every series, always on opposing teams. As Muir's partner, Barnett was succeeded during the first series by the novelist and critic E. Arnot Robertson. On Robertson's death in 1961 the film critic and Greek scholar Dilys Powell took her place until the show finished, when she was aged 87. Norden's first partner was Nancy Spain; after her death in 1964 she was succeeded by the journalist Anne Scott-James, and then from 1979 by the historian Antonia Fraser.

In January 1957 Waugh rewrote the ending, creating a circularity with a return to the words that introduce the novel, and also gave the book its subtitle, \"A Conversation Piece\".
