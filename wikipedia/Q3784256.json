He is known for his work with WWE where he performed under the ring name Drake Maverick. He has also worked for Impact  Wrestling (formerly Total Nonstop Action Wresting), under the ring name Rockstar Spud.\nDuring his first decade, Curtin worked in the British independent circuit, winning several championships in promotions like International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK), One Pro Wrestling (1PW), Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW), and XWA Wrestling. In 2012, he appeared in the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, later Impact Wrestling) program British Boot Camp, winning the competition and being signed to a contract with the promotion. In TNA/Impact, he was a two-time X Division Champion.\nCurtin left Impact in October 2017 and signed a contract with WWE that same month. He would be named as the on-screen General Manager of 205 Live, the brand created by WWE for their cruiserweight division (205 lbs. and under), and served for a brief time as the manager of AOP on Raw. In 2019, he became more active as an in-ring competitor, becoming a eight-time 24/7 Champion. He was released from the company in April 2020 due to budget cuts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following his release, WWE still had Curtin compete in the multi-month Interim NXT Cruiserweight Championship tournament. After losing the finals, he was given a new WWE contract and joined the NXT brand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ted DiBiase", "response": ["On July 22, 2019, DiBiase \"bought\" the WWE 24/7 Championship from Alundra Blayze. The 26-year space between his last title victory in 1993 is reportedly the longest in WWE history. He later lost the title to Drake Maverick in a limousine on the same night."]}, {"page": "R-Truth", "response": ["On the May 20 episode of Raw, WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley unveiled the new WWE 24/7 Championship, a title similar to the Hardcore Championship, which also uses the \"24/7 rule\". Later that night, Truth pinned previous champion Robert Roode in the arena's parking lot to win the title and become the first superstar to win both the Hardcore Championship and 24/7 Championship. The following weeks led to both Truth and Carmella regularly appearing on both Raw and SmackDown Live as part of the 24/7 rule and at more unconventional times and locations (filmed and published on WWE social media), where they would try to flee from other wrestlers wanting to win the title. This led R-Truth to lose the title to multiple superstars such as Heath Slater, Cedric Alexander, Mike Kanellis, Shelton Benjamin, The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson), twice to Jinder Mahal, three times each to Akira Tozawa, Drake Maverick, EC3, Elias, seven times to Mojo Rawley, and usually regain it hours or even minutes later."]}]}}
