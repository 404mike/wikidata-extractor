Employed as a coal miner, he was one of a number of Nottinghamshire-born cricketers who sought professional contracts in Lancashire. The Lancashire cricket leagues began paying the best players to appear for them, creating an exodus of cricketing talent to the county. Crossland first gained employment as a professional cricketer in 1876, with Enfield Cricket Club. In a single innings match against Burnley that season, he took eight wickets and conceded 88 runs (abbreviated as \"eight for 88\"). The following season he once again took eight wickets against the same opposition, finishing with figures of eight for 50. Towards the end of 1877, he was chosen to play for a \"Gentlemen and Players XI\" against Burnley in a benefit match for Burnley's professional John Melling. He took five for 10 in the match from his five overs to help his side win on first innings. In early 1878, Crossland improved upon his previous efforts, taking eight for 28 against Burnley."]}, {"page": "John Melling", "response": ["John Melling may refer to:", "* John Melling (cricketer) (1848\u20131881), English cricketer", "* John Melling (wrestler) (born 1971), British wrestler"]}]}}
