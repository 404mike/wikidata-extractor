Haak is mentioned as convener in an account by John Wallis, who talks about a previous group containing many physicians who then came to Foster's rooms; but Wallis's account is generally seen to be somewhat at variance with the history provided by Thomas Sprat of the Royal Society.http://www.compilerpress.ca/Competitiveness/Anno/Anno%20Johnson%20Gresham.htm"]}, {"page": "Roger Crab", "response": ["Christopher Hill suggested that Crab may have been the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's character the Mad Hatter."]}, {"page": "Ramism", "response": ["* William GougeChristopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965), p. 308."]}]}}
