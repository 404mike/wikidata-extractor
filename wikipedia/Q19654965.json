The first round of the season saw both drivers take their first ever victories, with Jones becoming one of the youngest ever winners in the series. Soon after the event, and following some controversial comments by former-Formula 1 driver Stirling Moss, The Guardian interviewed Wenham about Moss' comments, which she strongly refuted. The following round at Rockingham saw the duo of Jones and Wenham finishing second. This was followed by an unsuccessful round at Silverstone, suffering from mechanical maladies all weekend, and eventually finishing 34th overall. Snetterton saw her and Jones finish third in race one, and fifth in race two. At Brands Hatch, she finished the race, but finished 22nd and last overall. She was unable to compete in the Zandvoort round due to \"extenuating circumstances\", and switched to Blendini/Triple-R for the season finale, partnered Rory Bryant. She finished the season classified fifth in the GT4 driver's standings, with 130.5 points. In November, she was selected as the UK's only representative for the Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup selection shootout. However, she was unsuccessful, and the scholarship was awarded to Lucile Cypriano."]}, {"page": "2014 British GT Championship", "response": ["|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|align=left|  Declan Jones"]}, {"page": "2014 Ginetta GT4 Supercup", "response": ["|  Declan Jones", "|align=left|  Declan Jones"]}, {"page": "2016 Ginetta GT4 Supercup", "response": ["|  Declan Jones", "|align=left|  Declan Jones"]}, {"page": "2017 Ginetta GT4 Supercup", "response": ["|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|  Declan Jones", "|align=left|  Declan Jones"]}, {"page": "2019 Ginetta GT4 Supercup", "response": ["| Declan Jones Racing", "|  Declan Jones", "| rowspan=2| Declan Jones Racing", "|align=left|  Declan Jones"]}]}}
