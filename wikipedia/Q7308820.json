He is the oldest cricketer to appear in the County Championship.\nBorn in Huyton, Liverpool, Moss played most of his first-class cricket for Oxford University, appearing 13 times between 1887 and 1890; he won a blue in 1889. His first match in 1887 was against Lancashire, for whom he had played a handful of minor games before going up to Keble College, Oxford, while his best bowling performance came in his final university game, when he took 4-9 against Sussex.His interest in athletics prevented Moss from appearing more often; he came third against Cambridge in the shot put. After leaving Oxford, Moss played two matches in the 1893 season: an ineffective performance against Lancashire for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's (he scored 3 and 4 and did not bowl or take a catch), and an only marginally more productive appearance for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians, in which he took 0-23 and made 13 in an innings defeat.\nMoss was to make only one further appearance, for Worcestershire, but extraordinarily this came in the 1925 County Championship, nearly 32 years after his previous first-class game when Moss was 57. Batting at number 9 in the first innings and number 11 in the second, he made 2 and 0 and, coming in with just 19 needed for Worcestershire to win the match, he was \"an easy victim for Hammond\" according to The Times. But he fared better in the field, picking up the wicket of Gloucestershire opener Michael Green and holding two catches. He is identified on the scorecard of this match as \"The Rev R. H. Moss\": he was Rector of Icomb, Gloucestershire.\nHe died at the age of 88 in Bridport, Dorset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huyton", "response": ["Huyton has its own cricket club, located off Huyton Lane which was founded in the mid-1860s by the Stone family and the town has produced at least one first class cricketer: Reginald Moss.", "*Reginald Moss, cricketer."]}, {"page": "Moss (surname)", "response": ["* Reginald Moss (1913\u20131995), British Labour Party Member of Parliament 1955\u20131959", "* Reginald Moss (1868\u20131956), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Reginald Moss", "response": ["Reginald Moss may refer to:", "* Reginald Moss (cricketer) (1868\u20131956), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Reginald Heber Moss", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Moss (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Reginald Moss (1893) : R.
