A leading reformer, Durham played a major role in the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832. He later served as ambassador to Russia. He was a founding member and chairman of the New Zealand Company that played a key role in the colonisation of New Zealand. George Woodcock says that he was, \"Proud, wayward, immensely rich, with romantic good looks and an explosive temper.\" He was one of those \"natural rebels who turn their rebellious energies to constructive purposes. Both at home and abroad  he became a powerful exponent of the early nineteenth-century liberal spirit.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*1792 \u2013 John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, English soldier and politician, Lord Privy Seal (d. 1840)"]}, {"page": "Province of Canada", "response": ["The Province of Canada (or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867.
