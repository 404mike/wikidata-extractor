Wigod invited William to Wallingford where he then crossed the river, aiding him in his conquest of England. The Domesday Book records him as both a Lord and an Overlord in a number of places in 1066.His daughter Ealdgyth married Robert D'Oyly, one of William's lords.

It is in Wallingford that Stigand the Archbishopric of Canterbury surrendered and submitted to William, thereby all but ending opposition to William's ascent to the throne. From Wallingford, William with Stigand and his armies rode east to Berkhamsted, where he received the final surrender from Edgar and the rest of the English leadership before marching on London for his coronation on Christmas Day. At that time, the river at Wallingford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded. The town subsequently stood in high favour with the Normans. The Domesday Book of 1085 lists Wallingford as one of only 18 towns in the kingdom with a population of over 2,000 people. Wallingford Castle was built soon afterward on the orders of William, and became a key strategic centre controlling the Thames crossing and surrounding area."]}, {"page": "Shabbington", "response": ["In the reign of Edward the Confessor a Saxon thegn, Wigod of Wallingford, held the manor of Shabbington. In the Norman conquest of England, Wigod supported the invader William of Normandy and afterwards Wigod gave his daughter Ealdgyth in marriage to the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly, who had Wallingford Castle built. Ealdgyth bore D'Oyly no male heir so the D'Oyly estates passed to their daughter Maud or Matilda, and then to her first husband Miles Crispin, who may have been the first castellan of Wallingford Castle. Shabbington remained part of the Honour of Wallingford until the 16th century, when the Wallingford estates became part of the Honour of Ewelme."]}, {"page": "Guy of Warwick", "response": ["The Anglo-Norman warrior hero of Gui de Warewic, marked Guy's first appearance in the early thirteenth century. Topographical allusions show the poem's composer to be more familiar with the area of Wallingford, near Oxford, than with Warwickshire.The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911 suggested a historic connection through etymology: \"The name Guy (perhaps a Norman form of Early English wig, \"war\") may be fairly connected with the family of Wigod, lord of Wallingford under Edward the Confessor.\"", "The name Guy, of Germanic origin, and brought to Britain by the Normans, suggests a Norman adaptation of an Anglo-Saxon name (if indeed the legend was built upon an historic, pre-Norman figure), possibly of the Anglo-Saxon name-element, wig (\"war\"). This is amongst the reasons for the consideration of historical figures who have other suggestive concordances with the legendary Guy. A cupbearer to Edward the Confessor, Wigod of Wallingford, who was also later favoured by William the Conqueror, and whose daughter and granddaughter held the lordship of Wallingford up to the time of Henry II, is one such candidate. Another possible historical inspiration of the romance is an historical Siward, who was sheriff of Warwickshire shortly before the Norman conquest, and had, according to documents quoted by Dugdale, a daughter of the unusual name of Felicia."]}, {"page": "Robert D'Oyly", "response": ["Robert was the son of Walter D'Oyly and elder brother to Nigel D'Oyly.

After Wigod's death, William appointed Robert the lord of Wallingford, and ordered him to fortify Wallingford Castle between 1067 and 1071.

Robert had married Wigod's daughter Ealdgyth, and ultimately inherited many of his father-in-law's lands. The wooden castle was built in the north-east corner of the town, taking advantage of the old Anglo-Saxon ramparts, with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford, and required substantial demolition work to make room for the new motte-and-bailey structure.Armitage, p.437; Pounds, p.207. Unusually, it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high-status Anglo-Saxon housing, probably belonging to former housecarls.Creighton, p.140. The motte today is 60 metres (197 feet) across and 13 metres (43 feet) high.

He or his heirs granted parts of the manor lands at Weston to Osney Abbey, including six virgates given by Robert (II)'s wife Edith and son Henry, and confirmed by his grandson Henry (II) D'Oyly.  In 1137 Edith gave  at Weston to the new Otley Abbey at Oddington, which later moved to Thame.  Henry (II) D'Oyly sold most of the remainder of the manor to Osney Abbey in 1227, retaining only the house, watermill and demesne lands.
