Under the leadership of Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Jeff and Jessie Stephen the Glasgow Women's Housing Association became the driving force behind the rent strike that started in May 1915 in the industrialised area of Govan. Tenants refused to pay the latest increase in rents and staged mass demonstrations against evictions, resulting in violent confrontations. With the start of the First World War local young men left Glasgow to serve in the army overseas, and the first violent protest in the Govan district took place in April to resist the eviction of a soldier's family. As evictions were repeatedly attempted with support from the police, women attacked the factors and the sheriffs' men."]}, {"page": "Maria Fyfe", "response": ["She was quoted as saying: \"I am proudest of having been involved in the 50-50 campaign to ensure that the Scottish Parliament started life with an almost equal representation of women, up there with the Scandinavian countries\".

These women left behind were seen as an easy target and were faced with a rent increase of up to 25% and would be forcibly evicted by bailiffs if they failed to pay. As a result of this rent increase, there was a popular backlash against the landlords and a rent strike was initiated. This was led by Mary Barbour, Mary Burns Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Agnes Dollan, and other women who were dubbed 'Mrs. Barbour's Army'. During rent strikes, women would forcibly prevent the bailiffs from entering the tenements to deliver eviction notices by pelting them with flour bombs, pulling down their trousers, or throwing them into the 'midden' (trash) in the back court of tenement buildings. The strikes soon spread and became an overwhelming success, moving out from Glasgow and on to other cities throughout the UK, that the government, on 27 November 1915, introduced legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level."]}, {"page": "Bailie", "response": ["*Mary Barbour, Glasgow Corporation's first woman Baillie (1924-1927)"]}, {"page": "Barbour", "response": ["*Mary Barbour (1875\u20131958), a Scottish political activist"]}, {"page": "Clyde Workers' Committee", "response": ["The initial demands for higher pay were largely successful,William Knox, James Maxton, p.20 and the committee took up the matter of high rents - an influx of workers to staff the factories producing war materials had pushed up rents.Ian F.
