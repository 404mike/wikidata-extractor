The family moved back to England soon after and settled in Seaforth, Lancashire, where Bellis began to excel at football. He was playing open-age football for top Bootle league side Seaforth Fellowship when he was just sixteen years old and signed for Formby United in August 1921, aged 17.\nAfter two seasons he moved to Southport for three years before moving to fellow Third Division North side Wrexham in 1927. He scored on his debut for the Welsh club, the only goal in a 1\u20130 win at Chesterfield, and became a mainstay of the team's defence.\nBellis graduated to the Second Division to play with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1929, and was part of the championship-winning side of 1931\u201332. Bellis's stay in the top flight lasted only a matter of months before he joined Burnley in December 1932. He was soon awarded the captaincy.\nIn the close season of 1935 Bellis joined his final league club, Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic in Division Three South.\nIn 1937, aged 33, he left to join Wellington Town.\nHe later moved back to Seaforth and died in the area in 1969, aged 64.", "link_mentions": {}}}
