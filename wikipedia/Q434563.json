In a BBC Radio 4 interview, Assyriologist Eleanor Robson credits this to the feminist movement of the 1970's, when, two years after attending a lecture by Cyrus H. Gordon in 1976, American anthropologist Marta Weigle introduced Enheduanna to an audience of feminist scholars as \"the first known author in world literature\" with her introductory essay \"Women as Verbal Artists: Reclaiming the Sisters of Enheduanna.\" Robson says that after this publication, the \"feminist image of Enheduanna... as a wish fulfillment figure\" really took off  Rather than as a \"pioneer poetess\" of feminism, Robson states that the picture of Enheduanna from the surviving works of the 18th century BCE is instead one of her as \"her fathers' political and religious instrument\"  Robson also stresses that we have neither \"access to what Enheduanna thought or did\" or \"evidence that (Enheduanna) was able to write\", but that as the high priestess and daughter of Sargon of Akkad, Enheduanna was \"probably the most privileged woman of her time\"  who likely could have had other people write poetry on her behalf. Robson explains this difference between the popular and scholarly conceptions of Enheduanna as \"not really what people want to hear, so they possibly choose not to hear it\" but she also admits that specialists such as herself may also not communicate clearly enough."]}, {"page": "Nimrud", "response": ["Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and were conducted at intervals between then and 1879, and then from 1949 onwards.
