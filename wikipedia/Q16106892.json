It was he who played the famous ocarina motif on Ennio Morricone's theme for \"For A Few Dollars More\". Years later he would play lead ethnic flutes on Mike Batt's score for the film \"Caravans\" starring Anthony Quinn and based on the James Michener novel. The exact same ocarina that he had used for Morricone's iconic hit was later used on Katie Melua's \"Nine Million Bicycles\" international hit, written and arranged by Batt", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sky (English/Australian band)", "response": ["In September 1984, Sky began recording their seventh album, The Great Balloon Race, in Kevin Peek's Tracks Studio in Western Australia.

The Great Balloon Race was the first Sky album to feature entirely original material without any classical content, although two pieces (\"Allegro\" and \"Caldando\") were strongly classically inspired. Guests included Aspery, Fothergill, pan-pipe player Adrian Brett and former Jeff Beck Band keyboard player Tony Hymas (who contributed the unusual semi-spoken album opener \"Desperate For Your Love\").

The two had known each other only casually, as Mercury was a fan of Buddy Holly and would occasionally attend McCartney's Holly-inspired events over the years. However, they became proper friends following socializing that took place after Live Aid. McCartney, who had sympathy for Mercury due to the press stalking him for stories about his health, wrote the song with Mercury in mind. Mercury, however, was inundated with work, both solo and with Queen, and McCartney continued the project without him. McCartney's pitch, phrasing and key on the finished track are all very similar to the guide vocal demo he created for Mercury when he was attached to the project. Linda McCartney revealed that Paul was devastated by Mercury's death when she appeared alone on British TV a few days after Mercury died. The track was recorded at Hog Hill Studio on 11 and 12 March 1987 with overdubs added at Abbey Road in July. During this session, a full orchestra was overdubbed, as well as instrumental contributions by Stan Sulzmann (saxophone), Nigel Kennedy (violin), and Adrian Brett (flute).Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969\u20132013), L.I.L.Y.
