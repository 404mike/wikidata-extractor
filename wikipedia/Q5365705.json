He claimed to have seen a ghost, described as an elemental figure covered with spots, when he was five years old.

He explained that the picture was the deliberate result of an experiment in the techniques of double exposures, a subject that interested him greatly at the time. Although Latchmore refused to disclose the identity of the individual who had posed as the ghostly figure, it seems likely that it was a young man well known for practical jokes, Latchmore's good friend Reginald Hine. Hine re-published the photograph in 1929 in his History of Hitchin but never admitted it was a fake nor his own part in it.Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine pp113-116"]}, {"page": "Spring-heeled Jack", "response": ["This news was followed by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 one of the most notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in Aldershot Garrison. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp peered into the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure \"advancing towards him.\" The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came up beside him and delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired blanks at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots.

In later years, he has chronicled the lives of the poet and dramatist Stephen Phillips, the self-destructive poet Lionel Johnson, the curious poet and musician Theophile Marzials, and the prolific naturalist the Rev.

In 2010, he published a biography of the mysterious Teresa Higginson, a religious fanatic who believed herself to be tormented by the Devil, and who is thought by some to have a claim to sainthood.

He describes how a clergyman, \"The Rev.\u00a0Mr\u00a0H.\" and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost. The ghost, keeping her face concealed, led \"The Rev.\u00a0Mr\u00a0H.\" into drunkenness, and his children into cruelty towards animals, until they themselves behaved like pigs.

Victorian ideals saw women as moral, passive and physically weak or restrained. Webster was seen as quite the opposite and was described in lurid ways that emphasised her lack of femininity. Elliott O'Donnell, writing in his introduction to the trial transcript, described Webster as \"not merely savage, savage and shocking... but the grimmest of grim personalities, a character so uniquely sinister and barbaric as to be hardly human.\" The newspapers described her as \"gaunt, repellent, and trampish-looking\", though the reporter for The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times commented that she was \"not so ill-favoured as she has been described\"."]}, {"page": "The Novel Magazine", "response": ["Contributors of fiction to The Novel Magazine included Rafael Sabatini, Adrian, Jack,  and Cox, Michael, The Oxford Book of Historical Stories.
