Although the Goblin score has been variously available since the film's release, it was not until 2004 that any of the highly sought-after 60-plus cues of library music used in the film were released on a compilation album from Trunk Records. In 2009, virtually all the cues used (actually 74 of a total 86 library music pieces) were researched, identified & catalogued by Robert McLaine, Darren Stuart, John Toman, Allen Lighthiser, Patrick J. Doody, Llyswen Vaughn & Chris Stavrakis, and published on the Dawn Of The Dead Ultimate Soundtrack website.  The album included 'Cause I'm a Man' written by Cliff Twemlow and Peter Taylor under the pen name Peter Reno and recorded by the Pretty Things, and Herbert Chappell's 1965 composition \"The Gonk\" which plays over the final credits. The track is used in many references to the film including Shaun of the Dead and a variation (performed in chicken clucks) is used as the end theme to Robot Chicken. The early part of the tune to \"The Gonk\" was used in \"The Ladies' Bras\", a track by Jonny Trunk and Wisbey which, at only 36 seconds long, became the shortest ever UK top 40 single when it made number 27 on 30 September 2007. Shaun of the Dead opens with the track \"Figment\" which also features on the compilation. The album's cover is taken from a Belgian promotional poster for the film."]}, {"page": "Twemlow (surname)", "response": ["*Cliff Twemlow (1937\u20131993), English actor, nightclub bouncer, horror paperback author, and library music composer"]}, {"page": "Brian Sterling-Vete", "response": ["Sterling began working as a TV & Film Stunt Performer when offered work on projects by the Mancunian author, songwriter, composer and film producer Cliff Twemlow.", "Projects in collaboration with writer and producer Cliff Twemlow included: The Pike", "2015, August 6, Sterling published the book Tuxedo Warriors. which is his autobiography and also the biography of author, music composer, actor, and cult film producer, Cliff Twemlow, between 1977 and Twemlow's death in 1993.
