At this time, he also helped form the short-lived band the Jive Bombers that played the established London gig circuit at such venues as The Hope and Anchor, Islington, the Greyhound, the 100 Club and the Marquee Club. The band stayed together for six months and was not able to realise any potential recording career, despite Ted Caroll's offer of a record deal on his own label Chiswick Records. The band members included Iain \"Thumper\" Thompson, who went on to help form the successful chart act Darts, the guitarist Martin Stone and drummer Wilgar Campbell. This period, however, did culminate in some further recordings that achieved chart activity for Lewie in Europe as a solo recording artist, with two of his Sonet singles \"Cherry Ring\" and \"Come Away (Bate O Pe)\", leading to solo TV appearances in central and northern Europe."]}, {"page": "Larry Wallis", "response": ["Wallis remained with Pink Fairies, which continued as a trio, until July 1976 when they gained additional guitarist, Martin Stone.
