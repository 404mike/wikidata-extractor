Part of the Sowerby family, he was eldest son of Charles Edward Sowerby and grandson of James Sowerby. John inherited a taste for botanical drawing, and in 1841 produced his first work\u2014the plates for his father's Illustrated Catalogue of British Plants. His life was thenceforth mainly spent in illustrating botanical works, in collaboration with Charles Johnson (1791\u20131880), and Charles Pierpoint Johnson, who contributed the text. His only independent work was An Illustrated Key to the Natural Orders of British Wild Flowers, published in 1865. He died on 28 January 1870 in London at Lavender Hill, Clapham. He married on 10 February 1853 Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Roger and Ann Dewhurst of Preston, Lancashire. She survived him, and, in recognition of the scientific value of his work, was granted a civil list pension.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sowerby family", "response": ["***John Edward Sowerby (1825-1870)"]}, {"page": "Sowerby (surname)", "response": ["**John Edward Sowerby (1825\u20131870), artist and publisher "]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (I\u2013J)", "response": ["* J.E.Sowerby \u2013 John Edward Sowerby (1825\u20131870)"]}, {"page": "Henry Groves", "response": ["In the early 1870s, a chance meeting with the family of John Edward Sowerby led to a deeper interest in English botany and the works of the late botanist. In 1874 the brothers Henry and James joined the South London Microscopical and Natural History Club where they met many botanists including T. B. Blow. They made a botanical excursion to Thames Ditton with Hewett Cottrell Watson and Blow apart from visit to the botanical section of the British Museum. From 1877, the two brothers took a keen interest in British Characeae. They also took an interest in molluscs. Henry left the stockbroker office after the death of the owner in 1879. In 1880 the two brothers published a review of the British Characeae. In 1884, Henry became Secretary of the South London Microscopical and Natural History Club until the club was dissolved in 1897. Henry was admitted Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1892 where his knowledge of financial matters helped the organization."]}, {"page": "John E.
