For those who don't know what the Gazette is, it's a quick way of giving them an idea of its singular authority.  Presumably the same parameters could also be used for the Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes (I'm not quite clear what goes in these rather than the London one), just using a different GeoType parameter?
