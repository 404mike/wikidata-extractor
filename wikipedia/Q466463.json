Jason has a good relationship with all his siblings, but is especially close to his older brother John-Boy. Though the two brothers have very different personalities and interests, they get along very well. The two became very close when John-Boy began college and their bond grew even stronger as the years went by. Age 15 in season one, he is a somewhat-introverted but good-natured musician who enjoys composing music for harmonica, guitar, and piano, some of which graced the show. He is a favorite of the Baldwin sisters, who often ask him to play the piano and sing for them. In season three, Jason attends the Kleinberg Conservatory of Music; in season four he lands a job playing  honkytonk piano at local tavern The Dew Drop Inn (which he later comes to own), much to Grandma's and Olivia's chagrin. In season five, Jason joins the National Guard to earn some extra money. In season seven, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he struggles with the idea of killing another man and considers becoming a conscientious objector. He ultimately decides against this, and by season eight he joins the Army and is promoted to the rank of sergeant. While stationed as a drill instructor in the fictitious Camp Rockfish near Walton's Mountain, he meets a beautiful WAC sergeant, Antoinette \u201cToni\u201d Hazelton, who is also musically talented.
