He did not make his debut for the club until the following season, in a 1\u20130 win over Hull City, but he eventually managed to force his way into the side during the 1953\u201354 season. He scored his first goal for Cardiff in a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 1954. He helped the club avoid relegation on the final day of the season in the next season but injury ruled him out for all but one game during the 1955-56 campaign, making an incredible return the next year by scoring a hattrick during a 7-0 thrashing of Barnsley.He left the club in November 1958 and signed for Mansfield Town where he spent two years before moving into non-league football with Weymouth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nugent (surname)", "response": ["* Cliff Nugent (born 1929), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|January 1951||Cliff Nugent||Cardiff City||align=right|\u00a32,500"]}, {"page": "1958\u201359 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Cliff Nugent"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Cliff Nugent"]}]}}
