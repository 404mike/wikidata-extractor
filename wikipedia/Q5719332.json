From 1882 to 1885 he was one of the City's representatives on the London School Board. He was elected a bencher of Gray's Inn and was treasurer in the year before his death.Active in Conservative politics, he unsuccessfully attempted to win a seat for the party at Northampton in 1885, 1886, 1892. At the 1895 general election he contested the London constituency of Finsbury East. He won the seat, defeating the sitting Liberal Member of Parliament, James Rowlands.

He was appointed chairman of the City Branch of the Church Defence Institution in 1877 and three years later formed the City Church and Churchyard Preservation Society.He inherited his father's home \"Caerhages\", West Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea.

Richards had hoped that the medieval preaching cross would be reconstructed, but the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral decided that this would be out of keeping with the architectural setting, Sir Christopher Wren having rebuilt the cathedral in the 17th century. The resulting monument is to a Baroque revival design by Sir Reginald Blomfield, with a statue of Saint Paul by Sir Bertram Mackennal standing on a Doric column of Portland stone. The cathedral authorities' use of Richards's funds aroused a short-lived controversy. In 1972 the monument was listed at Grade II.
