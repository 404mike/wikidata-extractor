During the inter-war years Holt remained in the RAF, serving in several staff appointments before becoming Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area.\nHolt was killed in a flying accident not long after taking up his final appointment. He was flying in a de Havilland DH.60M Moth from RAF Tangmere to take him back to RAF Uxbridge when it crashed at Seahurst Park near Chichester, following a collision with an Armstrong Whitworth Siskin. Holt managed to get out of the aircraft, but his parachute did not open in time.", "link_mentions": {}}}
