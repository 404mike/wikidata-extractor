The leading candidate at that time was the Nile perch, which already lived in nearby Lake Albert. At the time Graham wrote \"The introduction of a large predatory species from another area would be attended with the upmost danger, unless preceded by extensive research into the probable effects of this operation\". In a footnote he added that his warning had just been strengthened by a recent research report from Lake Albert, which described how rare the tilapia had become.Graham M. (1929.)
