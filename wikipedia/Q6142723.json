In this way he disposed of more than \u00a31.5 million, mainly in disastrous speculations. Unable to face the consequences, he committed suicide near Jack Straw's Tavern on Hampstead Heath on 17 February 1856 by drinking prussic acid. The Times reported that \"[t]he body of Mr J.

A large bottle labelled \"Oil of Bitter Almonds\" and a jug also containing the poison (prussic acid) lay by his side.\"The Times 18 February 1856 The body was identified by Edwin James QC MP and Thomas Wakley MP, editor of The Lancet. His brother James Sadleir, also an MP, was found to be deeply implicated in the fraud, having conspired with his younger brother. He was expelled from the House of Commons on 16 February 1857. He fled to the Continent, settling in Zurich and then Geneva.
