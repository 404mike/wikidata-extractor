He was their longest-serving player when he transferred to Leicester City in January 2012. \nMorgan became Leicester's captain later that year, and captained the club for 9 years until his retirement in 2021. He captained the club during its most successful ever period, captaining them to the Championship title in 2014, their first Premier League title two years later in 2016 and their first FA Cup win in 2021, in which he made his final ever professional appearance coming on as a substitute in the 2021 FA Cup Final.\nBorn and raised in England, Morgan chose to represent Jamaica at international level, making his debut for them in 2013 and was part of their teams that competed in two Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments and finished runners-up at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Opportunities like this you can't turn down.\" He also thanked his former club and their fans, saying, \"This is the right move for me at the right time and I would like to thank everyone at Bolton because I've had a great four years at the football club. My spell with Wanderers has enabled me to break into the England squad, and I would particularly like to thank the fans for their support along the way.

He scored his first league goal for the club in the following match, opening the scoring in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Manchester City.

But he recovered and was recalled to the first-team following the injury of Wes Morgan and helped Forest into second spot at Christmas and scored his first goal of the season in Forest's 4\u20131 home win against Southend United. Breckin made his 100th Forest league appearance in their 2\u20130 victory against Crewe Alexandra, but was then dropped to the bench in favour of Wes Morgan, only making a handful of starts and coming off the bench often towards the end of the season.
