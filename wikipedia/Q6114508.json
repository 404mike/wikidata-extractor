Albion however started to play some good football and got themselves back into the match after 21 minutes when the youngest player on the field, 22-year-old Wally Boyes, a boyhood Wednesdayite from Sheffield scored an equaliser. The diminutive left winger took a pass from Carter and hit a stinging, rising drive from the left side of the penalty area which gave Jack Brown no chance.
