He appeared once for the Gunners, was loaned out to Colchester United, then sold to Bradford City in 1998 where he was part of the squad that gained promotion to the Premier League. Bradford loaned him to Bolton Wanderers, then Birmingham City, before moving him to Barnsley on a permanent deal in 2001. In 2004, he joined Grimsby Town and then Brentford where he remained for two years before returning to Grimsby. During his second spell with The Mariners he spent a month on loan with Macclesfield Town before being released. He then joined Stevenage Borough for the remainder of the 2007\u201308 season. He subsequently played non-league football for Crawley Town, Forest Green Rovers, Ashford Town and Hendon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["* Isaiah Rankin"]}, {"page": "Martin Allen", "response": ["Allen took over from Wally Downes at Second Division side Brentford in March 2004. He had a good run at the club, saving them from relegation to the Third Division in what remained of the 2003\u201304 season. In the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons he took Brentford to the play-offs with fourth and third-place finishes respectively, but they were eliminated by Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City respectively in the semi-finals on both occasions. Allen won press attention during the 2004\u201305 season for the success of his self-described \"two bob team\", which was composed of ageing pros (John Salako, Andy Myers, Scott Fitzgerald and Jamie Lawrence), free transfers (Deon Burton, Chris Hargreaves, Stewart Talbot and Isaiah Rankin) and young guns who would go on to play in the Premier League (Jay Tabb, Stephen Hunt, Sam Sodje and Michael Turner). Allen took Brentford to the fifth round of the FA Cup in two consecutive years, going out to Premier League sides Southampton in the 2004\u201305 season (losing 3\u20131 in a replay, after a 2\u20132 draw at St Mary's) and Charlton Athletic 3\u20131 in the 2005\u201306 season. He also was in charge of one of the major giant killings in the fourth round in the 2005\u201306 season, beating Premier League side Sunderland 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Paul Jewell", "response": ["Richmond turned to Jewell, already Kamara's assistant manager, who then won his first game 2\u20131 to Stockport County. In his 21 games in charge, Jewell won six games and drew five to guide City to 13th, their highest position since Jewell had joined the club. He was rewarded with a permanent contract when others expected Richmond to recruit a higher-profile replacement. Richmond wanted to make a promotion challenge, so Jewell broke the club's transfer record twice within the first week of the 1998\u201399 season, first with the \u00a31m acquisition of Lee Mills and then the \u00a31.3m purchase of Arsenal youngster Isaiah Rankin. He also brought back Stuart McCall from Rangers. After a poor start, when City won just one of its first seven games, they picked up momentum and were second behind Sunderland for most of the latter half of the season. Jewell added Lee Sharpe on loan and a third \u00a31m signing, Dean Windass, as City held off Ipswich Town and Birmingham City to finish second. With promotion to the Premier League, Bradford had returned to top-flight football after an absence of 77 years."]}, {"page": "Sam Allardyce", "response": ["In summer 2000, Gu\u00f0johnsen and Jensen were sold for \u00a34\u00a0million each. Allardyce focused on spending money to improve the club's facilities and backroom staff, believing that money spent in these areas would allow Bolton to compete with clubs who had bigger budgets and paid bigger wages than Bolton could afford. On the playing front he spent \u00a3400,000 on striker Michael Ricketts and \u00a31.5\u00a0million to bring back Frendsen from Blackburn, and also signed utility player Ian Marshall and Bradford City loanee Isaiah Rankin. Teenager Kevin Nolan was also promoted from the youth team, whilst 35-year-old defender Colin Hendry arrived on loan. Bolton reached the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in 2000\u201301, where they beat Preston North End 3\u20130 to achieve promotion to the Premier League after a three-year absence."]}, {"page": "Phil Jevons", "response": ["In July 2001, he was sold to Grimsby Town for \u00a3250,000. Grimsby were playing in the Football League First Division, and Jevons was one of the first signings of the new campaign for manager Lennie Lawrence. He became an instant hit at Blundell Park and helped fire Grimsby to the top of the league within the first five games of the season, notably his partnership with young striker Jonathan Rowan had shown early promise. On 9 October 2001, he scored a long-range goal in extra time of a League Cup fixture against Liverpool to send Grimsby through to the next round knocking Liverpool out. Jevons finished the 2001\u201302 season having played 37 games scoring eight goals in all competitions. After three substitute appearances for Grimsby in the 2002\u201303 season, Jevons was placed on the transfer list due to financial reasons, but was later removed and was sent out on a season-long loan to Humber derby rivals Hull City. He scored three goals in 26 games for Hull, before returning to the Mariners in the summer of 2003 following Grimsby's relegation from the second tier of English football. Following the sacking of Paul Groves and the appointment of Nicky Law, Jevons struck up a good partnership with Isaiah Rankin, he scored four goals in a 6\u20131 victory over Barnsley on 28 February 2004. Despite this the club suffered a second successive relegation, Jevons finished that season with twelve goals and left the club at the end of the season. In total Jevons scored 24 times as a Grimsby Town player."]}, {"page": "Michael Reddy", "response": ["After failing to secure promotion, his manager Russell Slade resigned, and Reddy requested to be put on the transfer list, this was followed by several press reports linking him with a move to newly promoted Premiership side Sheffield United. Though eventually it was Leeds United and Bristol City who made more of a forward approach for the player. Grimsby had also made the signing of striker Isaiah Rankin in the hope of combining the pair in an attempt to make a second assault on promotion from League Two, but Michael still had to contend with his hip injury, which was still being largely persistent. The injury was rumoured to be so bad that it possibly threatened to end his career altogether. Reddy managed to play the odd game, and soon Slade's replacement as manager Graham Rodger was dismissed by the club after a poor start to the season. In turn the club appointed Alan Buckley as his successor, the new Grimsby boss made it clear he wanted to keep Reddy who had by now had undergone hip surgery. Buckley aimed to stick by him through his injury troubles and help the player back to fitness, but with Reddy still harbouring the interests of leaving Blundell Park, he subsequently snubbed fresh contract talks in favour of listening to potential offers from Bristol City. Due to the continued hip problem, City had by now had lost interest altogether in signing him. However Leyton Orient had also made an official approach for Reddy's services, but this came to nothing in the end. Reddy had failed to respond well from his hip surgery and was forced to retire from the game."]}, {"page": "Peter Beagrie", "response": ["Beagrie left Scunthorpe United in June 2006, supposedly to concentrate on his media involvement with Sky Sports which had increased in latter years \u2013 but on 11 July 2006, he signed a one-year deal with Scunthorpe's local rivals, Grimsby Town in a player\u2013coach capacity. His job was to aid new manager Graham Rodger and his new assistant Stuart Watkiss at Blundell Park. He made his first appearance for the club in a 1\u20130 friendly win over Gainsborough Trinity in a game in which he set up the only goal of the game for his former Bradford teammate Isaiah Rankin. His league debut for the club was in a 3\u20132 win over Boston United on the opening day of the season. Grimsby struggled to make ground in the early stages of the season, and Beagrie often found himself playing a cameo role in first team affairs. In October 2006, Beagrie's contract was cancelled by mutual consent. Following this his retirement from football was announced during the You're on Sky Sports programme on 30 October 2006."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Isaiah Rankin||||FW||20042006-2008||1237||42"]}, {"page": "Isaiah (given name)", "response": ["*Isaiah Rankin (born 1978), English football forward"]}, {"page": "Darren Mansaram", "response": ["Mansaram began his career at Grimsby Town progressing through the youth ranks before being promoted to the first team towards the end of the 2001\u201302 season, whilst Town were competing in what is now the Football League Championship. He came into the squad with a good goal scoring record for both the reserve side and youth sides and it wasn't long before he made his break got his break within the first team. During the 2002\u201303 season, Town manager Paul Groves had been dealt several blows by the loss of loanee Steve Kabba as well as injuries to other forwards such as Michael Boulding while Phil Jevons was loaned out for financial reasons, this in turn saw Groves forced to select inexperienced youngsters such as Mansaram and David Soames. Despite impressing in the final half of the season, Mansaram was powerless in helping Grimsby avoid relegation from the First Division, however by the end of the season his performances had meant he was now considered as a first team regular. During the summer months he drew interest from Sheffield Wednesday but no concrete offer came in and the young striker nicknamed 'Flash' due to his lightning pace up front, stayed on at Blundell Park. Paul Groves eventually lost his job in February 2004 and was replaced by Nicky Law who in turn chopped and changed the Grimsby squad meaning signings such as Isaiah Rankin meant that Mansaram by the end of that season had found himself only playing a cameo role within the first team. Following a second successive relegation the Grimsby board installed another new manager in Russell Slade, and Mansaram now out of contract was kept on at the club during pre-season on a trial basis but despite being initially told he wasn't going to be offered a new deal he eventually signed on a 6-month deal. During the 2004\u201305 season, he was loaned out to Conference National side Halifax Town, and eventually moved to the club on a free transfer."]}, {"page": "History of Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["Barnsley's troubles in fighting administration were matched by their struggles on the field, as Barnsley's form continued to be mixed. However, Barnsley were in a position to secure their position and prevent relegation for a second successive season with their final home game of the season against Brentford. After a goalless 92 minutes, Isaiah Rankin scored a dramatic injury time winner, meaning Barnsley could travel to promoted Wigan Athletic knowing they were secure."]}, {"page": "Graham Hockless", "response": ["In the following season manager Paul Groves gave Hockless more of a chance within the first team, and after playing in a handful of games he began to become a regular with his performances making an impact in the team as well.

Kamara used 42\u00a0players in 1996\u201397 when City avoided relegation with a 3\u20130 victory in the final game against Queens Park Rangers. Kamara was sacked in January 1998 after an FA Cup defeat to Manchester City, when Richmond claimed the manager had taken the club as far as he could. Richmond again elevated from within and Paul Jewell, who had been at the club since 1988, was installed as manager, originally on a caretaker basis. He was appointed full-time in May 1998 and Richmond backed his new appointment with a multi-million transfer budget. Jewell signed strikers Lee Mills, from Port Vale and Isaiah Rankin, from Arsenal, for \u00a31\u00a0million and \u00a31.3\u00a0million respectively, and signed former captain Stuart McCall from Rangers on a free transfer to lead the side.

During this run the Vale renewed hostilities with rivals Stoke City, recording a 1\u20131 draw at Burslem on 17 September. Their form stabilized with a four-game unbeaten run throughout November, but then no points were gained from any of the four December games.
