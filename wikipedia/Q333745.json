He was a Member of Parliament for nearly thirty years, and served twice as a Cabinet Minister. He lost his Smethwick parliamentary seat at the 1964 general election, in a bitterly racial campaign conducted in the wake of local factory closures.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["Like Healey and Crosland, he had been a close friend of Hugh Gaitskell and for them Gaitskell's death and the elevation of Harold Wilson as Labour Party leader was a setback. For Jenkins, Gaitskell would remain his political hero.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 230. After the 1964 general election Jenkins was appointed Minister of Aviation and was sworn of the Privy Council. While at Aviation he oversaw the high-profile cancellations of the BAC TSR-2 and Concorde projects (although the latter was later reversed after strong opposition from the French Government). In January 1965 Patrick Gordon Walker resigned as Foreign Secretary and in the ensuing reshuffle Wilson offered Jenkins the Department for Education and Science; however, he declined it, preferring to stay at Aviation.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 249.", "Jenkins' supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party became known as the \"Jenkinsites\". These were usually younger, middle-class and university-educated ex-Gaitskellites such as Bill Rodgers, David Owen, Roy Hattersley, Dick Taverne, John Mackintosh and David Marquand.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 330\u2013331. In May\u2013July 1968 some of his supporters, led by Patrick Gordon Walker and Christopher Mayhew, plotted to replace Wilson with Jenkins as Labour leader but he declined to challenge Wilson.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 332\u2013335. A year later his supporters again attempted to persuade Jenkins to challenge Wilson for the party leadership but he again declined.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 334. He later wrote in his memoirs that the 1968 plot was \"for me...the equivalent of the same season of 1953 for Rab Butler. Having faltered for want of single-minded ruthlessness when there was no alternative to himself, he then settled down to a career punctuated by increasingly wide misses of the premiership. People who effectively seize the prime ministership \u2013 Lloyd George, Macmillan, Mrs Thatcher \u2013 do not let such moments slip\".Jenkins, A Life at the Centre, p. 260."]}, {"page": "Foreign Secretary", "response": ["| Patrick Gordon Walker"]}, {"page": "Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone", "response": ["Hogg participated in his first election campaign in the 1924 general election, and all subsequent general election campaigns until his death. In 1938, Hogg was chosen as a candidate for Parliament in the Oxford by-election. This election took place shortly after the Munich Agreement and the Labour candidate Patrick Gordon Walker was persuaded to step down to allow a unified challenge to the Conservatives; A. D. Lindsay, the Master of Balliol College fought as an 'Independent Progressive' candidate. Hogg narrowly defeated Lindsay, who was said to be horrified by the popular slogan of \"Hitler wants Hogg\"."]}, {"page": "Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford", "response": ["In 1961, Pakenham inherited from his brother the earldom of Longford in the Peerage of Ireland and from then onward was generally known to the public as Lord Longford. When Labour returned to power in October 1964 under Harold Wilson, Longford was appointed Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, despite the fact that Wilson had little respect for him. In December 1965 he became Secretary of State for the Colonies, continuing as Leader of the House of Lords. After only four months at the Colonial Office, he was removed from the post for failing to master his brief, and again became Lord Privy Seal in April 1966. Wilson often talked about sacking Longford from his government, which is believed by some to have led to Longford's resignation as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords in January 1968 \u2013 though the actual occasion of his resignation was the failure of Education Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker to agree to the raising of the school-leaving age.Mary Craig, Longford \u2014 A Biographical Portrait (Hodder & Stoughton, 1978), pp. 149 In 1972 he was created a Knight of the Garter."]}, {"page": "Hugh Gaitskell", "response": ["Gaitskell's political philosophy became known as Gaitskellism, and from the late 1950s brought him into increasing conflict with the trade unions over nationalisation. Besides repudiating the unquestioned commitment to public ownership of the means of production, now seen as merely one of numerous useful devices, he emphasised the goals of personal liberty, social welfare and above all social equality. Gaitskellism tended to downplay loyalty to the Labour movement as a central ethical goal, and argued that the new goals could be achieved if the government used appropriate fiscal and social policy measures within the context of a market-oriented mixed economy. Gaitskell's cadre of supporters included Anthony Crosland, Roy Jenkins, Douglas Jay, Patrick Gordon Walker and James Callaghan.Brian Harrison, Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951\u20131970 (2011) ch 8."]}, {"page": "By-election", "response": ["In 1965 the British Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker stood in the Leyton by-election for election to the UK Parliament, having been defeated in controversial circumstances in Smethwick at the previous year's general election. His appointment as a senior minister while not a member of either house of Parliament was against convention, and he therefore sought to regularise the position by standing in the first available by-election, which was at Leyton in January 1965. However a strong swing against Labour resulted in Gordon Walker's defeat: as a result, he resigned as Foreign Secretary."]}, {"page": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Cabinet is now made up almost entirely of members of the House of Commons, with the Peel convention dicating that ministers may only be recruited from the House of Commons or the House of Lords (though this convention has been broken in the past, the case of Patrick Gordon Walker perhaps being the most notable exception). Sometimes, when a minister from neither House is appointed, they have been granted a customary peerage."]}, {"page": "Commonwealth realm", "response": ["The Commonwealth's prime ministers discussed the matter of the new monarch's title, with St. Laurent stating at the 1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference that it was important to agree on a format that would \"emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries.\" The result was a new Royal Style and Titles Act being passed in each of the seven realms then existing (excluding Pakistan), which all identically gave formal recognition to the separateness and equality of the countries involved, and replaced the phrase \"British Dominions Beyond the Seas\" with \"Her Other Realms and Territories\", the latter using the word realm in place of dominion. Further, at her coronation, Elizabeth II's oath contained a provision requiring her to promise to govern according to the rules and customs of the realms, naming each one separately. The change in perspective was summed up by Patrick Gordon Walker's statement in the British House of Commons: \"We in this country have to abandon... any sense of property in the Crown. The Queen, now, clearly, explicitly and according to title, belongs equally to all her realms and to the Commonwealth as a whole.\" In the same period, Walker also suggested to the British parliament that the Queen should annually spend an equal amount of time in each of her realms. Lord Altrincham, who in 1957 criticised Queen Elizabeth II for having a court that encompassed mostly Britain and not the Commonwealth as a whole, was in favour of the idea, but it did not attract wide support. Another thought raised was that viceregal appointments should become trans-Commonwealth; the governor-general of Australia would be someone from South Africa, the governor-general of Ceylon would come from New Zealand, and so on. The prime ministers of Canada and Australia, John Diefenbaker and Robert Menzies, respectively, were sympathetic to the concept, but, again, it was never put into practice."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations", "response": ["| Patrick Gordon WalkerMP for Smethwick"]}]}}
