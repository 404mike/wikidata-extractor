Robert Chazan's belief is that the effect was minimal in the end \u2013 both cultures were, in many ways, used to the persecution that was being enacted, and that this was just another step. R. I. Moore, within his book The Formation of a Persecuting Society, argues that the effect on Christians was huge, with their entire society gaining feelings of the need for separation from their Jewish neighbors, which allowed them to persecute further in the future. Ivan G. Marcus in his article The Culture of the Early Ashkenaz argues that the Jews pulled away from the Christian community physically, mentally, and spiritually due to the sheer ferocity and shocking nature of the crusades. All of these and more provide differing opinions on the results of the crusades, but all agree that the crusades caused a separation to occur between the two religions."]}, {"page": "History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance", "response": ["The process of centralizing power included the development of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities. R. I. Moore says the European nation-states had not exhibited a \"habit\" of persecuting minorities before the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  Jews, lepers, heretics and gays were the first minorities to be persecuted, and they were followed in the next few centuries by Gypsies, beggars, spendthrifts, prostitutes, and discharged soldiers. They were all vulnerable to whatever degree they existed \"outside\" the community.  Religious persecution had certainly been familiar in the Roman empire, and remained so throughout the history of the Byzantine Empire, but it had largely faded away in the West before reappearing in the eleventh century. The various persecutions of minorities became established over the next hundred years. In this it was \"determined, not only over whom, but also by whom, the [increasing] power of government was to be exercised.\"", "There is a vast array of scholarly opinions on heresy, including whether it actually existed. Russell says that, as the church became more centralized and hierarchical, it was able to more clearly define orthodoxy than it ever had been before, and concepts of heresy developed along with it as a result.  Mitchell Merback speaks of three groups involved in the persecution of heresy: the civil authorities, the church and the people.  Historian R. I. Moore says the part the church played in turning dissent into heresy has been overestimated.  According to Moore, the increased significance of heresy in the High Middle Ages reflects the secular powers' recognition of the devastating nature of the heretic's political message: that heretics were independent of the structures of power.  James A. Brundage writes that the formal prosecution of heresy was codified in civil law, and was generally left to the civil authorities before this period.  Russell adds that heresy became common only after the Third Lateran Council in 1179."]}, {"page": "Robert Moore", "response": ["*R. I.
