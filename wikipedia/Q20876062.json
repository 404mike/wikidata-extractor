From then and until the end of the season, he only made 5 appearances. Coming into the 2021-22 campaign, Blair has become a first-team regular. And following the departure of Ross County legend Michael Gardyne to Highland rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Blair was given the number 7 to wear on his back. A number that, if you ask a life-long Ross County fan, leaves quite a big pair of boots to fill. Due to COVID-19 complications, Ross County were unable to play any of their League Cup group stage games, so the attention for Blair turned to the Premiership. Since then however, Blair has scored 4 goals since his return to Dingwall. He bagged a brace in a 2-2 draw at home to Hearts, his third came from a 2-3 defeat at home to St. Mirren, and his fourth from a 1-0 home win against Hibernian. At a time where the club were in much need of points. He is currently the second highest top scorer at the club behind Regan Charles-Cook with 5 goals at the time."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| 3 February 2017 || CM ||  || Regan Charles-Cook || Solihull Moors || 29 April 2017 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["|=||MF||||24||Regan Charles-Cook||0||0||0||1||0||1", "|Regan Charles-Cook", "| 1 September 2017 || RW ||  || Regan Charles-Cook || Woking || 6 January 2018 || ", "| 1 September 2017 || RW ||  || Regan Charles-Cook || Woking || 28 April 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["On 16 June 2017, Exeter City were drawn at home to Charlton Athletic in the first round of the EFL Cup.
