He embarked on a political career, and was a Member of Parliament.\nGraham was born into the nobility, the younger son of a duke, and embarked on a naval career early in his life. Rising through the ranks, he was given his first commands early in the War of the Austrian Succession, and served in the Mediterranean and in escorting convoys. He entered parliament through the influence of his father, and represented the Scottish constituency of Stirlingshire from 1741 until his death. He was a Whig and a political supporter of the Duke of Argyll.\nTurning down the command of a ship of the line in favour of a frigate, Graham won renown for a victory over several powerful privateers and their prizes. Rewarded with a larger ship, he also commissioned a painting from William Hogarth to commemorate the event, Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin. He continued in the navy, intercepting privateers and enemy ships, but was struck down with a severe illness, and despite moving ashore, died in 1747.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1747", "response": ["* January 2 \u2013 Lord George Graham, Royal Navy officer and MP (b. 1715)"]}, {"page": "1715", "response": ["* September 26 \u2013 Lord George Graham, Royal Navy officer and MP (d. 1747)"]}, {"page": "David Mallet (writer)", "response": ["Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin.jpg|Mallet with Captain Lord George Graham, on Graham's ship the Lark, painted by William Hogarth"]}, {"page": "George Graham", "response": ["*Lord George Graham (1715\u20131747), naval officer, MP for Stirlingshire"]}, {"page": "James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose", "response": ["He was the only son of James Graham, 3rd Marquess of Montrose and Lady Christian Leslie.
