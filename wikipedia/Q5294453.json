Donald Guthrie says no single theory offers a complete solution as there are complex and important difficulties that create challenges to every theory. One example is Basil Christopher Butler's challenge to the legitimacy of two-source theory, arguing it contains a Lachmann fallacy that says the two-source theory loses cohesion when it is acknowledged that no source can be established for Mark.

No conclusive evidence has yet been produced to settle the question of genre, and without genre, no adequate parallels can be found, and without parallels \"it must be considered to what extent the principles of literary criticism are applicable\".

Over forty passages in Ephesians are expansions or variations of passages in Colossians. E. F. Scott argued that Paul used one letter as a model for the other,Scott, The Epistles of Paul to the Colossians, to Philemon and to the Ephesians (1930) p. 121 whereas others have considered Ephesians to be derivative of Colossians, edited and reworked by another.e.g. Mitton, The Epistle to the Ephesians (1951) pp. 245-255 Donald Guthrie summarized the implications of this: \"Advocates of non-Pauline authorship find it difficult to conceive that one mind could have produced two works possessing so remarkable a degree of similarity in theme and phraseology and yet differing in so many other respects, whereas advocates of Pauline authorship are equally emphatic that two minds could not have produced two such works with so much subtle interdependence blended with independence.\"Guthrie p. 511", "Despite this, these epistles were accepted as genuine by many, perhaps most of the ante-Nicene Church Fathers.A few Fathers do not mention these epistles by name, instead quoting passages found in these letters (without making it clear that they are quoting anything at all), and there is no evidence in the surviving writings of Ignatius and Justin Martyr that proves their familiarity with these texts. Some scholars have argued that the letters were certainly accepted as Pauline by the time of Irenaeus.see Bernard xv; James pp. 5-24 They were also included in the Muratorian fragment. According to Jerome, the gnostic Christian Basilides also rejected these epistles, and Tatian, while accepting Titus, rejected other Pauline epistles.Guthrie 1990:610 Marcion (c. 140) excluded all three, along with Hebrews, from his otherwise complete Pauline corpus, and it is impossible to determine whether or not he knew of them. Donald Guthrie, for instance, argues that Marcion's theology would have been cause to reject the letters since it was incompatible with certain passages, such as 1 Tim 1:8 and 1 Tim 6:20, while Ehrman suggests that 2nd-century proto-orthodox Christians had motivation to forge the Pastorals to combat the Gnostic use of other Pauline epistles.Ehrman 2003:240 Even the ancient writer Tertullian (c. 220), in Adv. Marc. V.21, expresses confusion as to why these epistles had not been included in Marcion's canon.
