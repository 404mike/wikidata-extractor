Hick contends that the diverse religious expressions (religions) are the result of diverse historically and culturally influenced responses to diverse perceptions of the Real. He states that \"the different religious traditions, with their complex internal differentiations, have developed to meet the needs of the range of mentalities expressed in the different human cultures.\"John Hick, God Has Many Names (PA: Westminster Press, 1980), 21.", "In several places (e.g. his contributions to The Metaphor of God Incarnate, and his book The Myth of God Incarnate) Hick proposes a reinterpretation of traditional Christology\u2014particularly the doctrine of the Incarnation.

That is, Jesus (for example) was not literally God in the flesh (incarnate), but was metaphorically speaking, the presence of God. \"Jesus was so open to divine inspiration, so responsive to the divine spirit, so obedient to God's will, that God was able to act on earth in and through him.

Dennis Ockholm and Timothy Phillips (MI: Zondervan, 1995), p.58.
