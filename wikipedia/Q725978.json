Elected representing the UK Independence Party, he became a non-inscrit one month into his term after UKIP withdrew the whip from him due to investigation into his expenses.\nA vociferous critic of fraud in the European Institutions, he himself was convicted of benefit fraud in 2007 for which he served a nine-month prison sentence and was described by the trial judge as \"a truly dishonest man\". The scandal ignited a debate as to how an MEP could receive a prison sentence, yet keep his seat in the European Parliament; there are moves afoot to review the legislation. In 2015, Mote was jailed for a further five years for fraudulently claiming nearly \u00a3500,000 in European Parliament expenses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conservative Democratic Alliance", "response": ["* Ashley Mote, then a UKIP Member of the European Parliament and author of Overcrowded Britain \u2013 Our Immigration Crisis Exposed (2004);"]}, {"page": "Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond", "response": ["* John Nyren, The Cricketers of my Time (ed.

Attempts were made to restore the ground with the result that a Hambledon v England XI fixture in 1908 appears in the generally accepted list of first-class fixtures. This was intended as a commemorative match and featured famous players C. B. Fry and Phil Mead. Hampshire cricketer Edward Whalley-Tooker, who played in the 1908 match, was a descendant of a member of the original Hambledon Club. Following the match in 1908 the ground was reclaimed for farming. Whalley-Tooker set about the task of securing its permanent use for cricket and in 1925 it was restored to host cricket matches. The possession of the land was given to Winchester College, with the college and Hambledon playing the first match there since its restoration. Whalley-Tooker led the Hambledon side to victory.alt=A Union Flag in the foreground and a cricket match with English countryside in the background|thumb|Brigands batting against Droxford CC on a Summer's Day at Broadhalfpenny Down with the Union Flag flyingIn 2000, David Underdown visited the ground while researching his history Start of Play. He wrote that \"across the road from the famous Bat and Ball pub [was] a clunky monument and a green field with a cricket pavilion, sightscreens, and a square that bore the scars of recent matches.\" A notice by the pavilion announced that it was the home ground of the Broadhalfpenny Buccaneers.Underdown, p. xv.  In this latter assertion Underdown is slightly mistaken in that the club he refers to is the Broadhalfpenny Brigands Cricket Club, formed in 1959 by a group of officers in the Royal Navy serving at nearby HMS Mercury (now closed). This club has used Broadhalfpenny Down as its home ground continuously since then. The history of Broadhalfpenny Down in the 20th century is covered in Ashley Mote's book \"The Glory Days of Cricket\", which explores the full history of the ground effectively up to the present day (apart from the addition of a new pavilion in 1999 nothing substantial has changed since the first publication of Mote's book in 1997)."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["Beldham was born in the village of Wrecclesham, on the Hampshire/Surrey border just over  south-west of Farnham.
