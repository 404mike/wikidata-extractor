The commission sat in public, and after hearing both sides, issued their report in April 1905. They stated that mutual ill-feelings made their work difficult. They concluded, however, that the Free Church was in many respects unable to carry out the purposes of the trusts, which, under the ruling of the House of Lords, was a condition of their holding the property. They recommended that an executive commission should be set up by Act of Parliament, in which the whole property of the Free Church, as at the date of the union, should be vested, and which should allocate it to the United Free Church, where the Free Church was unable to carry out the trust purposes."]}, {"page": "Sir Ralph Hugo Anstruther, 7th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ralph Anstruther"]}, {"page": "Sir Ralph Anstruther, 7th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ralph Anstruther"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (R)", "response": ["# Ralph Anstruther"]}, {"page": "Ralph Anstruther (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ralph Anstruther (1921\u20132002) was a Scottish courtier.", "Ralph Anstruther may also refer to:", "*Sir Ralph Anstruther, 4th Baronet of the Anstruther baronets", "*Sir Ralph Anstruther, 6th Baronet of the Anstruther baronets"]}, {"page": "Charles Lees (painter)", "response": ["In 1847 Lees completed his depiction of the 1844 grand match at St Andrews in an oil painting, The Golfers, which has been cited as being \"the most famous golfing work of art in the world.\" It shows the annual autumn meeting of October 1844, the scene being set at the 'Ginger Beer Hole' on the Old Course at St Andrews. The match that Lees painted was between Sir David Baird and Sir Ralph Anstruther of Balcaskie against Major Hugh Lyon Playfair of St Andrews and John Campbell, Esq. of Glensaddel. As a portrait painter Lees had painted the true likeness of the actual players and spectators, and a key survives naming them. The original oil painting is owned by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. An engraving was made by Charles E. Wagstaffe (born 1808) from which prints were produced. In 2006 the National Galleries of Scotland produced a monograph on the painting: 'The Golfers', by P. Lewis and A.
