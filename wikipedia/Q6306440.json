Roy refuses to drink with the others and spends his time working out a formula to win on the horses. He fancies betting on \"Betty's Hot Shot\". The others join him as they like the name. \"Betty's Hot Shot\" wins at 50-1, giving the men \u00a3250 each. Jack suggests they invest their winnings by buying the horse as it's a selling handicap. The trainer, Hilary Forrest (Julia Goodman), tells them the horse has tons of potential. Roy pulls out of buying the horse but the others go for it. Jack bids on their behalf, unsure about what he's doing. The men buy the horse for \u00a32,600 guineas, costing their winnings plus \u00a390 each. Hilary agrees to keep training him.
