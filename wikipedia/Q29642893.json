Carboplatin\u2019s development began in 1970 after scientists in the United States discovered that the platinum-based compound cisplatin was effective against many tumours \u2013 but had serious side-effects. A team of ICR and RMH scientists and clinicians including Professors Kenneth Harrap and Tom Connors, Hilary Calvert and Hospital Consultant Eve Wiltshaw recognised its potential but also the need for a less toxic alternative. In collaboration with the chemical and precious metal company Johnson Matthey plc the ICR scientists evaluated some 300 different platinum-containing molecules and developed a series of second-generation compounds, of which carboplatin was selected as the lead. The first clinical trial of carboplatin was carried out in 1981 and it was launched commercially as Parplatin (manufactured by Bristol-Myers) in 1986. As of 2012 carboplatin is in use for a range of cancers including ovarian and lung. For the development of these platinum-based anticancer drugs the ICR, together with The Royal Marsden Hospital and Johnson Matthey plc, received the Queen\u2019s Award for Technological Achievement in 1991."]}, {"page": "George Green's School", "response": ["* Prof Kenneth Harrap CBE, Professor of Biochemical Pharmacology from 1984 to 1997"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2017", "response": ["*Kenneth Harrap, 85, British biochemist.A pioneer of cancer drug discovery \u2013 Professor Ken Harrap 1931\u20132017"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Reginald Harrap", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Harrap"]}, {"page": "Ken Harrap", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenneth Harrap"]}]}}
