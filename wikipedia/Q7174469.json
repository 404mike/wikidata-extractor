He made his debut in the Football League on 5 September 1981 in a 3\u20130 defeat at Queens Park Rangers in the Second Division. He played in a calm and collected manner and got a good run in the side during 1981\u201382 but lost his place halfway through the following season following the arrival of Glenn Roeder and Jeff Clarke. He remained at the club, playing only infrequently, and had a spell on loan at Burnley, before leaving for Leeds United in July 1986 for a fee of \u00a345,000.During the early part of his career at Leeds he suffered a series of injuries, limiting his first-team appearances. However once he had returned he won player of the year in 1988. Under the stewardship of Howard Wilkinson \"Fish\", as he was known, became a crucial part of the defensive unit alongside Chris Fairclough that won promotion as Second Division champions in 1989\u201390. His career was cut short however when he suffered a freak injury in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 1991, as Leeds went out 3\u20131 on aggregate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cramlington", "response": ["* Peter Haddock, professional football player lived in Cramlington; most notable for playing for Leeds United, he also played for Newcastle United and Burnley"]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["During the 1986 close season, Bremner spent \u00a3125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and a further \u00a380,000 to bring in 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion."]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. players", "response": ["|1988||Peter Haddock||\u2014||\u2014||\u2014"]}, {"page": "John Kay (English footballer)", "response": ["Kay is fondly remembered by Sunderland fans for his hard tackling and determination. After one particularly tough challenge on Peter Haddock, a Leeds United player on 23 December 1990, the Leeds manager, Howard Wilkinson said that the player's leg \"looks like it's been run over by a tractor\". Kay earned the nickname \"The Tractor\" in reference to this comment. During his final game for Sunderland, against Birmingham City in 1993, Kay broke his leg and instead of writhing in pain, he sat up on the stretcher and pretended to row it off the pitch."]}]}}
