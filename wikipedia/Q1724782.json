He entered the service of the Duke of Gordon, eventually becoming the Factor to the Gordon Estate. James Hunter's The Fiddle Music of Scotland credits Marshall with writing 257 tunes. Many of these compositions were named in honor of the Duke's guests. Robert Burns called him \"the first composer of Strathspeys of the age\". He was also a clock maker, he built both a water clock and an astronomical clock and both are still in existence today.  Marshall died at Dandaleith on 29 May 1833 and was buried in Bellie Parish churchyard near Fochabers.\nSome of Marshall's best-known compositions are the strathspeys The Marchioness of Huntly, The Marquis of Huntly's Farewell, Craigellachie Brig (named after the Craigellachie Bridge), and Lady Madelina Sinclair; the air The Nameless Lassie; and the reel Easter Elchies. Marshall published two collections of his work, A Collection of Strathspey Reels with a Bass for the Violoncello or Harpsichord in 1781, and Marshall's Scottish Airs, Melodies, Strathspeys, Reels, &c. for the Piano Forte, Harp, Violin & Violoncello in 1822. A third collection, Volume 2nd of a Collection of Scottish Melodies Reels Strathspeys Jigs Slow Airs &c. for the Piano Forte, Violin and Violoncello was published posthumously in 1845. At present, his compositions are available in William Marshall's Scottish Melodies, published by Fiddlecase Books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* William Marshall (1748\u20131833)"]}, {"page": "1833 in music", "response": ["*May 29 \u2013 William Marshall, fiddler and composer (b. 1748)"]}, {"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["In the 18th century, Scottish fiddling is said to have reached new heights.

Skinner distinguished between dance tunes, which retained the staccato bowing (Laird o Drumblair), and airs which were for listening (Music of Spey). Angus Cumming produced the first collection of strathspeys to be published by a person from Strathspey. More recently, Muriel Johnstone has written some elegant piano strathspeys. These days there are at least four, some would say seven, varieties: the bouncy schottische, the strong strathspey, the song or air strathspey, all three of which can be enjoyed for dancing, and the competition strathspey for the Great Highland bagpipe, primarily intended as a display of virtuosity. Although band and solo competition bagpiping generally involves a complicated, heavily ornamented setting, traditional pipers often play simpler, more rhythmically driven versions."]}, {"page": "Fochabers", "response": ["* William Marshall (Scottish composer) (1748\u20131833), composer of Scottish fiddle music"]}, {"page": "Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon", "response": ["He was an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the music of William Marshall (1748\u20131833), a Scottish fiddler and composer, and famous for his many strathspeys, who acted as steward of the Gordon household.The Fiddler's Companion"]}, {"page": "A Red, Red Rose", "response": ["Urbani published the song to an original tune that he wrote.

He had many friends among the piping community, men who admired his approach to \"their\" tunes. Of contemporary pipers he particularly admired G. S. McLennan, Angus Mackay and William Lawrie. Yet to him the strathspey was the soul of Scots fiddling. He never played for dancing, and his approach to these tunes, which was personal, led him to use whichever tempo he felt suited to a particular melody. A favourite strathspey was \"Craigellachie Bridge\" by William Marshall (1748\u20131833), and indeed he also liked Marshall's inventive reels and, perhaps, the technical challenge that some of Marshall's music offered \u2013 once, when asked why he wrote music that was so difficult to play, Marshall answered (uncompromisingly) that he \"did not write for bunglers\"; MacAndrew enjoyed and admired this challenging music, and of all fiddle composers, it was Marshall he regarded most highly (though he also had a soft spot for Peter Milne). MacAndrew was himself a considerable composer of fiddle tunes, and a book of his tunes, 97 of them, The MacAndrew Collection, was published in 2002. His air, \"Gight Castle\", is particularly haunting. He was, however, dismissive of his efforts in this field, too much so friends, colleagues and pupils believed, and his aim, he said, was never for publication; but there is no doubt that the eventual book added a valuable addition to the library available to Scots fiddlers."]}, {"page": "1833 in Scotland", "response": ["* 29 May \u2013 William Marshall, fiddle player and composer (born 1748)"]}, {"page": "1748 in Scotland", "response": ["* 27 December \u2013 William Marshall, fiddle player and composer (died 1833)"]}, {"page": "Letterfourie House", "response": ["The reel The House of Letterfourie, also known as 'Lasses look behind you', by William Marshall of Fochabers, is named for the house."]}]}}
