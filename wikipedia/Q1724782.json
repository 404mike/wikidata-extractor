He entered the service of the Duke of Gordon, eventually becoming the Factor to the Gordon Estate. James Hunter's The Fiddle Music of Scotland credits Marshall with writing 257 tunes. Many of these compositions were named in honor of the Duke's guests. Robert Burns called him \"the first composer of Strathspeys of the age\". He was also a clock maker, he built both a water clock and an astronomical clock and both are still in existence today.  Marshall died at Dandaleith on 29 May 1833 and was buried in Bellie Parish churchyard near Fochabers.\nSome of Marshall's best-known compositions are the strathspeys The Marchioness of Huntly, The Marquis of Huntly's Farewell, Craigellachie Brig (named after the Craigellachie Bridge), and Lady Madelina Sinclair; the air The Nameless Lassie; and the reel Easter Elchies.
