His biographer Peter Lamont opines that he was one of the most famous men of his era. Harry Houdini described him as \"one of the most conspicuous and lauded of his type and generation\" and \"the forerunner of the mediums whose forte is fleecing by presuming on the credulity of the public.\" Home conducted hundreds of s\u00e9ances, which were attended by many eminent Victorians. There have been eyewitness accounts by s\u00e9ance sitters describing conjuring methods and fraud that Home may have employed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
