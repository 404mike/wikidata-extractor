He studied music at the University of Reading as an undergraduate and then at the Royal Academy of Music, London, from 1974 to 1977 as a post-graduate student. There he studied composition with Alan Bush and piano accompaniment with Geoffrey Pratley.His String Quartet No. 1 (1976) and the opera King of Macedon (1978\u201379, to a libretto by Ursula Vaughan Williams, based on a stage play by Charterhouse school pupil 1973-77 Charles Jockelson) were composed during his time as composer in residence at Charterhouse School from 1976 to 1979. Between 1980 and 1991 he was professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music. Notable works during this period include the Clarinet Quintet and the solo piano piece Equinox, a series of concertos, and the Elegy on the Death and Burial of Cock Robin (1988) for counter tenor and strings.As a pianist, Steptoe recorded the first modern performances of the Walton and Bridge piano quartets, and in the first recording of the Four Last Songs by Vaughan Williams. Anthony Bye has described Steptoe's style as \"wholeheartedly in the tradition of Vaughan Williams, Finzi, Howells, Britten and Tippett...regenerated with thoroughly contemporary means of expression\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tuba", "response": ["Concertos have been written for the tuba by many notable composers, including Ralph Vaughan Williams (Tuba Concerto), Edward Gregson, John Williams, Alexander Arutiunian, Eric Ewazen, James Barnes, Joseph Hallman, Martin Ellerby, Philip Sparke, Kalevi Aho, Josef Tal, Bruce Broughton (Tuba Concerto), John Golland, Roger Steptoe, David Carlson, Jennifer Higdon (Tuba Concerto) and Marcus Paus (Tuba Mirum)."]}, {"page": "Alan Bush", "response": ["Bush's long career as a teacher influenced generations of English composers and performers. Tippett was never a formal pupil, but has acknowledged a deep debt to Bush. Herbert Murrill, a pupil of Bush's at the RAM in the 1920s, wrote in 1950 of his tutor: \"[T]here is humility in his makeup, and I believe that no man can achieve greatness in the arts without humility ... To Alan Bush I owe much, not least the artistic strength and right to differ from him\".Murrill, p. 19 Among postwar Bush students who later led distinguished careers are the composers Edward Gregson, Roger Steptoe, E. Florence Whitlock, and Michael Nyman, and the pianists John Bingham and Graham Johnson. Through his sponsorship of the London String Quartet Bush helped launch the careers of string players such as Norbert Brainin and Emanuel Hurwitz, both of whom later achieved international recognition."]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Roger Steptoe || 1953 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for cello and orchestra", "response": ["*Roger Steptoe"]}, {"page": "List of composers for the classical guitar", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Steptoe, Roger\"| Roger Steptoe || align=center | 1953 || align=center data-sort-value=\"9999\" |  || align=center | United Kingdom || || "]}, {"page": "List of operas by composer", "response": ["*Roger Steptoe (1953\u2013 ): King of Macedon (opera)"]}, {"page": "Cristal Baschet", "response": ["Among the composers are Fran\u00e7ois Bayle, Michel Deneuve, Luc Ferrari, Guy Reibel, Jacques Lasry, Bernard Baschet, Etienne Rolin, Toru Takemitsu, Jean Michel Jarre, Cliff Martinez, Beatriz Ferreyra, Michel Redolfi, Damon Albarn / Gorillaz, Tom Waits, Philippe Sarde, Jean-Michel Hasler, Jean-Michel Calvin, Horatiu Radulescu, Bruno Giner, Richard Hawley, Johan S\u00f6derqvist, Eric Fischer, Emmanuel S\u00e9journ\u00e9, Roger Steptoe, Alain Voirpy and others."]}, {"page": "Oboe concerto", "response": ["*Roger Steptoe"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for viola: S", "response": ["* Roger Steptoe (b. 1953)"]}, {"page": "Lionel Tertis International Viola Competition", "response": ["* 2010 \u2013 Petite Sonatine 1 for viola solo (2009) by Roger Steptoe; published by Editions BIM Roger Steptoe website"]}, {"page": "New London Orchestra", "response": ["In 1995 at St. John's, Smith Square it gave a series of concerts called 'London Firsts', each of which included London premi\u00e8res of works such as Rodrigo's Tres Viejos Aires de Danza (16 March), Anton\u00edn Tu\u010dapsk\u00fd's Violin Concerto, Roger Steptoe's Flute Concerto (18 May), Naji Hakim's Saul of Tarsus (29 June), Malcolm Arnold's Recorder Concerto (2 December) and the world concert premi\u00e8re of Frederick Delius's Idylle de Printemps (2 November)."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the Royal Academy of Music", "response": ["* Roger Steptoe (pianist)"]}, {"page": "Steptoe", "response": ["*Roger Steptoe (born 1953), English composer and pianist"]}]}}
