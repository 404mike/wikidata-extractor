In 1836 he moved to London, where he worked with the Earl of Munster on the latter's Geschichte der Kriegswissenschaften bei den mohammedanischen V\u00f6lkern, \u2018History of Military Science among the Muslim Peoples\u2019, and thence in 1843 to Calcutta, where he became principal of Delhi College. In this capacity he had many textbooks translated into Hindustani from European languages.\nIn 1848 he was sent to Lucknow, to prepare a catalogue of the royal library there, the first volume of which appeared in Calcutta in 1854. This book, with its lists of Persian poets, its careful description of all the chief works of Persian poetry and its valuable biographical material, became a worthy guide for the exploration of Persian literature.\nIn 1850 Sprenger was named examiner, official government interpreter, and secretary of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. He published many works while holding this latter position, among them \u201cDictionary of the Technical terms used in the sciences of the Musulmans\u201d (1854) and \u201cIbn Hajar's biographical dictionary of persons who knew Mohammed\u201d (1856).\nSprenger took a position as professor of oriental languages at the University of Bern in 1857, moving in 1881 to Heidelberg. His voluminous collection of Arabic, Persian, Hindustani and other manuscripts and printed material was eventually acquired by the Berlin State Library.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani", "response": ["His Geography of the Arabian Peninsula (Sifat Jazirat ul-Arab) is by far the most important work on the subject.

Weil purposed to give a philologically exact version, which would have been highly desirable in many respects; but the Stuttgart publisher authorized August Lewald to change many objectionable passages, and thus made of it a popular and salable work. This perversion caused Weil much vexation. Weil's second great work was Mohammed, der Prophet (Stuttgart, 1843), a life of Mohammed.in the compilation of which he was the first to go back to the oldest accessible sources in Europe.
