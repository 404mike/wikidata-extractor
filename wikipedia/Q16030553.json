She began writing at eighteen, and from the small profits of stories and magazine articles saved enough to visit Italy, a cherished ambition. There she met and in 1867 married Samuel Thomas Baxter (1810\u20131903), a member of a family long settled in Florence, which then became her home. For thirty-five years she was a well-known figure in the literary and artistic life of the city, and in 1882 was elected an honorary member of the Accademia delle Belle Arti. For thirteen years her residence was the Villa Bianca, outside Florence, in the direction of Vincigliata (near Fiesole) and Settignano. Among those with whom she was associated in literary research was John Temple Leader, a wealthy English resident at Florence, who owned the castle of Vincigliata. Her literary pseudonym of \u2018Leader Scott\u2019 combined the maiden surnames of her two grandmothers, Isabel Leader being her mother\u2019s mother and Grace Scott the mother of her father.\n\nHer principal publication was The Cathedral Builders (1899 and 1900), an important examination of the whole field of Romanesque architecture in relation to the Comacine masons. Her biographer for the DNB observed that: though necessarily based on Merzario\u2019s I Maestri Comacini, the book shows much original observation and research and, if its arguments are not always conclusive, the international scope of the work and its wealth of illustration render it a storehouse of information and a useful introduction to an unfrequented field of speculation. The intention of the work was to attribute the entire genesis of mediaeval architecture to masonic guilds derived, so it is supposed, from the Roman Collegia.\nApart from this work and numerous magazine articles, she published: \n\nA Nook in the Apennines, 1879.\nFra Bartolommeo and Andrea del Sarto, 1881.\nGhiberti and Donatello, 1882\nLuca della Robbia, 1883\nMesser Agnolo\u2019s Household, 1883.\nRenaissance of Art in Italy, 1883\nA Bunch of Berries, Bungay, 1885\nSculpture, Renaissance and Modern, 1886\nLife of William Barnes, 1887\nTuscan Studies and Sketches, 1887\nVincigliata and Maiano, Florence and London, 1891\nThe Orti Oricellari, Florence, 1893\nEchoes of Old Florence, Florence and London, 1894\nThe Castle of Vincigliata, Florence, 1897\nThe Renunciation of Helen, 1898\n Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, 1901\nCorreggio, 1902.She translated from Italian:\n\nSir John Hawkwood by John Temple Leader and G.
