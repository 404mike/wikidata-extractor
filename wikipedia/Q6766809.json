These pictures - highly accurate painted casts that operate somewhere between painting and sculpture - involve the meticulous re-creation of randomly chosen areas of the Earth's surface using resin and fibreglass (as well as real materials from the site) and have been exhibited internationally. Past shows have included the British Pavilion at the XXXIX Venice Biennale in 1978, Beyond Image - Boyle Family (Hayward Gallery, London) in 1986 and Boyle Family (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh) - a major retrospective held in 2003.In addition to developing highly original casting techniques, Mark Boyle and Joan Hills also pioneered the use of liquid light shows during the 1960s. These projections played a seminal role in the development of the counter-culture of the period. The light environments were used to accompany stage performances by such artists as Jimi Hendrix and jazz-rock pioneers Soft Machine.\nAmongst others he collaborated with George Brecht, Peter Schmidt (artist), Cornelius Cardew, and John Tilbury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boyle", "response": ["*Mark Boyle (disambiguation), multiple people", "*Mark Boyle (1934\u20132005), Scottish artist", "*Mark Boyle (snooker player) (born 1981), Scottish snooker player"]}, {"page": "List of pin-up artists", "response": ["* Mark Boyle"]}, {"page": "UFO Club", "response": ["* 17 Feb: Soft Machine; Indian Music; Disney Cartoons; Mark Boyle Projections; Feature Movie; 'erogenius 3 + 4'", "* 29 Sep: Jeff Beck; Ten Years After; Mark Boyle's New Sensual Laboratory; Contessa Veronica"]}, {"page": "Psychedelic art", "response": ["* Mark Boyle and Joan Hills"]}, {"page": "Tom Adams (illustrator)", "response": ["In the 1960s and 1970s he became involved with several distinguished poets, including Edward Lucie-Smith, Ted Hughes, C.

On his return to England, he painted directly from objects and people, mainly in oils. His work was exhibited at Beaux Arts, with his first one-man show in 1961. He was the subject of a film called CUBISM AND BEYOND: DEPARTURES made for BBC TV in 1961. In 1963 he began a concept of painting he called PROGRAM. He produced a series of works inspired by music exhibited in a one-man show at the Curwen Gallery 1966. By this time his work had become totally abstract and he was focusing on ideas and systems. He performed an electronic music event called A PAINTERS USE OF SOUND at the ICA in 1967. Other music and performance work were at the Bristol Arts Centre, the UFO Club and, the Cochrane Theatre. He was also working with Mark Boyle at that time, performing in \"Son et Lumiere\" also at the Cochrane.
