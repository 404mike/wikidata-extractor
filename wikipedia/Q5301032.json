A leg-spinner for Kent and England from 1932 to 1957 he took a record seven hat-tricks in first-class cricket. He played for Kent for 19 seasons and was their first professional captain from late 1953 to 1956. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he had seen apart from Bill O'Reilly. He toured Australia in 1946\u201347 and 1950\u201351, but was dogged by ill-luck and was considered to be the \"unluckiest bowler in the world\".\n\nCutting a leg-break is always dangerous, and cutting Wright is a form of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked tendency to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing-line.\nJohnnie Moyes", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 21", "response": ["*1914 \u2013 Doug Wright, English cricketer and coach (d. 1998)"]}, {"page": "Sidcup", "response": ["* Doug Wright (1914\u201398), cricketer (Kent and England), born in Sidcup"]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["Ramadhin was forced to bowl a heart-breaking 98\u201335\u2013179\u20132, the most overs by a bowler in a first-class innings and was never the same force again.
