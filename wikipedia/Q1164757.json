After a goalless first half in which Birmingham's Marcelo hit the Preston crossbar, Nicky Eaden put the home side ahead in the 54th minute.  David Healy's strike 20 minutes later was saved by Ian Bennett in Birmingham's goal, while Darren Purse's late header went wide from  ensuring  the game ended 1\u20130 to Birmingham.

Five minutes into the second half, Danny Sonner's header struck the home side's crossbar and in the 59th minute, Geoff Horsfield gave Birmingham the lead overall when he converted a cross from Stan Lazaridis at the far post. Preston were awarded a penalty in the 78th minute after a Sonner handball, but Graham Alexander's spot-kick hit the bar.  A late shot from Lazaridis rolled along Preston's goal line before Birmingham conceded an injury-time goal from Mark Rankine to make it 2\u20132 on aggregate and send the match into extra time.  No goals were scored during the additional period, so a penalty shootout decided the match:  Marcelo and Purse both missed their spot-kicks for Birmingham and although Preston's Rob Edwards saw his effort also go awry, Paul McKenna's converted shot ensured Preston won the shootout 4\u20132 to progress to the final."]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["* LM: #32,  Danny Sonner, 26", "|Danny Sonner"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["|7||MF||Danny Sonner||4||1||1||0||0||0||5||1"]}, {"page": "Daniel James Sonner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Danny Sonner"]}, {"page": "Daniel Sonner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Danny Sonner"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wigan", "response": ["*Danny Sonner, Wigan-born association football player who has represented Northern Ireland national football team Retrieved on 8 December 2008."]}, {"page": "List of Nottingham Forest F.C. internationals", "response": ["*Danny Sonner"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season started positively with ten points from five games, though until the end of the season Vale failed to find form, and picked up an average of one point a game despite only playing in five draws all season.

Foyle brought a new signing to Vale Park though, with striker Nathan Lowndes joining on a free transfer from Plymouth Argyle.

Christian Hanson was also signed from non-league Billingham Synthonia. Foyle also signed Nigerian defender George Abbey, who had been released by Macclesfield Town. In January, Dean Smith retired as a player and took up coaching at Leyton Orient. As a replacement, former Vale player Tommy Widdrington joined until the end of the season on non-contract terms. In February, veteran midfielder Danny Sonner joined on a one-month loan from Peterborough United. In March, club legend and former teammate of Foyle, Tony Naylor, joined on an emergency short-term contract, though never took to the field. Tony Dinning also was signed on loan from Bristol City.
