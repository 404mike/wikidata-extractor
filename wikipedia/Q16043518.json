Grace as being \"exceedingly difficult to play.\". In his Wisden obituary, it was reported that \"the majority of experts having no hesitation in describing him as a rank thrower.\" Grace was scarcely kinder, noting that he was \"inclined to think that he ought to have been no-balled in every over.\" Despite the widespread opinion against his action, the umpires, themselves professional, were reluctant to no-ball him.. There was a feeling in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that \"no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [to signify] their disapproval of it.\" As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he was considered a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51. Throwing in cricket came to a head in the early part of the twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close, most notably those of Lancashire's Arthur Mold, Somerset's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire's Frederic Geeson.."]}, {"page": "John Joyce (cricketer)", "response": ["Joyce made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1894.
