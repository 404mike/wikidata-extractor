Rufus Hound voices the new incarnation who has disguised himself as constable Pavo, a member of a special Gallifreyan police unit called Chapter 9. The Monk's plan involves helping an alien race called the Seeth escape from their pocket universe 200 years early, whilst receiving payment to offset the expensive overheads associated with fixing time. The Monk is last seen being sucked into the pocket universe, along with the Seeth, while the Doctor's memory of these events is erased by the real Pavo. The same incarnation is heard again in the Big Finish Short Trips adventures The Blame Game and How to Win Planets and Influence People, as an adversary of the Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor respectively. He also appears alongside the Eighth Doctor in The Side of the Angels, the third adventure in the fourth Doom Coalition boxset, where he represents a group of Time Lords working with Weeping Angels to prepare an enclave in 1970s New York to protect them from the imminent destruction of the universe, only to be betrayed by the Angels and banished centuries into the past. The Hound incarnation makes a further appearance in The Rise of the New Humans, where he acts as the chief administrator of an clinic using future technology and resources to treat diseases.", "The Rufus Hound incarnation of the Monk makes an appearance in the series Missy, starring Michelle Gomez as the Missy incarnation of the Master. In \"Divorced, Beheaded, Regenerated\", the Monk is stranded on Earth and, disguised as Henry VIII, meddles with history in order to attract the attention of the Time Lords. He attracts the attention of Missy instead who is herself searching for a time traveller in order to steal their equipment. Missy escapes with a piece of the Monk's TARDIS, with the Monk vowing revenge. The Monk makes a second appearance in \"Too Many Masters\" where he enacts his revenge by abducting Missy. Meanwhile, the Ogrons are searching for the Master as he had stiffed them on their payment when they were working for him. They detect the Monk's TARDIS and track it, capturing the Monk and Missy. They both escape in the Monk's TARDIS as neither can operate it without the other because of their manipulation of its security features.", "The Monk has made several appearances in audio stories produced by Big Finish with the role being played at various times by Graeme Garden, Rufus Hound and Gemma Whelan. Other actors have taken on the role when the Monk is in disguise. The order of the Monk's incarnations is left intentionally unclear during their appearances, with the character suggesting that meddling with time has rewritten their existence so often that even they don't know which order they exist in."]}, {"page": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts", "response": ["Between 2009 and 2019, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, London, and have been hosted by Dara \u00d3 Briain and Rufus Hound.

The second series introduced a character known as The Lumiat \u2013 revealed to be the next incarnation of The Master, the immediate successor to Missy \u2013 played by Gina McKee. It is explained that, after her \"poetic\" death at the hands of her predecessor, Missy used an Elysian field to transfer her consciousness into a duplicate body created from her own dying cells and trigger regeneration. Motivated by her recent attempt at redemption, she edited the duplicate to remove all the negative aspects of her personality and became a benevolent force in the universe, adopting the title Lumiat. Missy encounters the Lumiat trying to undo some of her earlier incarnation's evil deeds. Sickened by her future self, Missy kills the Lumiat with a TCE and abandons her to regenerate, implying the process might cause them to return to evil.
