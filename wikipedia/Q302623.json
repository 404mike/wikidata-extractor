His final match was at the 1997 Benson & Hedges Masters final when Steve Davis defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 10\u20138 after trailing 4\u20138. This match was particularly notable for having a streaker run around the table leaving John Street speechless.\nStreet refereed in five World Championship finals between 1980 and 1995. He handled the famous 1992 final between Jimmy White and Stephen Hendry when Hendry came from 8\u201314 behind to win the match 18\u201314 by winning 10 consecutive frames.\nStreet was co-author of several snooker rule books.\nHe died from lung disease in Exeter in 2009 aged 77. Street was married to Jean, they had two children together.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Street", "response": ["John Street may refer to:", "*John Street (footballer, born 1926), English footballer for Liverpool, Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham United who played as a goalkeeper", "* John Street (Australian politician) (1832\u20131891), Australian member of parliament for East Sydney", "* John Street (snooker referee) (1932\u20132009), British snooker referee", "* Cecil John Charles Street (1884-1964), also known as John Street, British soldier and novelist", "* John Street (Toronto)", "* John Street (Markham), Ontario", "* John Street (Hamilton, Ontario)", "* John Street, part of Ontario Highway 136", "* John Street (Manhattan), New York", "*170-176 John Street Building, historic building in New York", "*116 John Street, historic building in New York", "*John Street Theatre, New York", "*John Street Methodist Church, Manhattan", "*John Street House, historic building in Ohio", "*John Street Roundhouse, preserved railway roundhouse in Ontario"]}, {"page": "1997 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["* Alan Chamberlain refereed his first and only World Championship final.
