That summer he signed Dave Bewley, Roy Brown and Maurice Cook, all of whom went on to play key roles during his reign. After guiding Watford to 4th and 7th in the next two campaigns, Goulden stepped down to become a coach midway through the 1955\u201356 season. However, his successor and former player Johnny Paton's spell yielded just 2 wins from 15 games, including defeat at the hands of non-league clubs Aldershot and Bedford Town. Goulden took over for the remainder of the season, but was only able to salvage a 21st-placed finish."]}, {"page": "2013 in association football", "response": ["* March 6 \u2013 Dave Bewley, English footballer (92)"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 in English football", "response": ["* 6 March 2013: Dave Bewley, 92, former Fulham, Reading and Watford full back."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Dave Bewley, 82, footballer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2013", "response": ["*Dave Bewley, 92, English footballer (Watford).Watford's oldest known player passes away|Watford Observer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bournemouth", "response": ["* Dave Bewley (1920\u20132013) professional footballer, made 141 pro appearances"]}]}}
