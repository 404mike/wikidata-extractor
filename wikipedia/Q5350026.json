Elizabeth Price left toward the end of the year to form The Carousel with Razorcuts frontman Gregory Webster, and so the single, released on 30 May 1987, was the first to feature replacement Eithne Farry (vocals, tambourine). The single was less shambolic than their earlier offerings, and a video was made for it which was played on The Chart Show (then shown on Channel 4), giving the band some mainstream exposure. The single was produced (some critics suggested it was over-produced) by John Rivers, as was the follow-up \"Bringing Up Baby\", a sophisticated pop song that reduced the band's \"shambling\" element to the point where mainstream success seemed a possibility. Indeed, The Primitives would later take precisely this route to success \u2013 but Talulah Gosh never made the national chart. The ironically-titled debut (compilation) album Rock Legends: Volume 69 was released in October 1987, collecting tracks from the earlier singles and radio sessions.", "January 1988 saw not only the release of \"Bringing Up Baby\" but also the broadcast of a second Radio 1 session, this time for DJ John Peel. What was to be Talulah Gosh's last single, a punk thrash titled \"Testcard Girl\" (very loosely based on an old Heinz advertising jingle), was released in May. The group split later that year.  A posthumous collection of BBC radio sessions was issued by Sarah Records in 1991, and a more comprehensive retrospective was released on K Records in 1996. A limited edition EP of demos, recorded in 1986, was issued for Record Store Day in 2011, at which point a new retrospective album was also announced, at that time to be called Grrrr. On 22 July 2013, Amelia Fletcher announced on her Facebook page that the album, now called Was It Just a Dream?, would be released in October 2013. It was launched along with a DJ set by Amelia Fletcher, Eithne Farry and Elizabeth Price at the London club Scared To Dance."]}, {"page": "Farry", "response": ["* Eithne Farry, British editor"]}, {"page": "Rowan Hisayo Buchanan", "response": ["Buchanan's second novel, Starling Days, was published by Sceptre in 2019. It is about Mina and Oscar, newly-weds who have moved from New York to London in hopes that a change of scenery and new friends will help Mina recover from a major depressive episode. The novel was selected by The Paris Review as a \"Staff Pick\" for being \"an exquisite rendering of love, sadness, and misunderstanding.\" Starling Days was positively reviewed by Eithne Farry in the Sunday Express, and The Spectator described it as \"a convincing novel about depression which manages, miraculously, not to be in itself depressing.\" In The Guardian, Molly McCloskey criticized the novel's writing, particularly its unconvincing use of a feminist viewpoint, while also noting that Starling Days contained \"indications that Buchanan is a better writer than this work would suggest\" and concluding that the book \"offers consolation\" to readers. The book was shortlisted for the 2019 Costa Book Awards in the Novel category."]}]}}
