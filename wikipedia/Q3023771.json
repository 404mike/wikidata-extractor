He was occasionally rested in friendly matches so that coaches Ron Greenwood and then Bobby Robson could check on potential replacements Derek Statham, Alan Kennedy, Nick Pickering and Stuart Pearce in the event of Sansom's suffering from either serious injury or chronic loss of form. However Sansom was still the regular left-back during England's UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying campaign."]}, {"page": "FA Youth Cup", "response": ["| Derek Statham"]}, {"page": "Statham", "response": ["* Derek Statham, English football player"]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["His return to First Division football came in March 1989 when Southampton offered Leeds \u00a3250,000 for his services.

Adams retained his place for the next seven games, before losing out to Gerry Forrest for the last few matches of the season. Adams played the first seven matches of the 1989\u201390 season before losing his place through injury to Francis Benali, who then began to form a useful full-back partnership with Jason Dodd. In April 1990, Adams was recalled alongside new signing Oleksiy Cherednyk and they played out the remainder of the season together."]}, {"page": "Mick Mills", "response": ["The 1987\u201388 season was a frustrating one for Stoke as little progress was made a poor position of 11th was the outcome with Dixon and Steve Bould both being sold to Arsenal. The 1988\u201389 season again saw Stoke finish in mid-table which prompted speculation that Mills would not be offered a new contract. In the end he was given a 'final chance' to get Stoke promoted and he was given a \u00a31 million transfer budget by Coates for the 1989\u201390 season. He spent it all breaking the club's record transfer of \u00a3480,000 for Sheffield Wednesday defender Ian Cranson, \u00a375,000 on Derek Statham from West Bromwich Albion, \u00a3175,000 for Ian Scott and \u00a3250,000 for Wayne Biggins both from Manchester City.
