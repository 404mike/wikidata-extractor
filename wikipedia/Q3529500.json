He was born in Rhodesia, and as a young man played international cricket for Zimbabwe. He played English county cricket for Worcestershire for his entire English domestic career, a period of well over twenty years, and in 2008 surpassed Graham Gooch's record for the most matches in all forms of the game combined.He scored more than 40,000 first-class runs, mostly from number three in the order, and he is one of only three players to have passed 20,000 runs in List A cricket (Graham Gooch and Sachin Tendulkar are the others) and is one of only twenty-five players to have scored 100 centuries in first-class cricket. He is the only cricketer who scored first-class triple hundreds in three different decades (1988, 1997 and 2002). He is the second highest run scorer of all time after Graham Gooch. Despite these achievements, he is commonly held to have underachieved in international cricket, a view based on comparison of Hick's overall first-class batting average of 52.23 vis-\u00e0-vis his Test average of 31.32.\nAt one time Hick's bowling was a significant force, and his off-spin claimed more than 200 first-class wickets. However, after 2001 he rarely bowled, and took only one first-class and two List A wickets; indeed, after the 2004 season he did not bowl a single ball in either form of the game. Throughout his career he was an outstanding slip fielder: Gooch wrote in his autobiography that his ideal slip cordon would comprise Mark Taylor, Ian Botham and Hick.Hick was granted a benefit season by Worcestershire in 1999, which raised over \u00a3345,000;\nhe was also awarded a testimonial in 2006. Hick retired from county cricket at the end of the 2008 season, to take up a coaching post at Malvern College. For the remaining part of the season, he joined Chandigarh Lions of the Indian Cricket League.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 23", "response": ["*1966 \u2013 Graeme Hick, Zimbabwean-English cricketer and coach"]}, {"page": "1966", "response": ["** Graeme Hick, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Curtly Ambrose", "response": ["West Indies' next matches were in England. The Test series was drawn 2\u20132 and Ambrose was the team's leading wicket-taker with 28 (averaging 20.00); he also came top of the bowling averages.Berry (1992), pp. 297\u201398. He had a particular impact on Graeme Hick, who was appearing in Test cricket for the first time, dismissing him six times in seven innings with short-pitched bowling. Accurate bowling was important in the series, played on a series of slow-paced pitches; according to Scyld Berry, writing in Wisden, \"Since the 1988 tour, Ambrose had improved his control to the point where a batsman had to play almost every ball\u2014and not with a scoring stroke, either\".Berry (1992), p. 294. Berry suggests that West Indies may have won the series had Viv Richards used a different tactical approach with Ambrose's bowling. The bowler was not fully fit in the final Test, which may have affected the outcome. Berry describes \"Ambrose's rise to the status of a giant\u2014with the mannerism of celebrating each wicket by whirling his arms upwards, like a flock of doves taking to the air.\" Ambrose twice took five wickets in an innings\u2014his best figures were six for 52 in the first Test, when he twice took wickets with consecutive deliveries.Callaghan, John in Berry (1992), pp. 309. Ambrose was named man-of the-match in the third Test and adjudged West Indies man-of-the-series.Berry (1992), pp. 317, 328. For his performances, Ambrose was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation remarked on his consistency and stated: \"Ambrose has the ability to exert a debilitating psychological influence which so often precipitates a cluster of wickets after the initial breach has been made\u00a0... Moreover, he was arguably the essential difference between the two sides in what proved to be a zestful series.\" The West Indies wicket-keeper, Jeff Dujon, said: \"He is mature beyond his years, has pace, accuracy, heart and determination, plus, importantly, real pride in economical figures.\""]}, {"page": "Rahul Dravid", "response": ["Dravid warmed up for his debut World Cup with two fifties in the 1998\u201399 Coca-Cola Cup in Sharjah, one each against England and Pakistan.

He first stumped Graeme Hick off Sunil Joshi's bowling, who became Dravid's first victim as a wicket-keeper, and then caught Neil Fairbrother off Ajay Jadeja's bowling.

He was dropped from the team, as the selectors favoured other openers, initially Taylor and Matthew Elliott, then later Slater and Greg Blewett, for the next few years.

In that year's County Championship, he placed third in the overall averages (behind teammate Steve Waugh and Northamptonshire's Roger Harper), and also placed third for overall runs scored (behind Graeme Hick and Graeme Fowler). Against Hampshire in the 1987 Benson & Hedges Cup (a limited-overs competition), he scored 155 not out from 119 balls, which was the highest one-day score of his career.
