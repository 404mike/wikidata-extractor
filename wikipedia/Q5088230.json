According to Captain Chauncey Hugh Stigand and his version of the Pate Chronicles, the history of Shanga began with the arrival of Sulaiman ibn Sulaiman ibn Muzaffar al-Nabhan in 600 AD. It is stated that Sulaiman married the daughter of the king of Pate, thus giving him authority to rule over part of the island. Shanga was an independent town at the time of this event, so it did not fall under Sulaiman\u2019s jurisdiction. It was Sulaiman\u2019s royal descendants, however, that were eventually responsible for conquering Shanga later on."]}, {"page": "W.

Serving in Burma, British Somaliland, British East Africa and the Sudan, Stigand was a keen big game hunter who took greater risks than most hunters and often came close to being fatally injured. Stigand was gored in the chest by a rhino, mauled by a wounded lion that he was following up in the dark, tusked through the leg by an elephant that he was trying to drive out of a garden (without a rifle) and was knocked to the ground by another wounded elephant which stood over him bleeding whilst he lay hidden. Stigand once crawled into a cave after another wounded lion which, luckily for him, had died by the time he reached it. Stigand wrote several books including Hunting the elephant in Africa and The game of British East Africa, he usually used a .256 Mannlicher for elephants, rhinoceros, lion, buffalo and smaller game, he also used an old big bore .450 Nitro Express double rifle which he usually had a gun bearer carry for him."]}, {"page": "Chauncey (name)", "response": ["*Chauncey Hugh Stigand (1877\u20131919), British army officer"]}, {"page": "Marchuwa", "response": ["Marchuwa (Ge\u02bdez: \u121b\u122d\u132f, Wolaytta: Mariccuwaa) is a currency used by Kingdom of Wolayta.
