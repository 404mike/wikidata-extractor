This version was of necessity heavily edited, ultimately losing of half the overall content, because, as Brooke noted in his introduction: \"... a number of the omitted passages, though not legally actionable, might well cause offence or embarrassment to the persons concerned...\"Brooke (1952) p. xiv As Phillips adds, \"[t]his is the risk one runs... in publishing the diary of a man just dead.\"Phillips (1974) p. 147 Of what is included, almost all the names of people not in Welch's immediate circle are redacted; Edith Sitwell is a notable exception.Brooke (1952) p. 4Brooke had apparently intended to follow this publication with a volume of Welch's letters, as a letter in The Times Literary Supplement of 15 May 1953 indicates. According to John Russell Taylor in a December 1984 review of the revised journals in The Times, the \"upset\" caused by Brooke's edition caused it to be dropped, and to date a volume of Welch's collected letters is yet to be published.", "The third edition of 1984 was prompted by the discovery of additional material by the actor Benjamin Whitrow.De-la-Noy (1984a) p. xi Whitrow had been corresponding with one of Welch's friends, Francis Streeten. After Streeten's death, Whitrow found amongst his belongings Brooke's typescript working copy of the journals,In his 1988 biography of Edward Sackville-West, Michael De-la-Noy suggests that Eric Oliver had originally entrusted editorship of the journals to Streeten; one to whom, in De-la-Noy's words, \"it would have been rash to trust with a shopping list.\" (, p. 242). In a letter to Brooke, Sackville-West referred to Oliver as a \"seedy nobody\". and these he used to uncover (in some cases decipher) the material Brooke had excised.Whitrow, Benjamin (2013) \"Feverish Haste\", Slightly Foxed 38,  This new edition completely revised the content, replacing all the redacted names, and expanding Brooke's edition by some 75,000 wordsDe-la-Noy (1984a) p. x but not including the longer prose passages and some of the poetry (published in A Last Sheaf), and novel fragment (published as I Left My Grandfather's House in 1958).The 1984 edition is not completely unexpurgated, however. De-la-Noy states in the introduction that \"two very minor cuts have been made on the grounds of libel\" with a further excision of \"gratuitous gossip.\" (1984a, p. x) However, reviewingHollinghurst, Alan (1984) \"Diminished Pictures\", Times Literary Supplement, December 21 1984, p. 1479-80 this edition, the writer Alan Hollinghurst expressed reservations about its veracity: finding errors in the extracts De-la-Noy quoted from the Journals in his biography, Hollinghurst wondered which ones were the misprints.Hollinghurst found over seventy inconsistences: as an example, in the 1984 edition of the Journals, Welch identifies his partner's aunt as \"...delicate and gentle\" (De-la-Noy (1984a) p. 167) whereas in the biography this is quoted as \"...delicate and genteel\" (De-la-Noy (1984b), p. 236)Jean-Louis Chevalier's overview of the Denton Welch papers at the University of Texas at Austin for the Texas Quarterly, Summer 1972, quotes a handful of passages from the journals which Brooke did not use. Even here there are inconsistencies with the 1984 publication. For instance, \"golden brown\" becomes \"gold brown\" in the 1984 edition, \"verandah\" becomes \"veranda\", \"all those fifty years ago\" becomes \"all those years ago\". These errors are all in a single journal entry and on one page. Even more critically, an entry for January 4 1944 states: \"... I thought how many times I had sat in tea-shops and restaurants alone, listening to others talking, watching them, fitting into their lives, then watching them walk out of the door and away for ever.\" (p. 12). In the 1984 edition, De-la-Noy omits a comma, and in so doing changes the meaning: \"... watching them fitting in to their lives, then watching them walk out of the door...\" (1984a, p. 180). In his notes to his 2002 biography, James Methuen-Campbell identifies several other misprints or misreadings present in the 1984 edition.The tale of how the 1984 edition came into being is particularly labyrinthine: after Welch's death, his friend Helen Roeder transcribed the journals into a typewritten copy, almost certainly making errors in the process. Jocelyn Brooke used this transcription for his 1952 edition (and it appears he physically cut and pasted Roeder's work to achieve this). This heavily-edited document passed (possibly back - see note 15 above) into the hands of Francis Streeten, and thence to Benjamin Whitrow, who attempted to reconstruct the original material from what remained. De-la-Noy used this as the basis for his edition, stating that it \"saved me hours of routine work\" (1984a, p. xi), presumably meaning the work of verifying its accuracy with the originals in Texas."]}, {"page": "Brave and Cruel", "response": ["The short story \"Brave and Cruel\" concerns a wayward, charismatic character called Micki Beaumont, and his arrival into the lives of a group of middle-class friends. In particular, the story focuses on his relationship with the daughter of one of them, which appears to be leading to a deeply ill-advised marriage. Hamilton's concern stemmed from the fact that, as with almost all of Welch's stories, it was based on an actual event, and a recent one at that. Welch had, in fact, recorded most of what would become the structure of the story in his journal for August and September 1943.Jocelyn Brooke omitted the entries in the 1952 edition of the Journals, but they do appear in Michael De-la-Noy's edition of 1984 (, pp. 99--108) However, after asking Welch to make a few minor textual changes, Hamilton was satisfied the story was not actionable, despite the fact that some of the characters' actions appear gullible and foolish.Methuen-Campbell (2002) p. 189"]}, {"page": "Dumb Instrument", "response": ["Despite this modest success, he noted in his journal, \"I keep on wondering if I'm producing semi-demi A.

Wilson Harris, London: Hamish Hamilton, p. 75) and Jocelyn Brooke, who edited the first edition of The Denton Welch Journals in 1952."]}]}}
