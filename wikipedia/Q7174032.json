An essay by British researcher Peter Foote for the Saga Book of the Viking Society (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher  (1874-1951) had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly trying to track Jeli\u0107's phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jeli\u0107 had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that he never mentioned any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jeli\u0107's work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept from the work of earlier researchers, listed by Jeli\u0107, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase \"\u00e9v\u00e8que r\u00e9gionnaire des contr\u00e9es am\u00e9ricaines\" into Latin."]}, {"page": "Battle of Svolder", "response": ["* Theodoricus monachus (translated and annotated by David and Ian McDougall with an introduction by Peter Foote) (1998).
