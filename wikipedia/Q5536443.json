To this end the stockade fence on the south side was re-erected  nearer the Reformatory, arrow-headed demi-bastions were formed at the northeast and southwest corners, a ditch was constructed around the fortifications, the trees in front of the redoubt were cleared, a telegraph line was installed from Signal Hill to Fort Lytton below, and ordnance were ordered. In much of this work, the Reformatory boys assisted. By 1887 the Redoubt had been completed, its armament had arrived (although never mounted in position), and French recommended that the Reformatory now be removed. Finally in 1899, just prior to Federation, tenders were called for the removal of the Reformatory buildings from Lytton and their re-erection, with additions, at Westbrook near Toowoomba."]}, {"page": "1917 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Colonel George Arthur French"]}, {"page": "1877 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Captain George Arthur French  formerly Commissioner of the North-West Police, Canada"]}]}}
