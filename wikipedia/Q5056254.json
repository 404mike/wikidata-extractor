Unusually, he played for two counties in the same season: his Worcestershire appearance came against Oxford University in 1904, in which year he later played three County Championship matches for Hampshire. In the game against Oxford he made his highest score, 75 not out.\nPalmer made his debut for Hampshire against Sussex at Hove in July 1899, scoring 16 and 1. In his other appearance that summer, against Yorkshire at Bradford, he made 64, the first of his two half-centuries. He then did not play again until 1901, when in four innings he totalled just eight runs, and after that there was another gap until the above-mentioned 1904 season. After that year, he was to play just one more game, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in July 1907.\nAs a soldier, Palmer was mentioned in despatches in the Second Boer War. In the First World War he was in the 9th Royal Warwickshire Regiment, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was killed in action at the Gallipoli campaign, aged 42.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "J. Thomas Looney", "response": ["After the failure of the Comtean church, Looney devoted himself to research into the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. He developed his theory during World War I,  depositing his claim to priority in a sealed document at the British Museum in 1918. In 1920 he published his work, whose short title is Shakespeare Identified, through Cecil Palmer in London. Looney, who resisted his publisher's suggestion that he use a pseudonym,Schoenbaum, S. (1991), Shakespeare's Lives, 2nd ed., Clarendon, p.\u00a0430. argued that the real author of Shakespeare's plays was Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who fitted Looney's deductions that Shakespeare was, among much else, a nobleman of Lancastrian sympathies, with a fondness for Italy and a leaning towards Catholicism. Looney believed his argument followed the systematic methods prescribed by Positivism."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Cecil Palmer"]}]}}
