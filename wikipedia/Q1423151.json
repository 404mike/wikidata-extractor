His dissertation was titled Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie (On Questions of Method in the Psychology of Thinking). In 1929, he obtained an authorisation to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school, and began doing so. He married his colleague Josefine Anna Henninger (1906\u20131985) in 1930. Fearing the rise of Nazism and the threat of the Anschluss, he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie (The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge). He needed to publish a book to get an academic position in a country that was safe for people of Jewish descent. In the end, he did not publish the two-volume work; but instead, a condensed version with some new material, as Logik der Forschung (The Logic of Scientific Discovery) in 1934. Here, he criticised psychologism, naturalism, inductivism, and logical positivism, and put forth his theory of potential falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science. In 1935 and 1936, he took unpaid leave to go to the United Kingdom for a study visit.A. C. Ewing was responsible for Karl Popper's 1936 invitation to Cambridge (Edmonds and Eidinow 2001, p. 67)."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* A. C.

C. Ewing claimed that the reason that Kant did not use space as a transcendental schema was because space is not needed in order to understand the relational concepts of substance or causality.\"It might be asked why Kant schematized the categories in terms of time only and not of space, since space was also both sensible and a priori. The answer is perhaps simply that the second method [that of using space] would not work out so well, for time seems essential for the formulation of any tolerably clear idea of substance or causality in a way in which space is not.\"(A. C. Ewing, A Short Commentary on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, chapter IV, p. 146) According to Professor Ewing, Kant did intend to use space as a transcendental schematic mediator between a category and a sensible intuition.\"\u2026in a note written for his private use he proposes to schematize the categories in terms of space as well as time.\" (A. C. Ewing, A Short Commentary on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, chapter IV, p. 146) Kant, according to Professor Ewing, for one category did use space as a transcendental schema to unify a pure concept with a sensible intuition.\"\u2026the nearest he ever came to this [schematization] was to add the words 'in space' to the definition of [the relational category of] community [reciprocity] in the second edition [of the Critique of Pure Reason B 256].\"(A. C. Ewing, A Short Commentary on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, chapter IV, p. 146) Even though space is not needed in order to understand the relations of substance and causality, it is required in order to understand the conceptual relation of community or reciprocity.A.
