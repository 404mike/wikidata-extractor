The ill-feeling towards Allen hit a new high in October 2006 after the sacking of popular manager Sturrock, with fans attributing a slump in form to the chairman's relationship with the manager and Allen's transfer policy rather than the performance of the manager; this then led to a series of protests by supporters aimed directly at the chairperson and board of directors. However, the appointment of caretaker manager Sean McAuley and his eventual successor Brian Laws did see an improvement in results.  Allen was sometimes the basis of much criticism from Wednesday fans, who he referred to as \"scum\", \"yobs\" and \"cretins\", also labelling one female fan a \"venomous bitch\" after she voiced her frustration at Allen as he sat in the directors box at Hillsborough Stadium."]}, {"page": "Minnesota United FC", "response": ["* Sean McAuley \u2013 assistant coach"]}]}}
