There, she found many opportunities to extend her political activities. She joined the university's branch of the Fabian Society, and eventually became its joint secretary.Debenham, pp. 221\u201324. She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed Margaret Ashton, the first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies.Vernon, p. 40. Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left\u2014the veteran campaigner Charlotte Despard, the ILP leader William Crawford Anderson, and Beatrice and Sidney Webb among others.Vernon, pp. 28\u201330. She also came under the influence of Walton Newbold, an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP. The two were briefly engaged, and although this was soon broken off, they remained close political associates for many years.Vernon, pp. 33\u201337.", "Wilkinson never married, although she enjoyed numerous close friendships with men. Apart from her early engagement to Walton Newbold, she was close to John Jagger for many years,Vernon, pp. 124\u201325. and in the early 1930s enjoyed a brief romantic attachment with Frank Horrabin. Her long association with Morrison began in her early Fabian days; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship, choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association. Vernon says that the relationship almost certainly became \"more than platonic\", but as Wilkinson's private papers were destroyed after her death, and Morrison maintained silence over the matter, the full nature and extent of their friendship remains uncertain.Vernon, pp. 126\u201329. Labour MP Rachel Reeves has noted differing opinions among their respective biographers, but cites a recollection by wartime Minister P. J. Grigg as suggesting a friendship that was more than platonic.Rachel Reeves (2020) Women of Westminster  "]}, {"page": "Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Motherwell was a burgh constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1918-1974.
