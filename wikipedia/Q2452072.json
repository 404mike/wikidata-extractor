Vale exited the FA Cup at the Third Round following a humiliating 3\u20130 defeat to non-league side Enfield. They initially struggled away from home, but built their league campaign on results at Vale Park. During the season, he handed Mark Chamberlain (brother of top-scorer Neville) his debut, and brought talented winger Johnny Miller to Burslem. He sold goalkeeper Trevor Dance to non-league Stafford Rangers for \u00a310,000, as Harrison was in good form. At the way mid-way stage he brought in midfielder Terry Armstrong and big defender Andy Higgins.

Little progress was made on the previous season, as the club finished 19th. The club also 'died in shame' in the FA Cup third round, defeated 3\u20130 by Isthmian League side Enfield. Nevertheless, McGrath noted 'the attitude is slowly changing [for the better]'.
