He was born in Frankfurt to a Jewish father and a Lutheran mother; by the time he finished his school examinations in 1938 life for Jews and people associated with Jews was becoming difficult.  With the support of friends and relatives in Britain, the family were able to move to London, where he arrived in 1938 \"with a small suitcase and a large cello\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Dundee", "response": ["* Walter Eric Spear, physicist"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*1988 Walter Eric Spear, Amorphous semiconductors, a new generation of electronic materials."]}, {"page": "University of Westminster", "response": ["* Engineers and Scientists including Sir Alexander Fleming (Awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine), Sir Frederick Augustus Abel (chemist and inventor of cordite), Seweryn Chomet (theoretical physicist), Sir Diarmuid Downs (former President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers), Lewis R.
