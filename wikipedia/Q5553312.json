Australian universities did not begin awarding PhD's until 1948 (with the first at UQ being awarded in 1950). Hill continued to explore the theory that Australia had once been covered from north to south by an inland sea, as evidenced by the fossil corals she found in Mundubbera. She received a further scholarship, Senior Student of the Exhibition of 1851 for two years and the Daniel Pidgeon Fund award from the Geological Society of London which enabled her to remain in England until 1936. A number of Australian students were at Newnham College with Hill in this era, including Elizabeth \"Betty\" Ripper, who was also studying palaeontology, and Germaine Joplin. She worked with Drs William Dickson Lang and Stanley Smith on Palaeozoic coral taxonomy, at the Natural History Museum in London. After Hill's return to Australia, she continued to study at the University of Queensland and took a Doctor of Science in 1942."]}, {"page": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Gertrude Elles"]}, {"page": "Laurie Island", "response": ["Sedimentary rocks, most notably the Greywacke-Shale Formation, constitute the bulk of Laurie Island. Dr. John H. Harvey Pirie, a geologist aboard the Scotia described the rock as \"a fine-grained greywacke of a blue-grey or greenish-grey colour.\" The greywacke contained grains of many different minerals, quartz being the most numerous, along with plagioclase feldspar, titanite, zircon, biotite, chlorite, and veins of calcite. Pirie also found shale formations distributed across the island, usually fractured and twisted. Graptolite Island, off of Laurie Island's south-east coast, particularly exhibited these shale formations. It was on Graptolite Island that Pirie collected three fossils which he later mistook to be the remains of ancient animal organisms known as graptolites, hence the name of the island. Gertrude Elles believed that Pleurograptus was the specific species to which the graptolites belonged. Later analysis showed that the fossils on Graptolite Island were merely the remains of ancient plants."]}, {"page": "Wenlock Group", "response": ["The Wenlock Shales are pale or dark-grey shales which extend through Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, through Radnorshire into Carmarthenshire. They appear again southward in the Silurian patches in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. They thicken from the south northward. The fossils are on the whole closely similar to those in the limestones above with the natural difference that corals are comparatively rare in the shales, while graptolites are abundant. Six graptolite zones were recognized by Gertrude Elles in this formation."]}, {"page": "Gertrude Lilian Elles", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gertrude Elles"]}, {"page": "Ethel Shakespear", "response": ["She was born in Biddenham, Bedfordshire, the daughter of a clergyman.

In 1894 she was elected to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She was the first, due to alphabetical primacy, of eight women to be elected Fellows of the Geological Society of London, under the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919.  Prior to that, in 1907, a decision was made by the Society as associates, under the condition they declared themselves as geological investigators or summitted their own original research. She also was a member of the Paleontological Society from 1907\u20131932. She collaborated with Gertrude Elles (1872\u20131960), Ethel Wood (1871\u20131945), and Ethel Skeat (1869\u20131939). Crosfield and Skeat investigated the Denbighshire grits and flags from 1906 to 1909 and in 1911, using graptolite to establish a sequence.", "Crosfield attended school at the Mount School, York, which was one of the first in the UK to send girls to University. At twenty years old, Crosfield went to study at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1878, in which she began the study of geology as part of her course. Margret Crosfield took a period of leave due to illness. While she was on leave her father passed in 1879. He left his children \u00a38,200 in trust. This money helped independently fund Margret\u2019s research and further her studies at Cambridge. With the inherited money, Margaret did not need to work for a living and was able to focus on activities that interested her. She returned to the University 10 years later and gained special permission to study geology exclusively. On her return to Cambridge, she met two of her lifelong friends and fellow researchers, Ethel Gertrude Skeat, whom she worked extensively with on paleontological and stratigraphic research. Crosfield also was known to work with Gertrude Elles and Ethel Shakespear by identifying and verifying fossil specimens that were collected on various field campaigns."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Sherrard", "response": ["In 1950 she spent three months at the University of Cambridge and the Sedgwick Museum studying under Dr Gertrude Elles, and in 1967 examined fossil collections in Peking (later Beijing)."]}, {"page": "Sedgwick Club", "response": ["* Gertrude Elles"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Ripper", "response": ["Ripper attended the University of Melbourne taking a B.Sc. in geology from 1928-1931, winning the J.F.W. Payne exhibition in botany and Argus exhibition in geology in 1928. She was a Kernot and Wyselaskie Scholar in geology in 1932, while she undertook her M.Sc. While the Geology Department at the University was heavily influenced by the petrological studies of Prof. Ernest W. Skeats, Ripper was attracted to the palaeontological programs of Frederick A. Singleton. She attended geology field trips in company with a number of female students of the department, as well as Edwin Sherbon Hills. Ripper was first interested in Ordovician and Silurian graptolites, and would also write on Silurian (Lilydale Limestone) stromatoporoids for her Masters thesis. Frederick Chapman of the National Museum of Victoria was her mentor during this research. Her work impressed her supervisors, and Ripper was encouraged to go to Cambridge and study with Dr Gertrude Elles at the Sedgwick Museum, University of Cambridge, who was an expert on graptolites in 1933. Ripper would win an Orient free passage and take with her materials she had collected around Victoria, as well as stromatoporoids from Lilydale and Buchan. Elles was nearing retirement in 1933, and her supervision of her new Australian student, was fairly minimal. Elles had also supervised another Australian student, Dorothy Hill who took her PhD at Cambridge in 1933 and remained at Cambridge for another four years as a Fellow. Hill and Ripper would work in close quarters at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences,  Newnham College and out in the field, collecting specimens in Wales. Ripper's research deviated from graptolites, and instead focussed on the stromatoporoids she had brought from Australia. She was also able to use materials within the British Museum (Natural History) and the Sedgwick Museum with the support of mentors, Dr W. D. Lang and Dr H. Dighton Thomas. She was awarded her PhD in 1936. Ripper published her research in Australian journals."]}, {"page": "Ann Greenly", "response": ["Together with her husband, Greenly regularly attended the annual meetings of the Geological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and other conferences and meetings.

He published his first paper on Cretaceous Echinoids from Nigeria in 1925, and studied the collections of the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. The Sedgwick Museum at the time was curated largely by volunteers and teaching staff from Cambridge, in particular W.B.R. King and Gertrude Elles. Brighton offered his services and his work in systematically ordering and sorting the existing collections. In 1931, a post as full-time curator was offered to Brighton. The salary was small however, and Brighton continued his teaching positions with the Department to supplement it.", "Over half a million specimens had yet to be sorted and described when Brighton took the Curator's position in 1931. Brighton brought in a new system for cataloguing items, such that the first instance of an object's description would be noted for future reference and citation. Many of the staff at Cambridge preferred their existing methods of description. Dorothy Hill, who was undertaking her PhD under Elles\u2019 supervision brought her collection of Carboniferous corals from Australia, and utilised Gertrude Elles\u2019 system, necessitating a change in how the fossils were described and indexed at the Sedgwick. Brighton's goal was to catalogue 12,000 items a year. When he retired in 1968 he had catalogued almost 375,000 items over the course of 37 years. The  collection became more accessible and was considered a highly desirable research collection to utilize."]}, {"page": "Sue Rigby", "response": ["Rigby's heroine is the paleontologist Gertrude Elles."]}]}}
