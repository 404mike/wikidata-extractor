According to the Lincolnshire Echo, \"a considerable sum was paid for his transfer.\" Clarke was a regular in Lincoln's team in his first season, appearing in 30 of the 34 Second Division matches. He began at outside left, with George Fern inside him, but after five matches the two changed places. He was ever-present in the side until a match against Manchester City at Hyde Road in February 1899: with the scores level at half-time, Lincoln's defence held out for much of the second half, but the hosts scored twice late on, provoking \"a degree of unpleasantness, which led to Clarke fouling an opponent badly and being ordered off the field.\" During April, he played four times in the half-back line."]}, {"page": "George Ferne", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Fern"]}, {"page": "Fern, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Fern"]}, {"page": "Fern (name)", "response": ["* George Fern, English footballer"]}]}}
