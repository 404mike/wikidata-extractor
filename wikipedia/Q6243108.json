He wrote primarily for the action-adventure and espionage genres. Perhaps because of his early involvement in The Avengers, he often found work on shows that featured fantasy adventure, rather than the kitchen sink realism that had arisen in Britain at the start of his career. Series with extraordinary lead characters in unusual circumstances, such as Department S, Jason King, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) and The Adventurer, dominated his output.\nHe has been credited with creating the short-lived dramas Intrigue and Counterstrike, as well as being a key player in the development of Adam Adamant Lives!.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doppelg\u00e4nger (1969 film)", "response": ["Assisted by Tony Williamson, Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, had written a 194-page treatment long before the initial meeting with Kanter.Anderson 2007, p.\u00a065.

According to Gerry, this term \"means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word\".
