A member of its first Executive Committee (1904\u20131905), Martin was expelled on 8 April 1905 owing to his joining an unemployed rights association. He rejoined the Party on 6 November 1906 and left again, only to rejoin on 19 June 1908. He was then a speaker for the Party (1909\u20131911), an Executive Committee member (1911) and briefly Lambeth branch secretary (1911) before finally resigning over the WB of Upton Park affair in 1911. The issue at stake was essentially whether socialist MPs should vote for reforms, the dissidents taking the stance that they never should. He was a member of the anti-reform Provisional Committee of 1911 and subsequently long-term organiser of the Socialist Propaganda League (an SPGB split-off). He died early in 1951, aged 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Martin", "response": ["*Henry Martin (socialist) (1864\u20131951), known as Harry, British socialist", "*Henry Martin (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Henry Martin", "response": ["Henry Martin may refer to:", "* Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet (1733\u20131794), Royal Navy officer, MP for Southampton 1790\u201394", "* Henry Martin (Kinsale MP) (1763\u20131839), UK MP for the Irish constituency of Kinsale 1806\u20131818", "* Henry Martin (socialist) (1864\u20131951), British socialist", "* Henry Martin (general) (1888\u20131984), French military commander", "* Sir Henry Martin, 2nd Baronet (1768\u20131842), MCC cricketer", "* Henry Martin (footballer) (1891\u20131974), Sunderland and England footballer", "* Henry Martin (racecar driver) (born 1965), race car driver from Argentina", "* Henry Martin (soccer) (born 1997), American soccer player", "*Henry Martin (priest) (1830\u20131903), Archdeacon of Lindisfarne", "* Henry Martin (bishop) (1889\u20131971), Anglican bishop in Canada", "* Henry Martin (murderer) (died 1866), British murderer", "* Henry Martin (cartoonist) (1925-2020), American cartoonist", "* \"Henry Martin\" (song), a traditional Scottish folk tune about a pirate", "*Martinizing, named after the chemist Henry Martin"]}, {"page": "Henry Martin (political figure)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Martin (socialist)"]}, {"page": "List of Socialist Party of Great Britain members", "response": ["*Henry Martin (1904\u20131905, 1908\u20131911)"]}, {"page": "Hans Neumann", "response": ["Neumann resigned on 12 September 1911.
