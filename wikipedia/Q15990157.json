Before the area was built over Owen Manning and William Bray noted this route in their History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey (1814), saying that the line \"took its course by Old Croydon and the West side of Broad Green where it is still visible\". Further possible support to the theory is given by a title deed of the late 1280s, by which a piece of property, described as lying on the east side of the king's highway in Old Town, was sold by one \"Andrew de Calceto in Croyndon\", also named as \"Andrew ate Causie\", both forms of his name meaning \"of/at the causeway\", a term which implies a well constructed road. The modern A236 dual carriageway, which bypasses Croydon to the west, is named Roman Way in acknowledgement of this theory. A little further south, the road may have followed the line of Duppas Hill Terrace and Violet Lane.
