Five players (Alan Lee, Rhys Weston, Tony Warner, Chris Barker and Neil Alexander) accepted \"substantial reductions in their wages\" to allow the club to meet Purse's wage demands. He was appointed team captain, and forged a reputation for hard work and consistency as the foundation of the Cardiff defence, forming an effective partnership with Glenn Loovens. He scored six goals in 43 games in 2005\u201306 and scored four goals in 33 games in 2006\u201307.

After being an unused substitute for a league match against Stoke City, on 21 September 2004, Anthony made his professional debut, being named in the starting line-up in a 4\u20131 victory over Milton Keynes Dons in the Football League Cup after Rhys Weston pulled out due to injury.

In November, Ross Gardner was signed on loan from Nottingham Forest, and would join permanently in the January transfer window. Foyle also signed defender Clayton Fortune on a season long loan for a second time, this time from Leyton Orient. Heading into December with just three wins in fifteen league games, they won their first four games, with Constantine hitting five of Vale's nine goals.

He also turned down an offer from Barnsley of \u00a3200,000 (plus Marc Richards) for Constantine, who claimed to be happy at Vale Park. However he did sell skilful winger Jeff Smith to Carlisle United for \u00a360,000. Also leaving Burslem was Louis Briscoe, who was allowed to join Leek Town. Vale's form had left them once again, as they failed to pick up a win in a sequence of seven games.

Leon Constantine also decided against signing a new contract at Vale, and instead joined Leeds United.
