His last game for Mansfield came on 23 October 1961 in a League Cup tie against Cardiff City at Ninian Park where Mansfield lost 2\u20131. He left Mansfield at the end of the 1961\u201362 season, and subsequently played a couple of seasons for non-league Ilkeston Town before retiring from playing the game.\nHe continued to work in football into his 60s, including a role as a boys football coach at Oldswinford Hospital School in the West Midlands.\nHe died in June 1997, at the age of 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Freddie Steele (footballer)", "response": ["Steele assumed a player-manager role at Mansfield Town in 1949. He was prolific in front of goal, scoring 44 goals in 62 league and cup appearances \u2013 this scoring record made his job as manager much easier.

They then went on a 23-game unbeaten run, but could only end up finishing as the division's runners-up in 1950\u201351, seven points behind champions Rotherham United. Steele signed players such as defender Don Bradley, and wing-half's Oscar Fox and Sid Watson.
