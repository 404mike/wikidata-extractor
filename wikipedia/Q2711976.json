He is best known for the long series Horrible Science, illustrated by Tony De Saulles, and the short series Wild Lives, illustrated by Jane Cope. His other works include some published under the name Robert Roland.Arnold was born in Cambridge, England. His first published works appeared as a result of a project he was working on at the University of North London, when he was trying to teach young children. A positive review was written about him and he started to write the Horrible Science books.\nArnold left school with many history qualifications but decided to become a writer. He found it hard to get published however. He became an editor in London hoping that \"working as an editor might help him get his own books published\". In London, he struggled to find work, eventually taking a job editing science books. Nick began to write articles with a friend named Vip Patel. Some of these ended up in The Guardian newspaper. Eventually he was out of work and decided to write books so wrote to every publisher in Britain requesting work. Scholastic pitched to him the concept of a series named \"Horrible Science\" and Arnold soon wrote Ugly Bugs. An illustrator for Scholastic named Tony De Saulles was hired as the illustrator for the series. This book was released alongside Blood, Bones and Body Bits, and the high sales solidified the series. In 1998, he broke his arm whilst performing a Horrible Science show. He finished the show and signed books before being rushed to the hospital. In 2004, Arnold became the first British author to tour China. He and Tony De Saulles filmed a TV show there and promoted the Chinese edition of the Horrible Science series.\nIn 2006, Arnold founded the Appledore Book Festival after leading a campaign to save the Appledore village library from closure. Two years later, Arnold achieved publicity for his claim to have located the site of the Battle of Cynuit, fought between Saxons and Danes in 878.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Horrible Histories (book series)", "response": ["* Horrible Science (written by Nick Arnold and illustrated by Tony de Saulles)"]}, {"page": "Horrible Science", "response": ["Horrible Science is a similar series of books to Horrible Histories, written by Nick Arnold (with the exception of Evolve or Die, which is written by Phil Gates), illustrated by Tony de Saulles and published in the UK and India by Scholastic. They are designed to get children interested in science by concentrating on the trivial, unusual, gory, or unpleasant. The books are in circulation in 24 countries, and over 4 million books have been sold in the UK alone.", "Nick Arnold released a paper entitled \"Teaching Science the Horrible Way\",Teaching Science the Horrible Way  in which he demonstrates the reasons why the Horrible Science series has a positive contribution to learning. According to Arnold, Horrible Science books are based on everyday topics and key areas of the curriculum. The range of approaches used in Horrible Science books are intended to emphasise the drama and excitement and wonder of science. Science words and concepts are introduced gradually often using humour or fact files. Although mathematics is not needed at the level of science covered in the books, some activities require calculators. The books contain experiments under the heading Dare you discover... The experiments do not require expensive or elaborate equipment. Several of the books end with thoughts on how science will shape our future. On his website, Nick Arnold also has downloadable experiments for teachers to use in the classroom as an aid to his books (e.g. the Horrible Hydrogen experiment at Horrible Hydrogen ).", "Before writing the series, Nick Arnold was at the University of North London working on an educational project. He explained to The Birmingham Post: \"It was actually a lucky break or a well-placed letter\u00a0\u2013 whichever you want to believe\u00a0\u2013 Because I wrote this really cheeky letter to the publishers Scholastic saying that if they were looking for someone to write a horrible science book I was the one. And would you believe they actually let me write a science book and put lots of horrible bits in it\u00a0\u2013 and then it was hugely successful\u201d.", "Nick Arnold explained his approach towards writing the series in an interview with The Birmingham Post: \"My approach to a subject is to vastly over-research it. I have become quite good at science by writing these books so have got quite a lot of knowledge already but then I really like finding out more information. If I over-research then I don\u2019t just have all the facts I need, I have a lot more\u00a0\u2013 and that means I can really choose what I want to include. The thing about a Horrible Science book is that actually it is all about imagination. The more you know the more you want to know and the more you want to develop that.\"", "The response towards the series has been generally positive. Some reviews of the series website  included a The Independent review that Really Rotten Experiments is \"Perfect for keeping the kids occupied on a rainy day, this is full of useful tips...and fun, naughty experiments\". Another review by the Evening Express (Aberdeen) said that the book Horrible Science: Painful Poison is \"With fantastic fact files, quirky quizzes, humorous cartoons and easy-to-understand text, it makes science pretty horrible, but great fun\". Books For Keeps said of the book Deadly Diseases: \"Gruesome gut churning contents, you need a strong stomach to tackle this, and certainly before eating\". The Scotsman commented on the series as a whole, \"Nick Arnold has a reputation as quite a showman and his Horrible Science series provides him with plenty of opportunity for stunts. Children emerge wide-eyed and inspired\". A review at  described the series as \"These are so much better than some of the dry textbooks that I used to have to read when I was in school...I'm saying that books like this are great for students because they show students that science is truly interesting and amazing!\". A review by Roberta of the Growing with Science blog said of the book Chemical Chaos: \"It is every bit as humorous (downright silly in spots) and as comprehensive as the history series was\". She adds that the \"[series as a whole] go a long way to fill that gap [between middle and high school students\". As said of Evil Inventions in a review by", "*The ZSL Thomson Reuters Record Award for Communicating Science awarded to Nick Arnold and Tony De Saulles for Wasted World.

He added that \"What is really clever about the production is that it is actually a story on a very fundamental level.
