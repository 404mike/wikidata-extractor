However, Johnson hit back completing the signings of James Dayton, Sidney Schmeltz and Korey Smith. The latter chose to make his initial loan into a permanent deal with Johnson also appointing the player as the new team captain. Oldham started the season as Johnson intended, winning 4\u20133 at Stevenage. Such form continued throughout the season, with Oldham playing high quality football, receiving plaudits from opposition managers and pundits alike. In January various changes were made, notably losing the services of James Tarkowksi to Brentford for an undisclosed fee. Johnson made signings that would go on to make a big impact to Oldham's second half of the season, most notably the loan of Gary Harkins from St. Mirren. After various excellent performances throughout the first half of the season, Johnson was rewarded with a renewed contract, extending it until the summer of 2018, stating, \"I love the club, the new contract extension makes me feel valued by the owner and the board. I know I will get it right and that I will be given time to do that, at what is a fantastic club\". As their season came to a close, the Latics ended the season on a 10-game unbeaten run, which saw the club finish fifteenth, two points short of the top\u2013half of the table, making this the club's best finish for the side since the end of the 2008\u201309 season under John Sheridan."]}, {"page": "Michael Spillane (footballer)", "response": ["On 26 September 2015, Spillane signed for Lowestoft Town, becoming the eighth former Norwich player at the club.

Weston scored his first goal of the season on 9 October 2010, in a 3\u20131 loss against Oldham Athletic. However, in a 4\u20132 win over Exeter City on 30 October 2010, Weston was in a row with Robbie Simpson over a penalty kick and took a penalty spot, which resulted he missed the spot kick. This caused Manager Andy Scott to inform that Weston should not take penalties again. He then signed a contract extension on 26 November 2010, keeping him until 2013. Although he was absent from the first team on two occasions by the end of 2011, Weston continued to regain his first team for the rest of the season despite being a move away from the club in January.
