He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock.

The Geniza fragments, he argues, make it clear the Judaising reforms sent roots down into the whole of the population. The pattern is one of an elite conversion preceding large-scale adoption of the new religion by the general population, which often resisted the imposition. One important condition for mass conversion was a settled urban state, where churches, synagogues or mosques provided a focus for religion, as opposed to the free nomadic lifestyle of life on the open steppes.

The core of the United Kingdom as a unified state came into being in 1707 with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland,New Act of Union would strengthen UK, says Fabricant BBC News, accessed 1 September 2013 into a new unitary state called Great Britain.The terms One Kingdom, United Kingdom and United Kingdom of Great Britain were used as descriptions in the Treaty of Union and the Acts of Union 1707. However, the actual name of the new state was Great Britain. The name Great Britain (then sometimes spelled Great Brittaine) was first used by James VI/I in October 1604, who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain, not Kings of England and Scotland. However the name was not applied to a new state; both England and Scotland continued to be governed independently. Its validity as a name of the Crown is also questioned, given that monarchs continued using separate ordinals (e.g., James VI/I, James VII/II) in England and Scotland. To avoid confusion historians generally avoid using the term King of Great Britain until 1707 and instead to match the ordinal usage call the monarchs kings or queens of England and Scotland. Separate ordinals were abandoned when the two states merged in accordance with the Acts of Union 1707, with subsequent monarchs using ordinals clearly based on English not Scottish history (it might be argued that the monarchs have simply taken the higher ordinal, which to date has always been English). One example is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who is referred to as being \"the Second\" even though there never was an Elizabeth I of Scotland or Great Britain. Thus the term Great Britain is generally used from 1707.

William the Conqueror, who was a great lover of hunting, established and enforced a system of forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from hunting by the common people of England and reserved hunting rights for the new French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Henceforth hunting of game in royal forests by commoners or in other words poaching, was invariably punishable by death by hanging. In 1087, a poem called \"The Rime of King William\" contained in the Peterborough Chronicle, expressed English indignation at the severe new laws. Poaching was romanticised in literature from the time of the ballads of Robin Hood, as an aspect of the \"greenwood\" of Merry England; in one tale, Robin Hood is depicted as offering King Richard the Lion Heart venison from deer illegally hunted in the Sherwood Forest, the King overlooking the fact that this hunting was a capital offence.  The widespread acceptance of this common criminal activity is encapsulated in the observation Non est inquirendum, unde venit venison (\"It is not to be inquired, whence comes the venison\"), made by Guillaume Bud\u00e9 in his Traitte de la v\u00e9nerie.Bud\u00e9, G.

The governor was supported by various officers, in particular his deputy, the lieutenant de roi, or lieutenant of the king, who was responsible for general security and the protection of state secrets; the major, responsible for managing the Bastille's financial affairs and the police archives; and the capitaine des portes, who ran the entrance to the Bastille. Four warders divided up the eight towers between them.Bournon, p. 71. From an administrative perspective, the prison was generally well run during the period. These staff were supported by an official surgeon, a chaplain and could, on occasion, call upon the services of a local midwife to assist pregnant prisoners.Bournon, pp. 66, 68. A small garrison of \"invalides\" was appointed in 1749 to guard the interior and exterior of the fortress; these were retired soldiers and were regarded locally, as Simon Schama describes, as \"amiable layabouts\" rather than professional soldiers.Schama, p .339; Bournon, p. 73.", "Modern historians of this period, such as Hans-J\u00fcrgen L\u00fcsebrink, Simon Schama and Monique Cottret (fr), concur that the actual treatment of prisoners in Bastille was much better than the public impression left through these writings.Schama, p. 334; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 27. Nonetheless, fuelled by the secrecy that still surrounded the Bastille, official as well as public concern about the prison and the system that supported it also began to mount, prompting reforms.L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 27. As early as 1775, Louis XVI's minister Malesherbes had authorised all prisoners to be given newspapers to read, and to be allowed to write and to correspond with their family and friends.Funck-Brentano, pp. 78\u20139. In the 1780s Breteuil, the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi, began a substantial reform of the system of lettres de cachet that sent prisoners to the Bastille: such letters were now required to list the length of time a prisoner would be detained for, and the offence for which they were being held.Gillispie, p. 247; Funck-Brentano, p. 78.", "Within hours of its capture the Bastille began to be used as a powerful symbol to give legitimacy to the revolutionary movement in France.Reichardt, p. 240; Schama, p. 345; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 86. The faubourg Saint-Antoine's revolutionary reputation was firmly established by their storming of the Bastille and a formal list began to be drawn up of the \"vainqueurs\" who had taken part so as to honor both the fallen and the survivors.Hazan, p. 122; Schama, p. 347. Although the crowd had initially gone to the Bastille searching for gunpowder, historian Simon Schama observes how the captured prison \"gave a shape and an image to all the vices against which the Revolution defined itself\".Reichardt, p. 240; Schama, p. 345. Indeed, the more despotic and evil the Bastille was portrayed by the pro-revolutionary press, the more necessary and justified the actions of the Revolution became. Consequently, the late governor, de Launay, was rapidly vilified as a brutal despot.L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, p. 64. The fortress itself was described by the revolutionary press as a \"place of slavery and horror\", containing \"machines of death\", \"grim underground dungeons\" and \"disgusting caves\" where prisoners were left to rot for up to 50 years.L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt, pp. 74, 77.", "In the 1970s French sociologists, particularly those interested in critical theory, re-examined this historical legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on the operation of the police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes. Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse L\u00fcsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent.Crook, pp. 245\u20136; L\u00fcsebrink and Reichardt (1997). This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille.Colley, pp. 12\u20133; Schama (2004).
