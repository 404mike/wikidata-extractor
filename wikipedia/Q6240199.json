He was a merchant in the City of London being head of the firm 'J. Hubbard & Co.', Russian Merchants.\nHe was by profession a banker, his family had a business in St Petersburg, which was not strictly commercial, but had an operation in London. It was enough for him to become a director of Guardian Fire and Life Assurance Co. In 1838 he joined the elite as a director of the Bank of England, later rising to become successively Deputy Governor and then Governor.\nConvinced capital and income should be treated differently he lobbied parliament to recognise the legal treatment of income tax on earned income only, which was eventually achieved in 1907. He was of Chairman of the Public Works and Exchequer Loan Committee between 1853 and 1875.\nHubbard was deeply interested in religion and the High Church in the Puseyite tradition, yet he rejected ritualism. In 1863 he built and endowed St Alban's Church, Holborn, where he was also churchwarden. Father Mackonochie, an Irish priest, used a Catholic ritual not to his liking, which prompted a stiff letter to the Bishop of London in 1868.Hubbard was a JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Buckinghamshire and the City of London. In his lifetime Hubbard was active in funding Canon Nathaniel Woodard's national network of Woodard Schools.\nHubbard was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham at the 1859 general election. He was re-elected in 1865 but when Buckingham's representation was reduced to one MP at the 1868 general election he was defeated. He returned to the House of Commons at the 1874 general election when he was elected as one of the four MPs for the City of London, and held the seat until he was created 1st Baron Addington, of Addington, Buckinghamshire, on 22 July 1887. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor in 1874.\nHubbard died at Addington Manor, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 84.\nHubbard married Maria Margaret Napier, daughter of Captain William John Napier, 9th Lord Napier of Merchistoun, and Eliza Cochrane-Johnstone, on 19 May 1837, and they had the following children:\n\nAlice Eliza Hubbard (1841\u20131931)\nEgerton Hubbard, 2nd Baron Addington (1842\u20131915)\nLucy Marian Hubbard (1845\u20131893)\nCecil John Hubbard (1846\u20131926)\nArthur Gellibrand Hubbard (1848\u20131896)\nRose Ellen Hubbard (1851\u20131933)\nEvelyn Hubbard (1852\u20131934)\nClemency Hubbard (1856\u20131940)His three sons, Egerton, Cecil John, and Evelyn were educated at Radley College. Hubbard played a decisive role in rescuing the school's finances when they collapsed in 1860. He effectively refounded the school using his acumen to raise the fees, boost numbers, and fund the debts. In the same year that he was elevated to the peerage, the school paid the last installment. Baron Addington was a friend of Montagu Norman, a Governor of the Bank of England, who also had a strong connection to the school.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington, MP 1859-87"]}, {"page": "Bloxham School", "response": ["In 1859, Hewett's dilapidated school buildings were bought for \u00a31,615 by Philip Reginald Egerton, a Church of England curate working in Deddington. Like Hewett, he was strongly influenced by the Oxford Movement and sought to establish a new school to teach its values.Old Bloxhamist Society, 'P. R. Egerton: The Years of Risk, 1859-1864', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 13-30. Egerton adopted the previous foundation's name of All Saints' School, and its motto, but based the school's ethos on that of his alma mater, Winchester College. He sought the backing of several notable academics and clergymen, including Wilberforce, Woodard and Henry Liddon. The project was initially funded by Egerton's wealthy wife, Harriet, and received its first pupil on 31 January 1860. Under the personal leadership of Egerton, Bloxham initially provided education for middle class boys in the public school tradition, although classics was originally not widely taught. In 1861 there were 29 pupils and by 1863 there were 60. Thanks to Wilberforce's continued support, Street drew up new plans for expanding the neo-Gothic school buildings, and additional money was provided by John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington and John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. The new buildings were unveiled in 1864 in the presence of Thomas Parker, 6th Earl of Macclesfield and Benjamin Disraeli. The Chapel Wing, the last of Street's buildings, was opened on 21 February 1873."]}, {"page": "John Gellibrand Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington"]}, {"page": "Evelyn Barker", "response": ["Born in Southsea, Hampshire, England, on 22 May 1894, Evelyn Hugh Barker was the son of Major General Sir George Barker, a British Army officer of the Royal Engineers, and Hon.
