Among the most popular exhibits was a substantial display of works of art organised and underwritten by the railway magnate William Dargan. The enthusiasm of the visiting crowds demonstrated a public for art, and it was decided to establish a permanent public art collection as a lasting monument of gratitude to Dargan. The moving spirit behind the proposal was the barrister John Edward Pigot (1822\u20131871), son of David Richard Pigot, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and he became one of the first governors of the gallery.National Gallery of Ireland Act 1854 section 7.

In his 1892 Conversations with Carlyle, Duffy recounts this initial meeting and quotes from Jane Carlyle's half-burnt diary that had been rescued from a general fire meant to destroy all of her personal memoirs. Here Jane commented on meeting for the first time \"real hot and hot live Irishmen\" such as she had \"never seen before\" (J. Carlyle qtd. in Duffy, 1892, p. 1). While \"no blood was shed\" during this friendly but combative meeting, O'Hagan's nose began to bleed profusely. Jane Carlyle writes: \"while they were all three at the loudest defence [sic] of Ireland against the foul aspersions Carlyle had . . . 'scornfully' cast on it, [O'Hagan's nose] . . . burst out bleeding.
