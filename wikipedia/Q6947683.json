He was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as an Independent Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Dublin South at the 1922 general election. He was re-elected as an independent TD at the 1923 and June 1927 general elections. At the September 1927 general election, he was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD, and was re-elected at the 1932 general election. He lost his seat at the 1933 general election but was elected as a Fine Gael TD at the 1937 general election.

The farming carried out at Keogh's home place in Leighlinbridge was arable, barley being the main crop. This meant that the Keogh family were largely unaffected by the hunger and poverty that accompanied the Great Famine and ravaged the country between 1845 and 1850 \u2013 Keogh's childhood days. However, two, or possibly three, of Keogh's siblings did die young, apparently from typhoid \u2013 a disease associated with the famine and an illness that Myles also suffered as a boy.", "By 1860, a twenty-year-old Myles Keogh had volunteered, along with over one thousand of his countrymen, to rally to the defence of Pope Pius IX following a call to arms by the Catholic clergy in Ireland. By August 1860, Keogh was appointed second lieutenant of his unit in the Battalion of St. Patrick, Papal Army under the command of General Christophe L\u00e9on Louis Juchault de Lamorici\u00e8re. He was posted at Ancona, a central port city of Italy. The Papal forces were defeated in September in the Battle of Castelfidardo, and Ancona was surrounded. The soldiers, although having admirable defence, were forced to surrender and Keogh was imprisoned at Genoa. After his quick release by exchange, Keogh went to Rome and was invited to wear the spirited green uniforms of the Company of St. Patrick as a member of the Vatican Guard. During his service, the Holy See awarded him the Medaglia for gallantry \u2013 the Pro Petri Sede Medal \u2013 and also the Cross of a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great \u2013 Ordine di San Gregorio.Myles Keogh: The Life and Legend of an \"Irish Dragoon\" in the Seventh Cavalry, John P.

Buford's 1st Division of cavalry fought with distinction in June 1863 as they skirmished with their much vaunted Confederate foe, led by J.E.B. Stuart in Loudoun County, Virginia \u2013 most notably at Upperville.", "thumb|1865 \u2013 Major Myles Keogh, Union Army, standing, Robert Morrow seated", "thumb|right|Myles Keogh", "On 30 June, Buford, with Keogh by his side, rode into the small town of Gettysburg. Very soon, Buford realised that he was facing a superior force of rebels to his front and set about creating a defence against the Confederate advance. He was acutely aware of the importance of holding the tactically important high ground about Gettysburg and so he did, beginning one of the most iconic battles in American military history. His intelligent defensive troop alignments, coupled with the bravery and tenacity of his dismounted men, allowed the 1st Corps, under General John F. Reynolds, time to come up in support and thus maintain a Union foothold at strategically important positions. Despite Lee's barrage attack of 140 cannons and a final infantry attack on the third day of the battle, the Union army won a highly significant victory. The importance of Buford's leadership and tactical foresight on 1 July cannot be overstated in its contribution to this victory. Significantly, Myles Keogh received his first brevet for \"gallant and meritorious services\" during the battle and was promoted to the rank of major.", "The praise garnered from the commanders Myles Keogh served with during the war years was indeed high:", "thumb|left|Telegram informing of the death of Myles Keogh", "* Myles Keogh: The Life and Legend of an \"Irish Dragoon\" in the Seventh Cavalry, John P.
