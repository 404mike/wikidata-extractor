Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw to write a new play, and he concentrated on prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal, Major Barbara (1941), was less successful both artistically and commercially than Pygmalion, partly because of Pascal's insistence on directing, to which he was unsuited."]}, {"page": "January 13", "response": ["*1976 \u2013 Margaret Leighton, English actress (b. 1922)"]}, {"page": "1976", "response": ["* January 13 \u2013 Margaret Leighton, English actress (b. 1922)"]}, {"page": "1922", "response": ["** Margaret Leighton, British actress (d. 1976)"]}, {"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["The triumvirate secured the New Theatre for their first season and recruited a company.
