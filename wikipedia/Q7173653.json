He made his name with the Logics of Disintegration, on the limitations of post-structuralism. He is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Essex.\nHis first degree was in English, at Queens' College, Cambridge. He has a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Southampton.\nDews is known for his work on the New Left, called 'The New Philosophers and the End of Leftism'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Peter Dews"]}, {"page": "The History of Sexuality", "response": ["The philosopher Roger Scruton rejected Foucault's claim that sexual morality is culturally relative in Sexual Desire (1986). He also criticized Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur. Scruton concluded that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"Scruton 1994. pp. 34, 362. The philosopher Peter Dews argued in Logics of Disintegration that Foucault's rejection of the repressive hypothesis is more apparent than real, and that the hypothesis is not \"abolished, but simply displaced\" in The History of Sexuality, as shown for example by Foucault's persistent references to \"the body and its pleasures\" and to ars erotica.Dews 2007. p. 205. The classicist Page duBois called The Use of Pleasure \"one of the most exciting new books\" in classical studies and \"an important contribution to the history of sexuality\", but added that Foucault \"takes for granted, and thus 'authorizes,' exactly what needs to be explained: the philosophical establishment of the autonomous male subject\".duBois 1988. p. 2. The historian Patricia O'Brien wrote that Foucault was \"without expertise\" in dealing with antiquity, and that The History of Sexuality lacks the \"methodological rigor\" of Foucault's earlier works, especially Discipline and Punish.O'Brien 1989. p. 42."]}, {"page": "List of works in critical theory", "response": ["* Peter Dews"]}, {"page": "Nietzsche and Philosophy", "response": ["The philosopher Stephen Houlgate rejected Deleuze's view of Hegelian dialectic as the ultimate denial of life, writing that Deleuze was misled by Nietzsche. Michael Tanner described Nietzsche and Philosophy as a celebrated work. He considered it \"quite wild about Nietzsche, but interesting about Deleuze.\" The philosopher Hans Sluga identified Nietzsche and Philosophy as a possible influence on the philosopher Michel Foucault. He suggested that the work helped Foucault to discover Nietzsche as a \"genealogical thinker, the philosopher of the will to power.\" The philosopher Christopher Norris wrote that Deleuze approached Nietzsche in a way \"sharply at odds with the received exegetical wisdom\", and that Nietzsche and Philosophy was an \"expository tour de force\". The philosopher Peter Dews wrote that Nietzsche and Philosophy was central to the post-structuralist texts of the decade that followed its publication, including Anti-Oedipus. Che-ming Yang described the book as a masterpiece, maintaining that it shows that the reading of Nietzsche is central to Deleuze's philosophical project. The philosopher Alan D. Schrift wrote that it \"was a major factor in the development of interest in Nietzsche in France in the 1960s.\""]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Peter Dews"]}, {"page": "Contemporary Psychoanalytic Studies", "response": ["*Peter Dews"]}, {"page": "Libidinal Economy", "response": ["Commentators have compared Libidinal Economy to Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus. The philosopher Peter Dews argues that Libidinal Economy, while part of a phase of Lyotard's thought less well-known than Anti-Oedipus in the English-speaking world, is important for its \"treatment of the problem of the appropriate reaction to the erosion of the traditional\" caused by \"the incessant expansion of capitalist economic relations\"; he also praises Lyotard's critique of Lacan. However, he argues that because Lyotard rejects Deleuze and Guattari's idea of opposing \"good\" revolutionary desire to \"bad\" fascist desire, Libidinal Economy is \"bereft of any political or moral orientation\". He notes that Lyotard subsequently rejected ideas he had advocated in the book, in order to discuss a \"post-modern concept of justice\", arguing that this could be considered an attempt by Lyotard to \"make amends\" for its \"implicit amoralism\". Dews suggests that Lyotard too quickly rejected the perspective advanced in the work."]}, {"page": "Dews", "response": ["*Peter Dews (born 1952), British philosopher", "*Peter Dews (director) (1929\u20131997), English stage director"]}, {"page": "List of Radical Thinkers releases", "response": ["|Peter Dews"]}, {"page": "Peter Dews", "response": ["Peter Dews may refer to:", "*Peter Dews (director) (1933\u20131997), English stage director"]}]}}
