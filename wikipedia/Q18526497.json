She edited a new edition (the 64th) of Maria Rundell's cookery book A New System of Domestic Cookery, and also a book of poetry by her friend Letitia Landon. But by 1839 she decided to return to India, not simply by sailing directly, but by crossing overland from France, through Egypt to Suez, and then by ship to Bombay. She went with only a female friend and took only two months to complete her journey, arriving at the end of October. This was a similar journey to that made by Anne Elwood, who thought Roberts's journey too quick. Roberts wrote a book about her journey. In India she returned to editing, the Bombay Gazette being one title, but died suddenly in September 1840 and was buried near the grave of Maria Jane Jewsbury."]}]}}
