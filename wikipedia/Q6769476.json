This then led to Kevin Keegan paying \u00a3450,000 to take the defender to Newcastle United, March 1993. Robinson helped the Magpies secure promotion to the Premier League later that season.\nIn 1994 he suffered a broken leg in a horror tackle by a Hartlepool player, and Keegan said \"we came to Hartlepool to help the club out financially, and we've ended up with a player fighting to save his career\". Kevin Keegan also once said he would never return to Hartlepool's Victoria Park after a pre-season friendly went wrong.\nHe was signed for a substantial amount by Keegan to bolster the defence, but was never the same player after the game at Hartlepool. He lost a lot of pace, which was his major strength.\nRobinson made only 16 appearances during Newcastle's return to the top flight and in the summer of 1994 Swindon Town paid \u00a3600,000 for his services.\nRobinson spent the rest of his professional career at the Wiltshire outfit playing 316 matches - scoring 4 times. Robinson was voted the 32nd all-time best Swindon Town player to pull on the red shirt.\nAfter injuries plagued him during the 2001\u201302 season Robinson retired from professional football and joined nearby Chippenham Town.\nHe has 3 sons called Elliot, Harry and Bailey, and a daughter called Lucy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Robinson", "response": ["Mark Robinson may refer to:", "*Mark Robinson (musician) (born 1967), American musician and founder of Teenbeat Records", "*Mark Robinson (drummer) (born 1989), American drummer and founder of Storyboard Records", "*Mark Robinson (Friends), a fictional character in the American sitcom Friends", "*Mark Robinson (English politician) (born 1946), former British Conservative politician", "*Mark Robinson (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1959), Democratic Unionist Party Northern Ireland Assembly Member", "*Mark Robinson (Australian politician) (born 1963), Deputy Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*Mark Robinson (American politician), current Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina ()", "*Mark Robinson (cricketer, born 1966), English cricketer for Northamptonshire, Yorkshire, Sussex and Canterbury", "*Mark Robinson (Shropshire cricketer) (born 1984), English cricketer for Shropshire", "*Mark Robinson (footballer, born 1968), retired footballer", "*Mark Robinson (footballer, born 1981), English professional footballer", "*Mark Robinson (American football) (born 1962), American, former NFL football player", "*Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974), New Zealand rugby union centre, and later rugby executive", "*Mark Robinson (rugby, born 1975), New Zealand rugby union scrum half (also briefly played rugby league)", "*Mark Robinson (rugby league) (born 1964), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Mark Robinson (darts player) (born 1963), English professional darts player", "*Mark Robinson (Royal Navy officer) (1722\u20131799), English officer", "*Mark Robinson (meteorologist) (born 1973), Canadian television meteorologist and storm chaser", "*Mark Robinson (journalist), chief football writer of the Herald Sun"]}, {"page": "Mark Robinson (footballer born 1968)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Robinson (footballer, born 1968)"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Most appearances || Mark Robinson and Kevin Horlock (58)"]}]}}
