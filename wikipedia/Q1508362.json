The cathedral had originally been designed by Richard Lankesheer, and construction had commenced in 1839 before being suspended in 1841 due to structural problems. Lankesheer died suddenly in March 1841, and his death might have been suicide. Scamp oversaw the stabilization works in 1841\u201342 and the construction of the rest of the cathedral, which was completed in 1844. He made a number of substantial changes to the cathedral's original plans in the process, with his most notable contribution being the design of the bell tower and shifting its position to make it a free-standing structure. The bell tower of the cathedral forms a prominent part of Valletta's skyline. Scamp also designed the cathedral's interior, and he seems to have been inspired by Nicholas Hawksmoor's St Mary Woolnoth church in London. Scamp's intended location for the high altar was altered in accordance with the wishes of Bishop George Tomlinson, although later alterations in the 20th century resulted in a redesign according to Scamp's plans."]}, {"page": "Conversazione", "response": ["* The intellectual society at Cambridge University known as the Apostles was founded in 1820 as the  Conversazione Society by George Tomlinson.W.
