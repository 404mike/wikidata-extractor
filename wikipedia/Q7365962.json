Through a bad winter, the game itself was a 3rd round FA Cup replay that had been postponed many times and was eventually rescheduled to be played on a 4th round FA cup day. Because of the potential for an upset, the BBC bosses decided the game should be bumped to the top of the billing on the BBC's Match of the Day program. Described as the FA Cup's greatest ever giant killing, Motson claims it was this FA Cup upset, and the story of the season that made his bosses at the BBC decide he could be trusted with more TV matches; consequentially Motson believed because of this game he was later given a three-year deal. Motson also believed if Ronnie Radford had never scored his famous goal he would never have had a TV commentary career.

He enjoyed three years at Barnet, in what he has stated was the best team he ever played in. Memorably he scored a hat-trick in the FA Cup against Newport County, a team which contained future teammate Ronnie Radford.", "In January 1971, George was sold to Hereford United where he joined his former Hastings and Barnet teammate Billy Meadows. He took a while to find his feet at Edgar Street under manager John Charles but would soon become involved in arguably the greatest FA Cup shock of all time. Hereford met Newcastle United, of the First Division, in the Third Round at St James' Park and came away with a remarkable 2\u20132 draw. George was the substitute that day, played for the last 20 minutes and provided a cross that Meadows came within inches of converting. The replay at Edgar Street saw George named as the substitute again. When Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle 1\u20130 up late in the game, George was brought on for the injured Roger Griffiths and played a key part in Hereford's triumph. He won possession on the left wing which ultimately led to Ronnie Radford's famous equalising goal. The game went into extra time and George's fresh legs paid dividends. Controlling a pass from Dudley Tyler on the edge of the area, he turned and shot into the bottom left hand corner of the goal, sparking a pitch invasion. Along with Ronnie Radford, George has become part of FA Cup folklore and his achievement is frequently referred to, particularly in the build-up to the FA Cup Third Round."]}]}}
