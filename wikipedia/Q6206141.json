The Xenogears Original Soundtrack was released on two discs and published by DigiCube in Japan in 1998. The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a choral track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from \"a world of [his] own imagining\" rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. There are two vocal tracks included on the OST, and both are sung by Joanne Hogg. One of the tracks, \"Stars of Tears\", did not appear in the final version of the game. It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits. The scene, however, was removed for pacing issues, as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes. The other, \"Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~\", was the first ending theme with lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square.", "An arranged soundtrack of Xenogears composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as Creid. For Creid, he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in \"easy-to-listen-to\" pop tracks to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks. The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks, while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the title track, which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording. Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in Creid. Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while Eimear Quinn sang \"Creid\".

Following Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda composed the soundtrack for Front Mission: Gun Hazard, again with Uematsu. According to Uematsu, Mitsuda again worked so much that he eventually defecated blood out of stress and physical problems. Mitsuda worked on three more titles for Square: Tobal No. 1 and Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H\u014dseki both in 1996, and Xenogears in 1998, which featured the first ballad in a Square game, the Celtic ending theme \"Small Two of Pieces\" sung by Joanne Hogg.

Mitsuda initially had difficulties finding an artist that matched his vision, but eventually chose Joanne Hogg from the Celtic band Iona after stumbling upon their album The Book of Kells in a CD store and listening to the song \"Chi-Rho\". Hogg was enthusiastic in contributing as it was her first video game-related recording. She did not play the game for the project, however. Irish music was not well known in Japan at the time, but Mitsuda felt that a \"Celtic boom\" was about to hit the country. His prediction would later turn true with the popularity of the American film Titanic and the Irish stepdancing show Riverdance.", "The opening movie of the game was produced before the corresponding track \"Dark Dawn\" was, and Mitsuda had to rearrange his composition after realizing some parts were out of synch with the frames by about a minute and a half. The choral track, titled \"The Beginning and the End\", was performed by a 41-voice choir named The Great Voices of Bulgaria and features lyrics written by Tetsuya Takahashi. His lyrics were translated from Japanese to English then to Bulgarian for the recording. Joanne Hogg sang in English on \"Stars of Tears\" and \"Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~\". The latter took Mitsuda \"an awfully long amount of time\" just to compose the demo version. Masato Kato wrote the original lyrics for the two songs, and Hogg arranged them so that they would fit the melodies better and sound more Celtic. As with most of his previous soundtracks, Mitsuda composed a musical box arrangement of one of the main themes; in Xenogears' case, the track \"Distant Promise\" is the musical box version of \"Small Two of Pieces\".", "While in Ireland, Mitsuda also worked with Spillane and Maire Breatnach, another musician from Riverdance, to record an arranged album of Xenogears. Titled Creid and released in April 1998, the arranged album features 10 instrumental and vocal tracks from the soundtrack arranged in a more dominant Celtic style. \"Stars of Tears\" and \"Small Two of Pieces\" appear on the album as \"Two Wings\" and \"M\u00f6bius\" respectively, and are sung in Japanese by Tetsuko \"Techie\" Honma. A second arranged album, titled Myth: The Xenogears Orchestral Album, was released on February 23, 2011. The original soundtrack versions of \"Stars of Tears\" and \"Small Two of Pieces\" were featured on the 2001 compilation Square Vocal Collection, and again in 2009 on the compilation Colours of Light. The Xenogears soundtrack remains one of Mitsuda's favourite projects, and one of the works that he continues to feel a \"special connection\" to. For the game's 20th anniversary, a remastered version of the soundtrack titled Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc -the first and the last- was released on blu-ray on April 4, 2018.
