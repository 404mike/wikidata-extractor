When one of Bill Gibbs designs was chosen by Beatrix Miller of Vogue as the 1970 Dress of the Year, the ensemble included a Fassett hand-knitted waistcoat, showing that traditional textile handicrafts had become an acceptable aspect of mainstream fashion.

It became The Queen: The Ladies Newspaper and Court Chronicle before returning to The Queen. In 1958, the magazine was sold to Jocelyn Stevens, who dropped the prefix \"The\" and used it as his vehicle to represent the younger side of the British Establishment, sometimes referred to as the \"Chelsea Set\" under the editorial direction of Beatrix Miller. In 1964 the magazine gave birth to Radio Caroline, the first daytime commercial pirate radio station serving London, England. Stevens sold Queen in 1968. From 1970 the new publication became known as Harper's & Queen after a merger of two publications: Queen and Harper's Bazaar UK, until the name Queen was dropped altogether from the masthead. It is now known as Harper's Bazaar.", "The Queen or The Queen: The Ladies Newspaper and Court Chronicle focused on aristocratic women in society from 1862 onwards. In the late 1950s under the editorship of Beatrix Miller it was restyled to serve a younger readership that was defined by Miller in a style-sheet. According to Clement Freud, who wrote for the magazine, Beatrix Miller's targeted reader had long hair, was named \"Caroline\", had left school at age 16, was not an intellectual, but she was the sort of person that one ended up in bed with. ", "The Beatrix Miller style sheet for Caroline was given to contributing writers to the magazine because it gave authors an idea of whom they were writing for. Miller left the magazine to edit Vogue shortly after Radio Caroline went on the air and although the station changed its format when its original plan to reverse the effect of the Pilkington Report failed, the station did not change its name. Originally the radio station sounded similar to the output of the BBC but with some commercial advertising. The magazine retired the Caroline style sheet under the direction of its new editor Jocelyn Stevens himself. When the radio station moved from the Queen magazine offices, a new explanation of how and why the name \"Caroline\" came to be used by the station was offered to the public in order to divert attention away from its original source. By that time there did not seem to be any chance that the station would get a license and that the Labour Government then in power would seek to close it down as a \"pirate radio\" operation. Queen was celebrated in this period for its society column, \"Jennifer's Diary\" (written by Betty Kenward), its astrologer, \"Celeste\", a variety of edgy writers and elaborate fashion photography, in particular David Bailey\u2019s pictures of Twiggy.
