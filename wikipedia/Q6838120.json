Whilst he was known to sing at some concerts (including a rendition of \"This Guy's In Love With You\"), the only official Belle & Sebastian release with Cooke on lead vocals is \"The Monkeys Are Breaking Out of The Zoo\", from the charity compilation Colours Are Brighter.\nCooke also plays in the ska band The Amphetameanies and appeared on the 2007 Idlewild album, Make Another World. He has worked as an arranger for artists such as Franz Ferdinand, Phil Cunningham, and Jason Donovan. He is said to have had an influence on other Scottish-based bands, including Franz Ferdinand (who incidentally were given a bass guitar by Mick, leading to the formation of the band), whose members appeared in Belle & Sebastian's enigmatic early promotional photographs.\nCooke now composes music for films, theatre, and animations. He worked as composer on Boj for CBeebies, and on Zack & Quack for Nick Jr. His theatre work includes the score for Cannibal Women Of Mars which played at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Belle and Sebastian", "response": ["After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to Jeepster Records in August 1996 and If You're Feeling Sinister, their second album, was released on 18 November. The album was named by Spin as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005, and it is widely considered the band's masterpiece. Just before the recording of Sinister, Sarah Martin (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997. The first of these was Dog on Wheels, which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and Mick Cooke, who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No.\u00a059 in the UK singles chart.", "The band released their third LP, The Boy with the Arab Strap in 1998, and it reached No.\u00a012 in the UK charts.  Arab Strap garnered an NPR interview and positive reviews from Rolling Stone and the Village Voice, among others; however, the album has its detractors, including Pitchfork, who gave the album a particularly poor review, calling it a \"parody\" of their earlier work (Pitchfork has since removed the review from their website and re-reviewed the album positively in 2018). During the recording of the album, long-time studio trumpet-player Mick Cooke was asked to join the band as a full member. The This Is Just a Modern Rock Song EP followed later that year.", "In 2013, Pitchfork TV released an hour-long documentary in February, directed by RJ Bentler which focused on the band's 1996 album If You're Feeling Sinister, as well as the formation and early releases of the band. The documentary featured interviews with every member that was present on the album, as well as several archival photos and videos from the band's early days. The band compiled a second compilation album The Third Eye Centre which included the b-sides and rarities released after Push Barman to Open Old Wounds, from the albums Dear Catastrophe Waitress, The Life Pursuit, and Write About Love. In an interview at the end of 2013, Mick Cooke confirmed he had left the band on good terms.", "*The Reindeer Section were a Scottish indie rock supergroup formed in 2001 by Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, which released albums and gigged in 2001 and 2002.
