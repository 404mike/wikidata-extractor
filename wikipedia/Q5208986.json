The results meant that a win over Northern Ireland in their final game would give Wales their first Home Championship title since 1937. However, an increase in violence during The Troubles led ten of Wales' squad to refuse to travel for the match, despite assurances from Sinn F\u00e9in over safety. With England also refusing to travel, the competition was halted with no winner declared for the only time in the competition's history. Wales resumed qualifying for the 1982 World Cup by holding the Soviet Union to a goalless draw at the Racecourse with more than 29,000 spectators attending. Wales travelled to Czechoslovakia in September 1981 knowing a win would almost guarantee qualification, but an own goal by goalkeeper Dai Davies, the first goal he had conceded in more than 450 minutes of qualifying, and a second Czech goal in the second half gave Wales their first defeat of the campaign. In their next game, Wales were favourites to beat Iceland and took the lead in the first half. However, an electrical fire at Vetch Field delayed the match for more than 40 minutes with the players finishing the final minute of the first half before immediately returning to the dressing room for half time. Iceland took advantage of the disruption, equalising in the first minute of the second half and, despite Alan Curtis again giving Wales the lead, Iceland severely dented Wales' qualification hopes by securing a 2\u20132 draw.
