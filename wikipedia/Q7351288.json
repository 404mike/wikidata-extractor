Wynne-Edwards was born in Cheltenham and educated at Giggleswick School and Leeds Grammar School before being commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers at the outbreak of the First World War.  He served on the Western Front in France where he received a Mention in Despatches, Distinguished Service Order and a Military Cross and bar for his gallantry and leadership.  Following the war he studied engineering at Christ Church, Oxford from which he graduated with second class honours in 1921.\nWynne-Edwards emigrated to Canada working on several contracts in Vancouver including the Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel.  He returned to Britain in 1935 following a slump in the Canadian building industry and joined John Mowlem & Co. where he was given the task of constructing the William Girling Reservoir.  The newly constructed dam later collapsed and Wynne-Edwards enlisted the expertise of the Building Research Station and Karl von Terzaghi to prove that he was not at fault.  During the Second World War Wynne-Edwards was seconded to the Ministry of Works where he became their director of plant.\nAfter the war Wynne-Edwards was managing director of Richard Costain Ltd, specialising in pipelaying and also served on several boards and committees for the British Government.  For this latter role he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire.  Wynne-Edwards was also involved with the Institution of Civil Engineers serving on many committees and being elected their one hundredth president in 1964.  He was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Giggleswick School", "response": ["*Sir Robert Wynne-Edwards CBE, DSO, MC& Bar (1897\u20131974), British Army officer; civil engineer", "Allegedly the Three Peaks Walk was invented in July 1887 by two masters at the school: D.

The project was led by civil engineer, Robert Wynne-Edwards. Due to the use of mechanical scrapers and bulldozers, which were being used for the first time in British dam construction, progress was rapid. The design, by Sir Jonathan Roberts Davidson, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers 1948/49, attracted widespread technical interest in 1937 when a major slip occurred in the partly formed embankment at the north-west corner. When the embankment fill had reached  a  width had dropped  and moved forward . Fortunately, the dam failed before any water had been stored. Investigations were under way when a second slip occurred in December 1937. Two independent soil mechanics experts, Dr. Herbert Chatley and Professor Karl Terzaghi, were called in and both made recommendations. In July 1938 the MWB made important modifications to the original design. Subsequent investigations into this landslip can be regarded as the birth of modern soil mechanics in Britain. The reservoir was redesigned to increase its capacity by 11.3%."]}, {"page": "Robert Wynne (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Robert Wynne-Edwards (1897\u20131974), British civil engineer and army officer"]}, {"page": "Wynne-Edwards, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Wynne-Edwards"]}]}}
