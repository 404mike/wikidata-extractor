This planned long trade-route would greatly improve the economy of the Parthian Empire. In order to accomplish this, Pacorus strengthened relations with other powers whom he was able to establish long distance trade with, most notably Han China. In 97, the Chinese general Ban Chao, the Protector-General of the Western Regions, sent his emissary Gan Ying on a diplomatic mission to reach the Roman Empire. Gan visited the court of Pacorus at Hecatompylos before departing towards Rome. He traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf, where the Parthian authorities convinced him that an arduous sea voyage around the Arabian Peninsula was the only means to reach Rome. Discouraged by this, Gan Ying returned to the Han court and provided Emperor He of Han () with a detailed report on the Roman Empire based on oral accounts of his Parthian hosts. The modern historian William Watson speculated that the Parthians would have been relieved at the failed efforts by the Han Empire to open diplomatic relations with Rome, especially after Ban Chao's military victories against the Xiongnu in eastern Central Asia."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2007", "response": ["*William Watson, 89, British sinologist.William Watson"]}, {"page": "Southern School", "response": ["According to William Watson, while the Northern School contains \"the painters who favour clear, emphatic structure in their compositions, with the use of explicit perspective devices\", the Southern School \"cultivate a more intimate style of landscape bathed in cloud and mist, in which pleasing calligraphic forms tend to take the place of conventions established for the representation of rocks, trees, etc.  The painter of the Southern School was interested in distant effects, but his colleague of the Northern School paid more attention to the devices of composition which achieve the illusion of recession, and at the same time more attentive to close realism of detail. ... some artists hover between the two\".Watson, 86  A more philosophical distinction is that the Southern School painters \"were thought to have sought the inner realities and expressed their own lofty natures\" while the Northern \"painted only the outward appearance of things, the worldly and decorative\".Sickman, 334"]}, {"page": "Oriental Ceramic Society", "response": ["* 1980\u201384 Prof. William Watson"]}, {"page": "1982 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*William Watson, Professor of Chinese Art and Archaeology, University of London."]}, {"page": "Yixian glazed pottery luohans", "response": ["Luohan (often written lu\u00f3h\u00e0n) is the Chinese term for an arhat, one of the historical disciples of the Buddha. As Buddhist tradition developed, and especially in the East Asian Buddhist countries, the number of arhats or luohans tended to increase, and at least the most important were regarded as, or as almost, bodhisattvas or fully enlightened beings, with a wide range of supernatural powers.Rhie and Thurman, 102  According to Buddhist tradition, groups of 16, 18 or 500 luohans awaited the arrival of Maitreya, the Future Buddha, and groups were often used in East Asian Buddhist art. The full set of the so called \"Yixian luohans\" is thought by most scholars to have had figures for the typical Chinese main grouping of Sixteen or Eighteen Arhats, although William Watson describes this \"usual assumption\" as \"speculative\". These and earlier smaller groupings of six or eight were each given names and personalities in Buddhist tradition.Rhie and Thurman, 102\u2013116; Wisdom, 112\u2013114; Steinhardt, 7\u20138; Gillman, 126; Watson, 123, quoted", "To a surprising degree, the number of surviving pieces differs between sources.  Most older sources say there were eight, including the Berlin figure. Three of these, those in Boston, Japan and Ontario, are reported to have later heads.Gillman, 126 n This may explain why William Watson in 2000 wrote that \"Five Luohan in sancai pottery are preserved in Western museums\", presumably excluding the example in Japan. The group of nine as listed by Laurence Sickman and others includes the examples from Berlin (as \"present location unknown\") and Japan (as \"Matsukata Collection\") but excludes the one now in Paris.Sickman, 483, note 11  By 2010 Gillman says what is presumably the same Japanese example was in the \"Saizon Museum of Modern Art\" (more usually \"Sezon\").Gillman, 126n"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 1970s", "response": ["* Professor William Watson"]}]}}
