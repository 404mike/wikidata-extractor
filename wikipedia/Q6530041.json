In one of these matches (the first episode of Superstars), Foley and Les Thornton (another jobber) faced the British Bulldogs, during which the Dynamite Kid (who had a long earned reputation as a stiff worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, pp. 82\u201385 During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talents at the time, such as Hercules Hernandez.

He was also involved in heated backstage fights with Jacques Rougeau, one of which led to Rougeau hitting him with a fistful of quarters as he opened a door holding a cup of coffee, knocking several of his teeth out. Billington claimed the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove him to leave the WWF, but rather a dispute with WWF management over the issuance of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and which to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit."]}, {"page": "Don Muraco", "response": ["Muraco returned to the WWF in 1985, managed by Mr. Fuji.
