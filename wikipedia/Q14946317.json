G. Boulenger was a British zoologist and longtime director of the London Zoo aquarium.\nBoulenger was the son of herpetologist and ichthyologist George Albert Boulenger. He was educated at St. Paul's School, and became curator at the reptile house in London Zoo in 1911, a position he held for 13 years. During World War I he served as an observer in the balloon section of the Royal Flying Corps. In 1924 he became director of the newly opened seawater and freshwater aquarium of the Zoological Society of London, whose design and construction he had actively supported since 1921. In 1943 he resigned from his directorship.\nLike his father, Boulenger was fluent in both French and German. This benefited him when he made several trips to mainland Europe to make new acquisitions for the reptile house and the aquarium. Furthermore, Boulenger worked as an author.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Albert Boulenger", "response": ["His son, Edward George Boulenger (1888\u20131946), was also a zoologist and held the post of Director of the London Zoo Aquarium."]}, {"page": "Boulenger", "response": ["* Edward George Boulenger (1888\u20131946), British zoologist, director of aquarium at London Zoo "]}, {"page": "Mark Barr", "response": ["With Edward George Boulenger of the London Zoo, he built a timer-operated electromechanical rat trap."]}, {"page": "Chinese giant salamander", "response": ["A 2018 study of mitochondrial DNA revealed that there are five wild clades of the Chinese giant salamander, as well as two only known from captives (their possible wild range is unknown).

Despite this deep divergence, they can hybridize among each other, and also with the Japanese giant salamander. One of these clades was identified in 2019 as Andrias sligoi, a species described in 1924 by Edward George Boulenger and later synonymized with A. davidianus, with the study supporting its revival as a distinct taxon.

This individual was originally held in the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens and may have originated from Guangxi or Guangdong Province, and was likely one of many giant salamanders captured from the mainland and placed in the Botanical Gardens' fountain, all of which had escaped. During a particularly violent storm in April 1920, a large drain pipe in the Gardens burst, carving a large depression into the land that the escaped salamander was washed into. It was captured and kept in a large circular basin, where it was fed daily with live tadpoles and occasionally beef."]}]}}
