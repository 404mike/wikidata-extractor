He resigned from The Football Association in December 1998, along with chairman Keith Wiseman, when a scandal broke out over an allegedly improper loan of \u00a33.2 million, from the FA to the Football Association of Wales (FAW).It was alleged that the loan was intended to buy the FAW\u2019s support for the election of Wiseman as a vice president for FIFA, which would in turn help England\u2019s bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was ultimately unsuccessful as the event was awarded to Germany in July 2000.

The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld, a claim strenuously denied by Shearer."]}, {"page": "Hillsborough disaster", "response": ["The FA chief executive Graham Kelly, who had attended the match, said the FA would conduct an inquiry into what had happened. Speaking after the disaster, Kelly backed all-seater stadiums, saying \"We must move fans away from the ritual of standing on terraces\". Standing on terraces and the use of perimeter fencing around the pitch, the use of CCTV, the timing of football matches and policing of sporting events were factors for a subsequent inquiry to consider."]}, {"page": "Eric Cantona", "response": ["Cantona then got up from his seat and abruptly left, leaving behind him a packed media room surprised and baffled \u2013 some roared with laughter \u2013 with those in the room trying to decipher his cryptic words.

He was also stripped of the captaincy of the French national football team by national coach Aim\u00e9 Jacquet. The FA then increased the ban to eight months (up to and including 30 September 1995) and fined him a further \u00a310,000. The FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly described his attack as \"a stain on our game\" that brought shame on football. FIFA then confirmed the suspension as worldwide, meaning that Cantona could not escape the ban by being transferred or loaned to a foreign club. Cantona never played for the French national team again.

He also reduced the average age of the FA's staff from 55 to 32, progressed the Wembley Stadium redevelopment, and reduced the FA's ruling body from a 91-member FA Board to a committee of 12.
