Ray Illingworth won the toss and decided to field, but rain began to fall before the teams went out and after three days of continuous rain the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Desperate attempts to dry the boggy outfield were made by Ian Johnson and the MCG ground staff, who claimed that \"if the match had been in England the teams would have played. The outfield was good, the wicket firm and bowlers' run-ups safe\". Each day they announced that play would be able to start \"as soon as the rain stopped\" to encourage spectators to come to the ground.p 90-91, Snow One English writer said that the 8,000 people who arrived on the Thursday would have 'gladly paid a dollar each to permit the M.C.G. to buy a proper cover'.p 115, Whitington Sir Cyril Hawker, President of the MCC, and Gubby Allen, the treasurer, happened to be in Melbourne and with David Clark arranged the historic One Day International for the fifth day with Sir Donald Bradman and the Australian Board of Control. They also cancelled the second tour match between Victoria and the MCC so that an extra Test could be played. Ray Illingworth and the England players were not consulted and only found out when Bradman came into the dressing room to thank them for their co-operation.p 89, Snow The players had severe misgivings about this state of affairs as the extra Test might cost them the Ashes and cancelled one of their rest days. They now had only five rest days in the last six weeks of the tour, and these included official receptions and engagements. There was also the question of pay and it was several weeks before Clark was able to grant an extra \u00a3100, long after the Australians had agreed a pay deal with their team.p 90, Snow"]}, {"page": "1958 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Frank Cyril Hawker, Director, Bank of England."]}, {"page": "Sir Cyril Hawker", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Hawker"]}]}}
