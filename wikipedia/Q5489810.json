He made more than 250 appearances in the Football League playing for Burslem Port Vale and Small Heath / Birmingham between 1898 and 1910. In between these two spells he spent 1901 to 1903 at Reading, and helped the club to finish second in the Southern League in the 1902\u201303 season.

He and two other Liverpool players were banned from football for six months in 1903 for \"accepting illegal financial inducements\" from Southern League club Portsmouth to sign for them.
