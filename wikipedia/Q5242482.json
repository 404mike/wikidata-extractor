Katie Edwards, a British author and academic, said in The Independent that such criticism was based on anti-gay tropes and the \"villainisation of gay male sexuality\", whereby two men kissing is seen as an inherently sexual act or behaviour, but a man and a woman kissing is not, as it is considered the norm by society.
