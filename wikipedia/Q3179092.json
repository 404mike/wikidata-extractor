He started his playing career in 1949 at Third Division Southport, before being transferred to Manchester City in March 1951 for \u00a35,000. He made his only appearance for England against Scotland in April 1955, but the following month suffered a serious injury in the 17th minute of the 1955 FA Cup Final, going for an attempted tackle by his own corner flag. As substitutes were not allowed in the English game until 1965\u201366, City had to play the rest of the game with ten players resulting in Newcastle United winning 3\u20131. Meadows' injury was so serious he was forced to retire from playing, and moved into management.His longest managerial appointment was a 2+1\u20442-year spell at Stockport County in the late 1960s, and he returned there for a season in 1974. In between, he had a bizarre 81-day spell in charge of Bolton Wanderers in 1971 as team manager under general manager Nat Lofthouse. This spell saw the club virtually condemned to their first-ever period in the Third Division. He returned to Southport as manager in 1971, with whom he had his most successful period in management. He took them to the 1972\u201373 Fourth Division championship with 62 points, a feat which Bill Shankly described at the time as tougher and more meritorious than his own championship with Liverpool that same year.Other clubs he served included GIF Sundsvall and two spells at Blackpool. During his first period as Blackpool's caretaker manager in 1970, Meadows appeared alongside Jimmy Armfield and Glyn James as the \"Blackpool\" team versus \"Crystal Palace\" in the popular television show Quiz Ball.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["As quickly as Shannon had taken Blackpool up, he saw them return whence they came. The club finished at the foot of the table and were relegated back to Division Two, along with Burnley. Before the season's conclusion, Shannon was briefly replaced by Jimmy Meadows as caretaker manager, who in turn was permanently replaced by Bob Stokoe. On 12 June 1971, well over a month after the conclusion of the League season, Blackpool won the Anglo-Italian Cup with a 2\u20131 victory over Bologna in the final. This was achieved without the services of Jimmy Armfield, who retired in May after 17 years and 627 appearances for the club."]}, {"page": "Bert Trautmann", "response": ["Using the Revie Plan, Manchester City reached the 1955 FA Cup Final, in which Trautmann became the first German to play in an FA Cup final. City faced Newcastle United, winners of the cup in 1951 and 1952. Nerves affected the City players, and they went behind to a Jackie Milburn goal after only 45\u00a0seconds. Further problems were caused by the loss of Jimmy Meadows to injury after 18\u00a0minutes, leaving City with 10\u00a0men,James, Manchester City\u00a0\u2013 The Complete Record, p. 49. a disadvantage that meant Trautmann's ability to start attacks from throws was limited. Though Bobby Johnstone equalised in the first half, they struggled in the second, and after 57\u00a0minutes Trautmann was outwitted by Bobby Mitchell, who scored Newcastle's second goal.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p. 168. The match finished as a 3\u20131 defeat for City, giving Trautmann a runners-up medal."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953\u201354 season, but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954\u201355 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5\u20130 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign fell away but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3\u20131 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At the end of the season Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year."]}, {"page": "Southport F.C.", "response": ["* Jimmy Meadows\u00a0\u2013 England international"]}, {"page": "Charlie Hurley", "response": ["On 2 June 1969, Charlie moved to Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. He spent three years at Burnden Park and was a well-liked figure in the heart of the defence, so much so that he was given the opportunity to manage the club upon the departure of Jimmy Meadows only to reluctantly turn the chance down because his wife missed living in the South of England."]}, {"page": "GIF Sundsvall", "response": ["* Jimmy Meadows (1976)"]}]}}
