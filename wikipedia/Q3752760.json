Oxford University Press, 2011. p.24 The idea was promoted by French as well as by Frederick Shaw, Commander of the British Army in Ireland. The RIC's Inspector General, Joseph Byrne, was against it. He resisted the militarization of the police and believed ex-soldiers could not be controlled by police discipline. In December 1919, Byrne was replaced by his deputy T. J. Smith, an Orangeman. On 27 December, Smith issued an order authorizing recruitment in Britain. The advertisements appeared in major cities calling for men willing to \"face a rough and dangerous task\". The first British recruits joined the RIC six days later, on 2 January 1920."]}, {"page": "13th (Western) Division", "response": ["| Lt.Gen. Rt.Hon.

During a Cabinet meeting on 11 May 1920, the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, suggested the formation of a \"Special Emergency Gendarmerie, which would become a branch of the Royal Irish Constabulary\".  Churchill's proposal was referred to a committee chaired by General Sir Nevil Macready, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Ireland.  Macready's committee rejected Churchill's proposal, but it was revived two months later, in July, by the Police Adviser to the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland, Major-General H H Tudor.  In a memo dated 6 July 1920, Tudor justified the scheme on the grounds that it would take too long to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) with ordinary recruits.  Tudor's new \"Auxiliary Force\" would be strictly temporary: its members would enlist for a year: their pay would be \u00a37 per week (twice what a constable was paid), plus a sergeant's allowances, and would be known as \"Temporary Cadets\". At this time a London advertisement for ex-officers to manage coffee stalls at two pounds ten shillings a week received five thousand applicants."]}, {"page": "Gloucestershire Regiment", "response": ["* 1921 Lieutenant-General Right Honourable Sir Frederick Shaw KCB"]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Ireland", "response": ["*Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Shaw 1918\u20131920"]}, {"page": "Lords Justices of Ireland", "response": ["| Frederick Shaw"]}, {"page": "F.
