Saccharum barberi, a species of sugarcane that grows wild in northern India is named after him. He was a pioneer in the nobilization of wild canes in India, by producing hybrids between wild and hardy local species and the high-sugar-yielding cultivated Saccharum officinarum that could survive the cold winters of northern India.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Taliparamba", "response": ["The District Agricultural Farm at Karimbam is a major research organization in Taliparamba.
