Born in Cardiff, he joined hometown side Cardiff City in 1925, initially as an amateur before turning professional a year later. He made his senior debut in 1926 and helped the side win both the FA Cup and Welsh Cup in his first season. In the club's 1927 FA Cup victory, he became the youngest player to appear in a final in the competition's history as Cardiff defeated Arsenal, remaining the only team from outside England to win the trophy. \nCurtis was sold to Birmingham in 1928 where he went on to make more than 160 appearances in all competitions during a five-year spell. He reached a second FA Cup final in 1931 but was on the losing side. He returned to Cardiff in 1933 but became involved in a wage dispute with the club and never featured for the side again. Eventually Coventry City secured his release in 1935 and he helped the side win promotion to the Second Division the following year. He finished his career with Hartlepools United where he spent one year before retiring. During his career he made over 250 appearances in the Football League and won 3 caps for the Wales national side. \nDuring World War II, Curtis served in the 77th Division of the 2nd Welsh Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, but was captured in Java in 1941. He spent the rest of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp. He later worked as a trainer for Cardiff before becoming a publican.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Baker (footballer, born 1920)", "response": ["Baker joined the 77th HAA Regiment, which contained a number of footballers including other Cardiff City players Ernie Curtis and Billy James and embarked on a journey to North Africa by ship for deployment. However, en route, Japanese forces launched an attack on Pearl Harbor, leading the UK to declare war against Japan which saw Baker and his unit rerouted to Java where British forces suffered heavy losses and Baker was one of numerous British troops taken prisoner."]}, {"page": "Fred Keenor", "response": ["Described as possessing a \"terrible\" shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, Keenor's strength lay in his commitment and uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for more than 15 years at Cardiff City said, \"I honestly do not believe the word 'beaten' is in his vocabulary.\" Former teammate, Ernie Curtis said of him: \"He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty but he was just hard. Nobody took liberties with old Fred\u00a0... [He] could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball mind you, but he could run all day\". Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having \"a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal\". His hard-tackling style made him a target for opposition fans; he was once assaulted following a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans."]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C.", "response": ["The following season was the first time Cardiff appeared at Wembley Stadium, having reached their first FA Cup final. The team lost 1\u20130 to Sheffield United following a goal from England international Fred Tunstall. The 1926\u201327 season, when they finished in 14th position, was Cardiff's worst performance in the top tier of English Football since winning promotion six seasons before. However, they reached their second FA Cup final in the space of two years. On St George's Day, 23 April 1927, at Wembley Stadium in London, Cardiff became the only non-English side to win the FA Cup by defeating Arsenal 1\u20130 in the final; Hughie Ferguson scored the only goal of the game in the 74th minute. He received the ball from Ernie Curtis and hurried a tame shot toward the goal; Dan Lewis, the Arsenal goalkeeper, allowed the shot to slip through his grasp and knocked the ball into the net with his elbow. Captain Fred Keenor received the FA Cup trophy at the end of the match from King George V only seven years after Cardiff City had entered the Football League. When the team returned to Cardiff the next day, a crowd of around 150,000 people lined the streets to welcome them."]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Cardiff City began its campaign for the 1926\u201327 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against fellow Football League First Division side Aston Villa in January 1927. After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa managed to reply just once, when Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff were drawn against Football League Second Division side Darlington. Newspaper reports indicated that Cardiff were the better team, and had it not been for the success of Darlington's defence they would have won by a greater margin. The goals were scored by George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.", "Cardiff City prepared for the final at Southport, Lancashire, at the Palace Hotel where the squad had stayed ahead of previous rounds. The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On the day before the match, they travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the press about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Hardy and Cardiff's defence were seen as a key part of the team's chances; ahead of the match, Buchan described them as \"an impassable barrier\". Cardiff were almost free to choose their first choice team. The only omission was Harry Wake who had suffered damage to his kidneys in a league match against Sheffield Wednesday a week before the final. Other than Wake, their team was the same as that which played Reading in the semi-final. Ernie Curtis was selected as his replacement, becoming at the age of 19 the youngest player at the time to feature in an FA Cup final. Tom Farquharson, Jimmy Nelson, Fred Keenor and Billy Hardy had played in the 1925 final defeat.", "| || Ernie Curtis", "Less than a fortnight later, Cardiff beat Rhyl 2\u20130 in the final of the Welsh Cup to claim an unprecedented transnational cup double. Cardiff also qualified for 1927 FA Charity Shield, defeating amateur team Corinthian by two goals to one with the winning goal once again by Ferguson. They also adopted triangular corner flags to commemorate the win. Ferguson returned to his native Scotland two years later, joining Dundee. He sank into depression after struggling to find form and committed suicide less than three years after his winning goal in the 1927 final. Cardiff's fortunes declined quickly afterwards. Within four years of the final, they had been relegated to the Football League Third Division South. Keenor remained captain during this period, and left the club after 19 years to transfer to Crewe Alexandra during the 1930\u201331 season. In 1934, Cardiff slipped further and were required to petition the Football Association to allow them to remain in the league after they finished last and were eligible to be removed from the competition. Cardiff's Ernie Curtis, who died in November 1992 at the age of 85, was the last surviving player from the final. He had been the youngest player in the match, aged 19 years and 317 days. Cardiff reached the FA Cup Final once more in 2008, where they lost by one goal to nil against Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "Bartley Wilson", "response": ["The team's struggles also affected the club  financially and Wilson was one of several staff members forced to take a pay cut of 20 percent in April 1932.

Wilson appointed former club captain Jimmy Blair as a coach but the club were severely limited financially. His most significant signing ahead of the new season was the return of Ernie Curtis, part of the 1927 FA Cup winning side, for \u00a31,250. Wilson's time in charge proved disastrous and the club was bottom of the Third Division South at the season's mid-point in January. This was followed by five defeats in the following six matches and, on 7 March 1934, Wilson resigned his position to be replaced by Ben Watts-Jones. Wilson instead returned to his administrative role within the club. A Western Mail reporter did however offer support to Wilson, writing that the manager had \"been unduly handicapped in his duties because the directors have taken too strong a grip on the managerial side instead of allowing the manager to manage\"."]}, {"page": "Hughie Ferguson", "response": ["Having featured at inside right in all rounds leading up to the final, Ferguson was switched to centre-forward for the deciding match.
