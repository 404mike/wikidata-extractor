The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the rest of their marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of \u00a325,000 from Bentinck's brothers Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield.Blake (1967), pp. 251\u2013254"]}, {"page": "Hughenden Manor", "response": ["After passing through his extended family following a series of deaths and resultant will bequests, by 1816 the manor and lands were owned by John Norris, a distinguished antiquary and scholar.
