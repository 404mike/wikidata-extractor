Harrison began his career on the stage in 1924. He made his West End debut in 1936 appearing in the Terence Rattigan play French Without Tears, in what was his breakthrough role. He won his first Tony Award for his performance as Henry VIII in the play Anne of the Thousand Days in 1949. He won his second Tony for the role of Professor Henry Higgins in the stage production of My Fair Lady in 1957.\nIn addition to his stage career, Harrison also appeared in numerous films. His first starring role was opposite Vivien Leigh in the romantic comedy Storm in a Teacup (1937). Receiving critical acclaim for his performance in Major Barbara (1941), which was shot in London during the Blitz, his roles since then included Blithe Spirit (1945), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), Cleopatra (1963), My Fair Lady (1964), reprising his role as Henry Higgins which earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the titular character in Doctor Dolittle (1967).\nIn 1975, Harrison released his first autobiography. In June 1989, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He was married six times and had two sons: Noel and Carey Harrison. He continued working in stage productions until shortly before his death from pancreatic cancer in June 1990 at the age of 82. His second autobiography, A Damned Serious Business: My Life in Comedy, was published posthumously in 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Jay Lerner", "response": ["In 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled My Fair Lady.

Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz first tried, and then Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner, \"Pygmalion had no subplot\". Lerner and Loewe's adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, played originally by Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.

He was uncharacteristically able to complete \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" from My Fair Lady in one 24-hour period. He usually spent months on each song and was constantly rewriting them.

The casting of Audrey Hepburn instead of Julie Andrews as Eliza was controversial, partly because theatregoers regarded Andrews as perfect for the part and partly because Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed (by Marni Nixon). Jack L. Warner, the head of Warner Bros., which produced the film, wanted \"a star with a great deal of name recognition\", but since Andrews did not have any film experience, he thought it would be more successful to cast a movie star.Roman, James W. \"My Fair Lady\" Bigger Than Blockbusters: Movies That Defined America, ABC-CLIO, 2009, , pp. 125\u2013126. (Andrews went on to star in Mary Poppins that same year for which she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actress.) Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart's original direction. He was also unhappy with the casting of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and that the film was shot in its entirety at the Warner Bros. studio rather than, as he would have preferred, in London.Lerner, The Street Where I Live pp 134\u20136.

Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals.

Glenn Miller's \"The Lady's in Love with You\" and \"The Little Man Who Wasn't There\" (both 1939), each contain distinctly rap-like sequences set to a driving beat as does the 1937 song \"Doin' the Jive\". In musical theater, the term \"vamp\" is identical to its meaning in jazz, gospel, and funk, and it fulfills the same function. Semi-spoken music has long been especially popular in British entertainment, and such examples as David Croft's theme to the 1970s sitcom Are You Being Served? have elements indistinguishable from modern rap."]}, {"page": "Saladin", "response": ["* King Richard and the Crusaders \u2013 Saladin's role was played by Rex Harrison."]}, {"page": "1964", "response": ["* October 21 \u2013 The film version of the hit Broadway stage musical My Fair Lady premieres in New York City.
