He moved with his mother to Lagos and then to Port Harcourt, where he lived with his maternal grandfather, David Ayodele Hughes, the superintendent of the United Native African Church mission.  He studied at the Hope Waddell Training Institute in Calabar before returning to Ibadan where he trained as a schoolteacher.  He then worked in Lagos, and, after his mother's death, adopted her family name of Hughes. He began playing guitar in Lagos bars in the evenings, meeting fellow musician Ambrose Campbell and performing with him in the Jolly Boys Orchestra (or Jolly Orchestra).", "In 1939 he left Nigeria and joined the British Merchant Navy as a stoker, using the name Ernest Henley Hughes and acquiring the nickname \"Brewster\". He settled in Manchester and worked as a fitter in an aircraft factory before moving to London, where he met up again with Ambrose Campbell. When Campbell was assaulted by racist thugs at a London underground station, Hughes shot one of the assailants, and was imprisoned for 15 months as a result. After his release in 1946, he and Campbell, with other musicians, formed a band, the West African Rhythm Brothers, initially to accompany a ballet company, Les Ballets N\u00e8gres, who toured the UK. The group established a residency at the Abalabi club in Soho in 1952, playing a mixture of palm-wine and j\u00f9j\u00fa music but increasingly absorbing calypso and mento influences from musicians newly arriving from the Caribbean.  With Campbell on vocals and Hughes on guitar, other members of the group included trumpeter Harry Beckett, saxophonist Willy Roachford, pianist Adam Fiberesima, and bongo player Ade Bashorun.  According to writer Val Wilmer:While Campbell was credited as the group's leader, Hughes's role was important. He played an amplified instrument, sometimes in a harsh, attacking style, and his confident, boisterous singing made a welcome contrast to Campbell's gentler, more diffident manner. As a more than competent guitarist with an affinity to jazz, he often provided the group's musical impetus and direction, and as the Nigerian highlife made inroads into the consciousness of Londoners in the early 1950s Hughes acted as spokesman for the group, spelling out their philosophy and aims."]}, {"page": "Oladipupo Adekoya Campbell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ambrose Campbell"]}, {"page": "Leon Live", "response": ["*Ambrose Campbell - congas, drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "One for the Road (Willie Nelson and Leon Russell album)", "response": ["*Ambrose Campbell \tPercussion"]}, {"page": "Hank Wilson, Vol. II", "response": ["*The Band: Trudy Fair, John \"Juke\" Logan, Billy West, Bob Britt, Jack Wessel, Shamsi Sarumi and Ambrose Campbell "]}, {"page": "Solid State (Leon Russell album)", "response": ["*Percussion \u2013 Ambrose Campbell (tracks: B1, B4), Shamsi Sarumi (tracks: B4)"]}, {"page": "Rhythm & Bluegrass: Hank Wilson, Vol. 4", "response": ["* Ambrose Campbell \u2013 percussion"]}]}}
