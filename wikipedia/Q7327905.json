He has also held a number of significant positions within the British archaeological community. He was  director of the Council for British Archaeology from 1991-1999, and was Commissioner of English Heritage.Morris studied English at Oxford University before proceeding to study music at the University of York, until he finally decided to go into archaeology as an academic vocation. His first book, Cathedrals and Abbeys of England and Wales, was published in 1979, and would be followed by two others on the same subject over the following decade, The Church in British Archaeology (1983) and Churches in the Landscape (1989). Morris then published three books on the role of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, Guy Gibson (1994), Cheshire: The Biography of Leonard Cheshire VC OM (2000) and Breaching the German Dams (co-authored with Robert Owen, 2008), before returning to the topic of landscape archaeology with Time's Anvil: England, Archaeology and the Imagination (2012) and The Archaeology of English Battlefields: Conflict in the Pre-industrial Landscape (co-authored with Glenn Foard, 2012). Time's Anvil was longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2013.
