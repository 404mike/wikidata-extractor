He received a major retrospective in 1997 at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, attended by 42,000 visitors. In his obituary of Lenkiewicz, art critic David Lee observed: \"Robert's greatest gift was to show us that an artist could be genuinely concerned about social and domestic issues and attempt the difficult task of expressing this conscience through the deeply unfashionable medium of figurative painting. In that sense, he was one of few serious painters of contemporary history.\" Lenkiewicz, aged 60, died of a heart attack in 2002. Despite his prolific output, he had only \u00a312 cash in his possession (allegedly having never opened a bank account), and owed \u00a32 million to various creditors. Since his death, examples of his best paintings have fetched six figure sums in London auction rooms."]}, {"page": "Turner Prize", "response": ["*The art critic David Lee has argued that since the re-organisation of the prize in 1991 the shortlist has been dominated by artists represented by a small number of London dealers, namely Nicholas Logsdail of the Lisson Gallery, and others closely linked to the collector Charles Saatchi: Jay Jopling, Maureen Paley and Victoria Miro.
