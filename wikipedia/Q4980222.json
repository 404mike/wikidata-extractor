There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running."]}, {"page": "Geoff Lomax", "response": ["The 1955 season saw Somerset recruit a new fast-medium bowler, Bryan Lobb. Lomax's bowling was used less, and he took only 19 wickets at the high cost of 56.47 runs per wicket. As a batsman he was again useful in the late middle order, totalling 892 runs for an average of 21.23; his highest score for the season was just 71. Somerset remained at the bottom of the County Championship table in both of Lomax's first two seasons with the team. Somerset improved to 15th (out of 17) in 1956, but Lomax's performances remained very similar: an aggregate of 960 runs at 19.59 and just 17 wickets at 67.46. His highest score was 99 in the match against Cambridge University, when he put on 177 in 116 minutes for the sixth-wicket with Harold Stephenson, setting a new Somerset record for a sixth wicket partnership in a first-class match. After this match, Lomax was promoted to open the innings for much of the rest of the season, though he moved down the order again in August when the amateur Dennis Silk was available to open."]}, {"page": "Ken Biddulph", "response": ["Biddulph gained a more regular place in the first team in 1958 as the deputy for regular fast-medium bowler Bryan Lobb, playing in almost half the matches as Somerset finished third in the County Championship, the county's highest position since 1892. In his first match of the season, against Kent at Dartford, he took six second-innings wickets for 64 runs, his best career performance to that date. He improved that performance later in the season in the home match against Worcestershire at Taunton, when he and Bill Alley took all the wickets as Worcestershire were dismissed for 68; Biddulph's share was six for 34."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Bryan Lobb", "|align=left|Bryan Lobb"]}, {"page": "John Harris (English cricketer)", "response": ["As a player, Harris was a lower-order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in May 1952 aged just 16 years and three months, the youngest cricketer ever to play for the county; he did not take a wicket in his first match but scored 18 out of a ninth wicket partnership of 48 with Bertie Buse. There were two further matches in 1953 before Harris disappeared from first-class cricket for three years on National Service. When his cricket career resumed with five matches in 1957, he made useful runs from the lower order, with a career-highest of 41 in the match against Worcestershire. But he still struggled for wickets in a Somerset side that, unlike the year of the debut, 1952, now had several options in fast and medium-paced bowling with the recruitment of Bill Alley, Ken Palmer, Bryan Lobb, Ken Biddulph and Geoff Lomax. He did not play at all in Somerset's successful season of 1958 but returned for seven games in 1959. These included his best bowling performance, three wickets for 29 runs against Worcestershire. But at the end of the season although his contract had a further year to go Harris retired due to an injury and a job offer as a coach with Framlingham College, Suffolk."]}, {"page": "Tom Dickinson (cricketer)", "response": ["He was appointed Head of Maths at Queen's College, Taunton. During the summer holidays in August 1957 he played in five consecutive matches for Somerset. In his first match, against Glamorgan, he took five wickets for 36 in the first innings, sharing all 10 wickets in the innings with Bryan Lobb, who took five for 63. In the following match, he was again Somerset's most successful bowler against a full-strength Surrey side heading for its sixth consecutive County Championship: he took four for 80, though Surrey won the match. But after taking 17 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, he did not appear in first-class matches again, though he played for Somerset's second eleven in Minor Counties matches in the school holidays in 1958."]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bryan Lobb (1953) : B.
