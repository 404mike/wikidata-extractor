Her father was a landscape gardener; her mother an amateur singer. She left school at 15 (common in the UK in those days). At first she trained as a telephone operator, but after a few bands had her sing for them locally, she quit the telephone job to sing professionally.\nShe auditioned twice for the BBC before making her first broadcast, in 1954. She recorded a number of records, only one of which charted, \"Arrivederci Darling\" in 1956, which made it to No. 19 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1957 she participated in the UK qualifying heat for the Eurovision Song Contest.

He was originally expected to report to Winchester Barracks, where he was due to join the King's Royal Rifle Corps on 7 July 1958, but his call-up was initially deferred until contractual commitments had been completed. When he finally did go in, it was so badly handled by the press (who filmed and publicised his arrival at the barracks) that after two months Dene had to be discharged on psychological grounds as his mental health had deteriorated considerably. By that time the press had almost ruined his career, and the Army offered him a pension as a form of compensation which Dene refused. Dene later joined the Larry Parnes' stable of stars and toured with them around Britain.", "Dene married his fellow pop singer Edna Savage in 1958. They later divorced.
