Whilst reading Natural Sciences as an undergraduate at St Johns College, University of Cambridge, Sach was contacted by the Christian Union who challenged him to think about whether or not the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a historical fact or not. He eventually concluded that it was, and became a Christian.

He published three scientific papers on auditory spatial attention.He then worked for St Helen's Bishopsgate in London for three years.
