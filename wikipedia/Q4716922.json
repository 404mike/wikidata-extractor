As a demonstration of this, over 700 boys were given trials with the club. Centre-half John Nicholson made a club record 208 consecutive appearances before being dropped in favour of Terry Alcock. This unsettled Nicholson, who was soon sold to Doncaster Rovers for \u00a35,000. That money was spent on bringing former Northern Ireland international Jimmy Hill to Vale Park. In a nod to the youth policy, in one game four teenagers made their d\u00e9buts: Alex Donald, Roddy Georgeson, Mick Cullerton and Paul Ogden. At the age of 15 years 347 days, Malcolm MacKenzie made his debut against Newport County on 12 April 1966, the youngest player ever to play for the club. The club finished just two points away from re-election, in 19th position, they could hardly sink any deeper.

By November 1966 he had become a regular in the first team and was the 1966\u201367 season as the club's top scorer with 12 goals. On 22 August 1967, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over  Chester in the League Cup, only to hand in a transfer request to manager Stanley Matthews the following month. He remained at the club however, and scored another hat-trick in a 4\u20132 win over Swansea Town on 20 April 1968. Of an outspoken nature, he lost his first team place after vocally criticizing manager Gordon Lee in the dressing room.

Matthews announced his policy of 'attracting and nurturing young footballers' and stressed the need for 'patience'. Matthews did not receive and did not request a contract. Though a massive lift for the club at the time, this development transpired to be a negative one for all involved, as Roy Sproson later explained that 'the club had their priorities wrong and the first team suffered badly, whilst Stan trusted people, who took advantage of him'. Most of the summer signings were youngsters, which also suited the club's directors, who had overseen massive losses over the past two seasons. In came Brian Taylor (\u00a33,000 from Shrewsbury Town); winger Roger Smith (Walsall); Scottish inside-forwards John Cummings and Tommy Morrison (Aberdeen); as well as sixteen-year-old Scottish trialist winger Alex Donald.

On the pitch results continued to go against the Vale, as they found themselves in a re-election struggle by January. Vale then went on a club-record six consecutive away games without scoring a goal in a run lasting from 8 January to 9 March. In came left-back John Ritchie from Whitley Bay, though free agent Graham Barnett did not return to the club, despite protestations from supporters \u2013 the management stated that Barnett's wage demands were too great.
