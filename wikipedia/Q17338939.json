He penned letters describing the British victory, intended for public consumption.  When this news reached the capitals of Europe, King George was happy, and the Comte de Vergennes was not, as the news effectively scuttled an early proposal for French entry into the war.  British diplomats increased pressure on the French and Spanish, demanding that they close their ports to American shipping.  While this demand was refused, it markedly increased the tensions between the powers.  The news was also harshly received by Congress and the American public, including slanders that St. Clair and Schuyler had been bribed.Nickerson (1967), pp. 161\u201362", "On July 10 Burgoyne issued orders for the next series of movements.  Most of the army was to take the rough road from Skenesboro to Fort Edward via Fort Anne, while the heavy artillery was to be transported down Lake George to Fort Edward.  Riedesel's troops were sent back up the road toward Castleton, primarily as a diversion intended to suggest that he might be aiming for the Connecticut River.Nickerson (1967), p. 160-61  Burgoyne's decision to move the army overland via Fort Anne was a curious one, for it contradicted his own earlier commentaries on planning the expedition, in which he presciently observed that defenders could easily block the route.  His decision appears to have been motivated by two factors; the first being the perception that moving the army over water via Lake George would require a retrograde movement that could be perceived as a retreat, and the second being the influence of Philip Skene, whose property would benefit by the improved road Burgoyne would have to build.Ketchum (1997), p. 240"]}, {"page": "Friedrich Adolf Riedesel", "response": ["General Riedesel was put in command of all GermanRiedesel's soldiers are mistakenly referred to as \"Hessians\" by some Americans, but were correctly identified as Brunswickers by their contemporaries. and American Indian forces during the Saratoga campaign of 1777.  His letters to the Duke of Brunswick reveal discontent with British Generals Burgoyne and Howe.  One example of Riedesel's disagreements with Burgoyne came after his victory at the Battle of Hubbardton, when rebels under Seth Warner gathered to attack loyalists under Philip Skene at Castle Town, Vermont.  General Riedesel had promised protection to the loyalists, and wanted to attack the rebels at once.  Burgoyne stalled, however, and ordered Riedesel to continue his advance instead of stopping to fight Warner's militia.Ketchum, 235-237  General Riedesel warned the Duke of Brunswick that even if the campaign went well, they could not hope to be back to Germany in 1778.Eelking, 271-272"]}, {"page": "Capture of Fort Ticonderoga", "response": ["Troops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene's schooner Katherine and several bateaux at Skenesboro.Smith (1907), p. 155Morrissey (2000), p. 10  Arnold rechristened the schooner .

By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake.  Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean.
