The merged channel launched on 1 February 1998 and was named CNBC Asia Business News but it was simply referred to as CNBC Asia in mid-1998. As a result of the merger, there were massive employee lay-offs and programme cancellations at CNBC's Asia original headquarters in Hong Kong (which since has been took over by rival channel Bloomberg Television for its Asia Pacific operations) but Rico Hizon, Geoff Cutmore and Bernard Lo joined the newly merged channel whose operations have been based in Singapore ever since. Programmes and personalities came mostly from ABN and were for the most part retained in their original form (i.e., title and graphics scheme). CNBC Asia also mainly used ABN's own graphics scheme rather than adopt those in use by CNBC US and CNBC Europe. In addition, there was no regional ticker for most audiences until 26 October 1998 and simulcasts of US and European programmes were very limited.", "* Geoff Cutmore (now with CNBC Europe, hosting Squawk Box Europe)"]}, {"page": "Squawk Box", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | CNBC Europe || Squawk Box Europe || 20px (1996\u2014present) || Geoff Cutmore, Steve Sedgwick and Karen Tso", "| Squawk Outside The Box || 20px (2007) || Geoff Cutmore"]}, {"page": "Squawk Box Europe", "response": ["Squawk Box Europe (since May 2011, billed on-screen as just Squawk Box) is a television business news programme on CNBC Europe, aired from 7-10am CET (6-9am WET) each weekday.
