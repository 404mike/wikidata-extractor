In mid-December, Doran announced he wanted to stay at the club and that he hoped Butcher would offer him a new contract.

At the end of the season, the speculation finally ended when Doran signed a new three-year contract with the club.", "The 2014\u201315 season started well for Doran, as the club earned 13 points in the first six matches.
