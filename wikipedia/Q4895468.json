Part of the Belmore family of British actors through her marriage to actor Herbert Belmore, she began her career as a child actress in British pantomimes and music hall variety acts. As a young adult she was one of the Belmore Sisters in variety entertainment before beginning a more serious acting career performing in classic plays by William Shakespeare with Ben Greet's Pastoral Players in a 1911 tour of the United States. She made her Broadway debut as Portia in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1912. She returned to Broadway numerous times in mainly comedic character roles over the next 40 years, notably creating parts in the original Broadway productions of  Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers's By Jupiter (1942) and Anita Loos's Gigi (1951). She worked in several productions mounted by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., including appearing in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1925 with W.C. Fields and Will Rogers, and starring as Parthy Ann Hawks in the 1929 Australian tour and 1932 Broadway revival of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat.\nIn more serious work, Belmore portrayed the nurse in the United States premiere of Jean Anouilh's Antigone (1946), and starred as Ftatateeta in the 1949 revival of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. In the latter part of her career she made numerous appearances on American television from 1948 to 1953. Also active as an actress in Great Britain, she worked frequently as a character actress in British cinema from 1933 to 1940 in addition to appearing on the British stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ziegfeld Follies", "response": ["*Bertha Belmore"]}, {"page": "Show Boat", "response": ["|Ethel Owen, Bertha Belmore, Marjorie Gateson, Margaret Hamilton, Dorothy Loudon, Cloris Leachman, Karen Morrow, Elaine Stritch"]}, {"page": "Belmore", "response": ["* Bertha Belmore (1882\u20131953), British stage and film actress"]}, {"page": "Please Teacher (film)", "response": ["*Agatha Pink - \tBertha Belmore"]}, {"page": "Antigone (Anouilh play)", "response": ["Actress Katharine Cornell produced and starred in a 1946 production at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.Google Books: Antigone at the National Theatre, 1946  Sir Cedric Hardwicke played the role of King Creon.
