His seemingly fragile appearance earned him many epithets, including the \"Merthyr Matchstick\" and the \"Bionic Bantam\". He began boxing at the age of eight and undertook a long amateur career, competing in more than 120 fights and representing Wales in competitions. He turned professional in September 1976 at the age of 20, winning his debut bout against George Sutton. Owen beat Sutton again in his sixth professional fight to win his first title, the vacant bantamweight title in the Welsh Area.\nOwen challenged for the British bantamweight title in his tenth professional fight in 1977. He defeated champion Paddy Maguire in the eleventh round to win the title, becoming the first Welshman in more than 60 years to hold the belt. Owen recorded five further victories, including a defence of his British title against Wayne Evans, before meeting Paul Ferreri for the Commonwealth bantamweight title. He defeated the experienced Australian on points to claim the Commonwealth title and challenged Juan Francisco Rodr\u00edguez for the European title four months later. The fight in Almer\u00eda, Spain, was shrouded in controversy and Owen suffered his first defeat in a highly contentious decision.\nOwen went on to win seven consecutive bouts within a year to rechallenge Rodr\u00edguez in February 1980. He avenged his earlier defeat by beating Rodr\u00edguez on points to win the European title. He challenged World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Lupe Pintor for his world bantamweight title on 19 September 1980, losing the contest by way of a twelfth round knockout after being knocked down for the third time. Owen left the ring on a stretcher and never regained consciousness. He fell into a coma and died seven weeks later in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 24.\nOwen possessed a professional career record of 25 wins (11 by knockout), 1 draw and 2 defeats. His only career losses came against Rodr\u00edguez and Pintor. He remains revered in the South Wales Valleys where he was raised, particularly in his hometown of Merthyr Tydfil where a statue commemorating his life and career was unveiled in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1980", "response": ["** Johnny Owen, Welsh professional boxer (b. 1956)"]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["** Johnny Owen, Welsh boxer (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Johnny Owen (1956\u20131980)"]}, {"page": "The Carnival of Champions", "response": ["Before the event, there was no palpable animosity, at least between Gomez and Pintor, and they were friendly towards each other during a press conference a few days before the fights; this might have been due in part to Gomez's 1981 defeat at the hands of Salvador Sanchez, Sanchez's tragic death on August 12, 1982 in a car accident, Pintor's fight with Johnny Owen after which Owen died as a consequence of the blows he took and Duk Koo Kim's recent death after a bout with Ray Mancini.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/02/sports/pintor-and-gomez-know-the-hazards.html"]}, {"page": "Lupe Pintor", "response": ["His next bout ended tragically.
