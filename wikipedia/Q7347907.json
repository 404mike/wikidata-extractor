He served as Recorder of Denbigh from 1795 to 1796, then entered politics under the patronage of the Whig Duke of Norfolk. He became a member of Brooks's on 26 April 1796, and was an unsuccessful candidate for Leominster before being elected to the House of Commons for Herefordshire the same year, replacing Sir George Cornewall. In Parliament he acted with the Foxite Whigs.\nBiddulph succeeded his father in 1800, and also succeeded his uncle Francis Biddulph as partner in the bank Cocks, Biddulph & Co. On 24 December 1801 he married Charlotte, daughter of Richard Myddelton and sister of Richard Myddelton, of Chirk Castle. He adopted the additional name of Myddelton on 29 December 1801 after his wife had inherited Chirk Castle in 1796 from her unmarried brother. They had two sons and one daughter.\nIn the 1802 general election Myddelton Biddulph was defeated by Cornewall and left Parliament, but resumed the office of Recorder of Denbigh (which he held until his death) and became a common councilman of the borough. In 1803 he was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the Chirk Volunteers. His wife's family had long represented Denbigh in Parliament, and in 1806 he succeeded her brother-in-law Frederick West as Member for Denbigh Boroughs.\nIn his second time in Parliament Myddelton Biddulph sat as an independent, in opposition to the government. He fell out with his wife's brother-in-law West in 1811 and was not re-elected in 1812.\nHis children were Robert Myddelton Biddulph MP and General Sir Thomas Myddelton Biddulph", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denbigh Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Robert Myddelton Biddulph"]}, {"page": "Robert Biddulph", "response": ["*Robert Myddelton Biddulph (1761\u20131814), MP for Herefordshire and Denbigh Boroughs", "*Robert Myddelton Biddulph (1805\u20131872), MP for Denbighshire and Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire; son of the above"]}, {"page": "Robert Myddelton Biddulph (1805\u20131872)", "response": ["Robert Myddelton Biddulph (20 June 1805 \u2013 21 March 1872) was a British landowner and Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party.", "He was the elder son of Robert Myddelton Biddulph (1761\u20131814) of Burghill by his wife Charlotte Myddelton of Chirk Castle, Denbighshire.
