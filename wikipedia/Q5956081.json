Similarly, The Sweeney (1975\u201378) alludes to the phrase \"Sweeney Todd\" for \"Flying Squad\", a rapid response unit of London's Metropolitan Police. In The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (1976\u201379), a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously attempted to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids'='kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). It was also featured in an episode of The Good Life in the first season (1975) where Tom and Barbara purchase a wood-burning range from a junk trader called Sam, who litters his language with phony slang in hopes of getting higher payment. He comes up with a fake story as to the origin of Cockney Rhyming slang and is caught out rather quickly. In The Jeffersons season 2 (1976) episode \"The Breakup: Part 2\", Mr. Bentley explains Cockney rhyming slang to George Jefferson, in that \"whistle and flute\" means \"suit\", \"apples and pears\" means \"stairs\", \"plates of meat\" means \"feet\"."]}, {"page": "February 4", "response": ["*1905 \u2013 Hylda Baker, English comedian, actress and music hall performer (died 1986)"]}, {"page": "May 1", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 Hylda Baker, English comedian, actress and music hall performer (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "1905", "response": ["** Hylda Baker, English actress (d. 1986)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Hylda Baker (1905\u20131986)"]}, {"page": "Bloomsbury", "response": ["*Hylda Baker, the actress and TV comedienne, had an apartment in Ridgmount Gardens in Torrington Place, Bloomsbury, where she lived throughout the 1960s and 70s when she was in London.Notable London Abodes: Hylda Baker"]}, {"page": "Blackpool", "response": ["* Hylda Baker (1905\u20131986) \u2013 comedian"]}, {"page": "Top of the Pops", "response": ["Occasionally bands played live, examples in the 1970s and 1980s being the Four Seasons, the Who, Blondie, John Otway, Sham 69, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Jimmy James and the Vagabonds, The Sweet, The Jackson 5, Heavy Metal Kids, Elton John, Typically Tropical, New Order, Whitney Houston and David Bowie.
