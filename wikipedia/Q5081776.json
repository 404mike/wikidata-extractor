Meher Baba calls this state the Eternal Beyond-Beyond State of God (or Paratpar Paramatma), which has no experience of Self, nor of any of its Infinite latent attributes. Latent in this Infinite state is the undifferentiated and unmanifested Everything. Meher Baba says that the state of the man's consciousness during sound sleep is literally the same original divine sound sleep state of God. Synopsizing this concept in God Speaks biographer Charles Purdom writes, \"In the beginningless beginning, in the beyond the beyond, God Is in absolute sound sleep.\"Purdom, Charles, The God-Man: The Life, Journeys & Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence & Spiritual Teaching, George Allen & Unwin, London, 1964. p. 322", "To make this first event more approachable to understanding, Baba gives the metaphor of an Infinite ocean and a drop of that ocean.Charles Haynes, Ph.D. Meher Baba, The Awakener, Avatar Foundation, Inc., 1993, p. 7 In this metaphor, Paramatma (a vedantic term, for which Meher Baba says Over-soul would be the closest western equivalent) is likened to an infinite and limitless ocean. Any drop of this ocean (the drop signifying the individuated soul) is the ocean itself, since no differentiation between drops has yet been conceived. If we liken the manifestation of the First Urge as the imagined separation of one drop from the ocean, then the infinite ocean comes to look upon itself through this drop as merely this most finite, most limited drop of the infinite and unlimited ocean. It is important to keep in mind that here Meher Baba is using metaphor and analogy to explain changes in God's imagination and the development of consciousness and that he is not describing a metaphysical ocean or literal drops in any sense. As Charles Purdom writes, \"The 'ocean\u2019 is a symbol, no more.\"Purdom, Charles, The God-Man: The Life, Journeys & Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence & Spiritual Teaching, George Allen & Unwin, London, 1964. p. 310", "English author and Meher Baba biographer Charles Purdom was given a copy of the manuscript of God Speaks to edit, but wrote to Baba that it would take him two to three years to edit and prepare the book for publication in England.Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, by Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 4600"]}, {"page": "Upasni Maharaj", "response": ["Upasni moved to Sakori in July 1917 and Meher Baba frequently stayed there as late as October 1922.

Charles Purdom recounts that, at the end of December, 1921, Upasni made several comments relating to Meher Baba. He said to his disciples: \"I have given my charge to Meherwanji. He is the holder of my key.\" Some time later he said \"This boy will move the world. Humanity at large will be benefited at his hands.\" A few days later he sent for Gustadji Hansotia, one of his leading disciples, and told him \"I have made Meherwanji perfect. He is the Sadguru of this Age. Now you have to leave me and stick to him.\" To Behramji he said, \"Your friend is God-realized; carry out every command and every desire of his.\" Finally, one night he folded his hands and said, \"Meherwanji, you are adi-shakti: you are Avatar.\"Purdom, op. cit., p. 26."]}, {"page": "Perfect Master (Meher Baba)", "response": ["Perfect Master is the English term Meher Baba began to use in his writing as early as 1925Infinite Intelligence, Meher Baba, Sheriar Press, 2005 to denote the Eastern idea of a sadguru (Vedanta) or a qutub (Sufism). A Perfect Master, according to Baba, is a God-realized person (one whose limited individualized consciousness has merged with God) who can use his Divine attributes of Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss for the spiritual upliftment of others.Meher Baba, The Awakener, Charles Haynes, Ph.D., The Avatar Foundation, Inc., 1989, p. 21 In describing Meher Baba's specialized use of the term Charles Purdom writes, \"The title \u2018Perfect Master\u2019 . . . means one who has himself reached the goal to which he directs others: one who, pointing to God, has himself realized God.\"The God-Man: The Life, Journeys & Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence & Spiritual Teaching, C.

Enthusiastic about the positions, in his spare time he qualified as a town planner and as an architect.
