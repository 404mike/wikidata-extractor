He was a close friend of Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley. In November 1711 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was later its vice-president.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 1", "response": ["*1749 \u2013 William Jones, Welsh mathematician and academic (b. 1675)"]}, {"page": "Leonhard Euler", "response": ["Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to write f(x) to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter  for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter \u03a3 for summations and the letter  to denote the imaginary unit. The use of the Greek letter \u03c0 to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones."]}, {"page": "Newton's method", "response": ["The name \"Newton's method\" is derived from Isaac Newton's description of a special case of the method in De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas (written in 1669, published in 1711 by William Jones) and in De metodis fluxionum et serierum infinitarum (written in 1671, translated and published as Method of Fluxions in 1736 by John Colson). However, his method differs substantially from the modern method given above. Newton applied the method only to polynomials, starting with an initial root estimate and extracting a sequence of error corrections. He used each correction to rewrite the polynomial in terms of the remaining error, and then solved for a new correction by neglecting higher-degree terms. He did not explicitly connect the method with derivatives or present a general formula. Newton applied this method to both numerical and algebraic problems, producing Taylor series in the latter case."]}, {"page": "Pi", "response": ["The number  (; spelled out as \"pi\") is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 3.14159. It is defined in Euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and also has various equivalent definitions. The number appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics. The earliest known use of the Greek letter \u03c0 to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706. It is also referred to as Archimedes's constant.", "The earliest known use of the Greek letter  alone to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work ; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics. The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase \"1/2 Periphery ()\" in the discussion of a circle with radius one.See : William Oughtred used the letter  to represent the periphery (that is, the circumference) of a circle. However, he writes that his equations for  are from the \"ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin\", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767."]}, {"page": "William Jones (philologist)", "response": ["Sir William Jones  (28 September 1746 \u2013 27 April 1794) was an Anglo-Welsh philologist, a puisne judge on the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, and a scholar of ancient India, particularly known for his proposition of the existence of a relationship among European and Indo-Aryan languages, which he coined as Indo-European.", "William Jones was born in London; his father William Jones (1675\u20131749) was a mathematician from Anglesey in Wales, noted for introducing the use of the symbol \u03c0. The young William Jones was a linguistic prodigy, who in addition to his native languages English and Welsh, learned Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew and the basics of Chinese writing at an early age. By the end of his life he knew eight languages with critical thoroughness, was fluent in a further eight, with a dictionary at hand, and had a fair competence in another twelve.", "Sir William Jones sometimes also went by the nom de plume Youns Uksfardi (\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0633 \u0627\u0648\u06a9\u0633\u0641\u0631\u062f\u06cc, \"Jones of Oxford\").

Godfrey (1967) \"Sir William Jones and P\u00e8re Coeurdoux: A philological footnote,\" Journal of the American Oriental Society, 87 (1) :  57-59. In 1786 Jones postulated a proto-language uniting Sanskrit, Iranian, Greek, Latin, Germanic and Celtic, but in many ways his work was less accurate than his predecessors', as he erroneously included Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese in the Indo-European languages, while omitting Hindustani and Slavic. Jones also erroneously suggested  that  Sanskrit  \u2018was  introduced  [to  north  India]  by  conquerors from other kingdoms in some very remote age\u2019 displacing \u2018the pure Hindi\u2019 of north India.", "In Europe a discussion as to the authenticity of the first translation of the Avesta scriptures arose. It was the first evidence of an Indo-European language as old as Sanskrit to be translated into a modern European language. It was suggested that the so-called Zend-Avesta was not the genuine work of the prophet Zoroaster, but was a recent forgery. Foremost among the detractors, it is to be regretted, was the distinguished (though young) orientalist William Jones. He claimed, in a letter published in French (1771), that the translator Anquetil-Duperron had been duped, that the Parsis of Surat had palmed off upon him a conglomeration of worthless fabrications and absurdities. In England, Jones was supported by Richardson and Sir John Chardin; in Germany, by Meiners. Anquetil-Duperron was labelled an impostor who had invented his own script to support his claim. This debate was not settled for almost a century.", "Maurice, Thomas.

Containing a retrospective survey of the progress of science and the Mohammedan Conquests in Asia.", "Arthur Schopenhauer referred to one of Sir William Jones's publications in \u00a71 of  The World as Will and Representation (1819). Schopenhauer was trying to support the doctrine that \"everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.\" He quoted Jones's original English:", "... how early this basic truth was recognized by the sages of India, since it appears as the fundamental tenet of the Ved\u00e2nta philosophy ascribed to Vyasa, is proved by Sir William Jones in the last of his essays: \"On the Philosophy of the Asiatics\" (Asiatic Researches, vol. IV, p. 164): \"The fundamental tenet of the Ved\u00e2nta school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which would be lunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and in contending that it has no essence independent of mental perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible terms.\"", "Schopenhauer used Jones's authority to relate the basic principle of his philosophy to what was, according to Jones, the most important underlying proposition of Ved\u00e2nta. He made more passing reference to Sir William Jones's writings elsewhere in his works.", "On 28 September 1822 the Dutch orientalist Hendrik Arent Hamaker, who accepted a professorship at the University of Leiden, gave his inaugural lecture in Latin De vita et meritis Guilielmi Jonesii (The Life and Works of William Jones)(Leiden, 1823).", "Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"Berenice\" starts with a motto, the first half of a poem, by Ibn Zaiat: Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.
