He won seven Scottish international caps and represented his country in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, playing in the 2\u20130 win against Zaire.Blackley began a managerial career with Hamilton in October 1981, while continuing his playing career. He left Hamilton in 1983 and became a player/coach at Hibs, his first senior club, and was then promoted to the manager's position at Easter Road in 1984. His final managerial role was at Cowdenbeath, which he left to become Gordon Wallace's assistant at Dundee.\nBlackley has since worked at several clubs with Paul Sturrock, including St Johnstone, Dundee United, Plymouth Argyle twice, Sheffield Wednesday and Swindon Town. His brief has been to work specifically with the defenders, passing on the experience he accrued in his 17-year playing career. Blackley was part of a successful coaching trio alongside Paul Sturrock and Kevin Summerfield that saw them achieve four promotions in six seasons. Blackley and Summerfield left Plymouth in October 2009 after being advised their contracts, which were due to expire at the end of the 2009\u201310 season, were not going to be renewed.In 2011, Blackley was assistant manager of Stirling Albion, working alongside Jocky Scott.

Swindon pounced at the opportunity to acquire the services of Sturrock and on 7 November 2006 Sturrock was confirmed as manager with Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley following him from Wednesday. Sturrock's first season in charge at Swindon was a success, achieving promotion from League Two to League One.", "On 27 November 2007, Sturrock resigned his post as Swindon Town manager after just over a year with the club to rejoin previous club Plymouth Argyle. Sturrock also brought back to the club assistants Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley, who were previously with him during his first successful spell as manager. Sturrock then proceeded to take the club to its highest league position in 20 years: tenth in the Championship. However, the team subsequently struggled and finished five points and one place outside the Championship relegation zone in the 2008\u201309 season. On 10 December 2009, Sturrock was removed as Plymouth Argyle manager and put into a business support role by chairman Sir Roy Gardner. On 22 April 2010 the Plymouth board confirmed that Paul Sturrock had left his role within the club to pursue other managerial opportunities. Following Sturrock's departure, it emerged that the board had mis-managed the finances of the club and Argyle entered administration."]}, {"page": "Cowdenbeath F.C.", "response": ["* John Blackley (1987\u20131988)"]}, {"page": "Stirling Albion F.C.", "response": ["A poor start to season 2010\u201311 saw John O'Neill and assistant Roddy Grant under pressure.
