After making his debut at the age of sixteen, he spent a brief spell on loan with Greenock Morton before establishing himself in the first team.

Scoring over 30 times in the First  Division following promotion, he joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion for \u00a33.5 million in August 2004.\nHe played for several English clubs before later in his career playing in Israel, Canada, and the United States.
