At half time Swift slumped in the dressing room, blaming himself and his decision not to wear gloves for the goal.

Some claimed that Brook's lob was a cross, but those who knew Brook said it was the type of unconventional thing he would try. The FA Cup winning City team included goalkeeper Frank Swift and left half Jackie Bray, who would both emulate Brook by going on to appear for England. Swift fainted from nervous exhaustion just before the City team were about to ascend the steps at Wembley to collect the trophy and their winners medals.
