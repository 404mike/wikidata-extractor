He is best known for being the founder and first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, and for being the first British Governor of the Falkland Islands. He has been described by 20th-century British diplomat David Tatham, as an 'Empire builder'.\nMoody founded British Columbia as the Colony of British Columbia, having been hand picked to \"found a second England on the shores of the Pacific\". The Colonial Office under Lord Lytton desired to send to the nascent Colony 'representatives of the best of British culture' who possessed 'courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world' and decided to send Moody, whom the British government considered to be the archetype of the 'English gentleman and British Officer', as Commander of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia, and the first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.\nMoody is considered to be the founding father of British Columbia. He selected the site for and founded the new capital of British Columbia, New Westminster, and has been described as 'the real father of New Westminster'. In British Columbia, he also established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park, and named Burnaby Lake after his private secretary Robert Burnaby and Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \"Mary Hill\" after his wife, Mary. He also designed the first Coat of arms of British Columbia. Port Moody in British Columbia, and Moody Park and Moody Square in New Westminster, are named after him.\nHe was also the first British Governor of the Falkland Islands, whose settlements he planned and built whose and infrastructure he established. He selected the site for and founded Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, and Moody Brook in the Falkland Islands is named after him. Moody Point in Antarctica is also named after him.\nDuring the Crimean War, Moody was Commanding Executive Officer of Malta.\nA member of the prominent British Moody family, which made an important contribution to the administration and expansion of the British Empire during the 19th century, Richard Clement was the eldest son of Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight of the Order of Military Merit; the brother of Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB, Commander of the Royal Engineers in China and agent of the Hudson's Bay Company in Canada; and the father of Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody CB.\nLike his brother Hampden Clement, Richard Clement was a polymath who displayed prodigious abilities in mathematics, music, and architectural draughtsmanship from an early age, and who enjoyed both science and the fine arts. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a Gentleman Cadet at the age of 14, became Head of School the following year, and left school having completed his examinations one year later.\nHe planned the restoration of Edinburgh Castle on the basis of musical chords, for which he was summoned to Windsor Castle to present his plans to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, both of whom were delighted. He has been described as 'a visionary in a plain land' and 'a man who could conceive of Edinburgh Castle in terms of a musical score'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Westminster", "response": ["New Westminster (colloquially known as New West) is a city in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, and a member municipality of the Metro Vancouver Regional District.
