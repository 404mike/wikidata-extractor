The movement was partially inspired by Cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the Vorticist manifesto in Blast magazine. Familiar forms of representational art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a hard-edged abstraction. Lewis proved unable to harness the talents of his disparate group of avant-garde artists; however, for a brief period Vorticism proved to be an exciting intervention and an artistic riposte to Marinetti's Futurism and the post-impressionism of Roger Fry's Omega Workshops.For a full account of Vorticism see the introductory essay by Richard Cork in the exhibition catalogue Vorticism and Its Allies (London: Arts Council of Great Britain, 1974), pp. 5\u201326. A recent and concise definition is available at the Tate's website: https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/v/vorticism.", "BLAST was launched at a 'riotous celebratory dinner'Cork, Vorticism and Its Allies, p. 21. at the Dieudonn\u00e9 Hotel in the St James's area of London on 15  July 1914.The Dieudonn\u00e9 (the 'God-Given') was a French-run hotel at 9\u201311 Ryder Street (now part of Christie's building in King Street). It closed later in 1914. In William Roberts's large painting from 1961\u20132 The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915, Roberts represents the BLAST launch as being at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel in Percy Street, Fitzrovia.  Richard Cork clarifies that the painting is an 'imaginative evocation' of the event 'rather than a historically accurate record ... . [however] the Tour Eiffel's genial proprietor, Rudolphe Stulik, was always lavish with his hospitality towards the Vorticists; and Roberts ... . testified that \"in my memory la cuisine Fran\u00e7aise and Vorticism are indissolubly linked\u201d' \u2013 Cork, Vorticism and Its Allies, pp. 106\u20137. The magazine was mainly the work of Lewis, but also included extensive written pieces by Ford Madox Hueffer and Rebecca West, as well as poetry by Pound, articles by Gaudier-Brzeska and Wadsworth, and reproductions of paintings by Lewis, Wadsworth, Etchells, Roberts, Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska and Hamilton.BLAST can be viewed online from many sources, including https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1143209523824858.pdf. The manifesto was apparently 'signed' by eleven signatories.Under 'Signatures for Manifesto' on page 43 of BLAST No.1 were listed 'R. Aldington', 'Arbuthnot', 'L. Atkinson', 'Gaudier Brzeska', 'J. Dismorr', 'C. Hamilton', 'E. Pound', 'W. Roberts', 'H. Sanders' (sic), 'E. Wadsworth' and 'Wyndham Lewis'. Lewis, Pound and Gaudier-Brzeska were at the intellectual heart of the project, but Roberts's later comments suggest that most of the group were not made aware of the manifesto's contents before publication.Roberts, Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work, p. 9. Jacob Epstein was presumably too established to be co-opted as a signatory, and David Bomberg had threatened Lewis with legal action if his work was reproduced in BLAST and made his independence very clear through a one-man show at the Chenil Galleries, also in July, where his large abstract painting Mud Bath was prominently displayed outside above the entrance.Cork, Vorticism and Its Allies, p. 24.", "There was almost no opportunity for the rebel artists to work creatively while in active service.See William Roberts, Memories of the War to End War 1914\u201318 (London, 1974) for an account of life on the front line and the commissioning processes for war artists.

When John Quinn died, in 1927, his collection of Vorticist works was auctioned and dissipated to now untraceable purchasers, presumably in America.Greene, 'Ezra Pound and John Quinn', p. 81. Writing in 1974, Richard Cork, noted that 'thirty-eight of the forty-nine works displayed by the full members of the movement at the 1915 Vorticist Exhibition are now missing.'Cork, Vorticism and Its Allies, p. 26.", "Five years later, the exhibition 'Vorticism and Its Allies' curated by Richard Cork at the Hayward Gallery, London,27 March\u20132 June 1974. went further in painstakingly bringing together paintings, drawings, sculpture (including a reconstruction of Epstein's Rock Drill 1913\u201315), Omega Workshop artefacts, photographs, journals, catalogues, letters and cartoons. Cork also included twenty-five 'Vortographs' from 1917 by the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn that had been first displayed at the Camera Club in London in 1918.The exhibition catalogue was subsequently supported by Richard Cork's two-volume history Vorticism and Abstract Art in the First Machine Age (London : Gordon Fraser Gallery, 1976)."]}, {"page": "David Bomberg", "response": ["Thirty years after his death, a major retrospective of Bomberg's work curated by Richard Cork was held at the Tate Gallery, London, in 1988.Cork, Richard \"How I Discovered Bomberg\"  Borough Road Gallery, Retrieved 29 January 2014.", "In A Palestine Affair, a 2003 novel by Jonathan Wilson, the character \"Mike Bloomberg\" is loosely based on Bomberg's life, as acknowledged by the author: \"Richard Cork's 'David Bomberg'  [was] ... of inestimable value to me in constructing this fiction\".", "* Richard Cork, David Bomberg.
