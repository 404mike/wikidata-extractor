Following Trevor's death, Little Mo proceeds to marry his sworn enemy Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) \u2013 who had grown to care and bond with Little Mo during her ordeal.

She and brother-in-law Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) become much closer following their respective separations but they end things when Mo learns Alfie is dating Kat behind her back. Alfie and Kat reconcile and leave the Square. Around February 2006, Little Mo is seen struggling to cope with Freddie's constant crying but refuses to medicate him for his teething, so she has trouble getting him to sleep. Freddie gets a head injury in a fight with Bobby Beale (Kevin Curran) so a health visitor visits the Slaters. Little Mo is extremely hostile, seeing this as a questioning of her parenting ability. She constantly takes Freddie to see general practitioner Oliver Cousins (Tom Ellis), who moves her to another GP's patient list because he is interested in her romantically. They start dating in April 2006. Following her divorce, Little Mo and Oliver plan a night away in Brighton, but after a car crash caused by Deano Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) and Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley), she gets cold feet, telling Oliver that she cannot leave Freddie. On her return, she finds him unconscious. Freddie is rushed to hospital, where doctors find another head injury; Social Services suspect Little Mo. Thinking back, Little Mo realises Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) is responsible. She confronts him and shakes him violently when he denies hurting him. Little Mo tries telling people that Ben caused Freddie's injury but no one believes her, not even her own father. Charlie soon realises his mistake and begs her forgiveness for doubting her. After extensive tests, the doctors discover Freddie has a low platelet count due to an infection, meaning that any minor injury can cause serious complications as his blood does not clot properly. Little Mo is cleared by the authorities but local residents think she is responsible. Knowing she will always be suspected, she decides to leave. Feeling guilty, Ben finally told his father Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that he had hit Freddie as Freddie pulled at his hearing aid. Little Mo is not sure what to do but decides not to tell the authorities. Phil threatens Mo but she tells him she is quite capable of deciding for herself. Oliver suggests she report Ben but she refuses, leading to a nasty scene in the pub when Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) calls Little Mo a child beater.
