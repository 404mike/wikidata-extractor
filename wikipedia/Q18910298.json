Early influences on Phoebe were John Rabson, a socialist councillor and fellow trade unionist, and Edith Morley of Reading University, the first female professor in the country. The Reading branch was a pioneer of the Workers' Educational Association, and Phoebe enrolled on Morley's WEA classes in English Literature. \"Morley was a socialist, a suffragette, and a member of the Fabian Women's Group. Her ideas had a great influence on Phoebe, and the two became life-long friends\" (quoted in Stout 1997 p 12). During the First World War, Phoebe was a pacifist, and left the Anglican Church over the issue. Her pacifism made her unenthusiastic about the idea of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Britain. During the war she began her freelance journalism career, and was a writer all her life (Stout 1997, Chapter 1)."]}, {"page": "Miss Edith Julia Morley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Morley"]}, {"page": "Emma Ritter-Bondy", "response": ["Emma Ritter-Bondy, also known as Emma Ritter (9 January 1838 in Graz - 23 June 1894 in Glasgow) was a Scottish pianist and music professor of Austrian origin.Irina Vaterl: Emma Ritter-Bondy.
