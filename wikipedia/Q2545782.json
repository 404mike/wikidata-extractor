Born at Reading, England, he was educated at Bradfield College, London University and Lausanne University. He entered the Royal Navy Medical Service in 1903 and retired with the rank of staff surgeon in 1912. He was acting medical officer at the British legation in 1913 and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I. From 1920 to 1927 he was a medical officer in the Ministry of Health. In 1930 he made a major career change when he was appointed the first lecturer in Chinese art and archaeology at the School of Oriental Studies at London University. In 1932 he became Professor of Chinese Art and Archaeology at London University and held the post until his retirement in 1946.\nYetts's special fields of study were the Chinese bronzes and jades of the prehistoric period. He wrote numerous articles, while his books included:\n\nChinese Bronzes (1925)\nThe Cull Chinese Bronzes (1939)\nRitual Bronzes of Ancient China (1942)In 1929 he contributed three volumes to the monumental catalogue of the collection of Asian art of George Eumorfopoulos.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Xia Nai", "response": ["Xia left for his studies at University College London in June 1935 and arrived in the United Kingdom in September later that year.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 1, pp.367-402. By the time of his studies, Sir Flinders Petrie had already retired from the university and it was Sir Mortimer Wheeler who was heading the Institute of Archaeology and the archaeology course at University College London. Xia learned Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics under professor Stephen Glanville.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.100-2. While many of his professors were well established and knowledgeable, Xia criticized Walter Perceval Yetts, one of his professors in archeology for his incompetence in both Chinese and archaeology, and challenged his ironic role in heading the department of Chinese Art and Archaeology at London University. He pointed out how Yetts could not read Chinese when a student raised a question during a lecture and how he struggled to comprehend dynastic jargon when analyzing the authenticity of an original record by the Qing imperial court kept in the British Museum.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.120-1. Xia accumulated a handful of field experience in archaeology by participating in Wheeler's excavation at Maiden Castle in Dorset in July 1936 and returned to London in September later that year.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.78-96. He also participated in the British's excavation project in Armant, Egypt and Tell Duweir, Palestine. Xia visited Petrie during his time in Palestine as the latter was recovering in a hospital in Jerusalem. Despite being far away from home, he always kept himself updated on China's ever-changing situation through reading the newspaper and having conversations with fellow Chinese students studying abroad.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.102-3. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, Xia left for home in 1939. However, Xia spent a year conducting Egyptology research at the Cairo Museum for almost a year and only arrived at Kunming, China in 1941."]}, {"page": "Walter Percival Yetts", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walter Perceval Yetts"]}, {"page": "HMS Thistle (1899)", "response": ["The Thistle was subsequently transferred to the China Station, where she was assigned to protect British imperial interests in the treaty ports along the Yangtze river, and was deployed 600 miles inland at Hankou (now part of the Wuhan conurbation). The early years of this assignment were relatively leisurely, and the Thistle's surgeon, Walter Perceval Yetts, acquired a deep admiration for Chinese civilization, which would lead him to become an important sinologist."]}, {"page": "1944 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Professor Walter Perceval Yetts, , Professor of Chinese Art and Archaeology, London University."]}]}}
