She was educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where she gained her doctorate and was later awarded a research fellowship and a post-doctoral research fellowship at Girton College. Rubin studies the social and religious history of Europe between 1100 and 1500, concentrating on the interactions between public rituals, power, and community life.\nIn 2012 she gave a Turku Agora Lecture. In 2017 she gave the Wiles Lectures at Queen's University Belfast.Her books have been well received in newspapers and academic journals. The Guardian calls her Hollow Crown \"a magnificent history of the late Middle Ages\". The TLS reviews her Cities of Strangers as a \"thoughtful and pioneering book\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peasants' Revolt", "response": ["Rural communities, particularly in the south-east, were unhappy with the operation of serfdom and the use of the local manorial courts to exact traditional fines and levies, not least because the same landowners who ran these courts also often acted as enforcers of the unpopular labour laws or as royal judges. Many of the village elites refused to take up positions in local government and began to frustrate the operation of the courts. Animals seized by the courts began to be retaken by their owners, and legal officials were assaulted. Some started to advocate the creation of independent village communities, respecting traditional laws but separate from the hated legal system centred in London.;  As the historian Miri Rubin describes, for many, \"the problem was not the country's laws, but those charged with applying and safeguarding them\".", "The name \"the Peasants' Revolt\" emerged in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and its first recorded use by historians was in John Richard Green's Short History of the English People in 1874. Contemporary chronicles did not give the revolt a specific title, and the term \"peasant\" did not appear in the English language until the 15th century. The title has been critiqued by modern historians such as Miri Rubin and Paul Strohm, both on the grounds that many in the movements were not peasants, and that the events more closely resemble a prolonged protest or rising, rather than a revolt or rebellion.; ; ", "* The Peasants' Revolt, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Miri Rubin, Caroline Barron & Alastair Dunn (In Our Time, 16 November 2006)"]}, {"page": "English Heritage", "response": ["* \"Heritage\", BBC Radio 4 discussion with David Cannadine, Miri Rubin & Peter Mandler (In Our Time, 18 July 2002)"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Miri Rubin (born 1956), social, Europe 1100\u20131600"]}, {"page": "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "response": ["*Academics: Emanuel Adler, Michael Albeck, Yoram Ben-Porat, Ahron Bregman, Richard I.
