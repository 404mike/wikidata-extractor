He was born in Cambridge, and was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, obtaining his BA in 1886 (as 5th wrangler), MA in 1890, and DSc in 1896. He was a professor at University College of North Wales, and is generally credited with developing the modern mathematical treatment of the motion of airplanes in flight as rigid bodies with six degrees of freedom.\nAside from minor differences in notation, Bryan's 1911 equations are the same as those used today to evaluate modern aircraft. (Perhaps surprisingly, Bryan's equations\u2014published just eight years after the first aircraft flew\u2014are most accurate when applied to supersonic jets.) In evaluating aircraft mathematically, Bryan focused on issues of aerodynamic stability rather than on control; stability and control of an aircraft tend to lie on opposite ends of the same spectrum. Bryan's aeronautic results were an extension of his earlier work in fluid dynamics. In 1888, Bryan developed mathematical models for fluid pressures within a pipe and for external buckling pressures. These models are still used today.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "First law of thermodynamics", "response": ["In 1907, George H. Bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter (closed systems): \"Definition. When energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work, the energy so transferred is called heat.\"Bryan, G. H. (1907), p. 47. Also Bryan had written about this in the Enzyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, volume 3, p. 81. Also in 1906 Jean Baptiste Perrin wrote about it in Bull. de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais de philosophie, volume 6, p. 81. This definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision, as follows. This was systematically expounded in 1909 by Constantin Carath\u00e9odory, whose attention had been drawn to it by Max Born. Largely through Born's influence, this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers. It might be called the \"mechanical approach\".Bailyn, M.

He attended the local Board School and Porthmadog County School before entering the University College of North Wales in 1908. His primary course of study was in mathematics which he was taught by Professor George H. Bryan, F.R.S., an English applied mathematician who was an authority on thermodynamics and aeronautics. Additionally Jones studied Welsh philology taught by Sir J. Morris-Jones. He won prizes including the R.A. Jones prize in mathematics (1910) and was considered an extraordinary student. In 1911 he graduated with a second class honours degree in Pure Mathematics, following this with a first class honours degree in Applied Mathematics in 1912. ", "From 1913 to 1916 he held an 1851 Exhibition Science Research Scholarship studying at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and later at the National Physics Laboratory in Teddington. In this period he published an important paper with George H. Bryan called \"Discontinuous Fluid Motion Past the Bent Plane, with Special Reference to Aeroplane Problems\", which was seen as an important development in the understanding of aerodynamics. After this he joined the staff of the Aerodynamics Division of the National Physical Laboratory, staying there until his retirement in 1953.

A reviewer of the first edition noted that the book contains \"the outlines of a long series of researches for which hitherto it has been necessary to consult English, French, German, and Italian transactions\". Section 5.1 Style One of those first edition reviews, by George H. Bryan in 1905, began a controversy among Cambridge University professors related to the use of Cambridge Tripos problems in textbooks. In 1980, Herbert Goldstein mentioned the book in his famous textbook Classical Mechanics where he noted that it was outdated, but remained a useful reference for some specialised topics. While it is a historic textbook on the subject, presenting what was the state-of-the-art at the time of publication, a 2014 \"biography\" of the book's development pointed out that the book remains influential for more than historical purposes.", "The first edition of the book received several reviews, including George H. Bryan in 1905 and Edwin Bidwell Wilson in 1906, Section 4.1 An American point of view: E. B. Wilson as well as German reviews by Gustav Herglotz, also in 1906 and Emil Lampe in 1918. Section 4.4 Other Reviews Lampe called the treatise an \"excellent work\" and states that Cambridge's treatment of analytical dynamics \"has had, as a consequence, that the English student is directed with great energy towards the study of mechanics in which he displays excellent performance, as can be gauged from the many, and not at all easy, problems appended at the end of each chapter of this book.\"", "The review George H. Bryan published in Nature on 27 April 1905 sparked controversy among Cambridge professors at the time. The review received several notable responses from Whittaker's colleagues, although Whittaker himself never publicly spoke of it. Section 4.3 The \"Fictitious Problem\" polemic The main actors in the polemic, other than Whittaker and Bryan, are an anonymous professor referred to only as \"An Old Average College Don\", Alfred Barnard Basset, Edward Routh, and Charles Baron Clarke. The controversy revolved around Bryan's claim that many of the problems included in the book are \"fictitious\", similar to those used in the Cambridge Tripos examinations. Of particular contention was Bryan's statement that a \"perfectly rough body placed on a perfectly smooth surface forms as interesting a subject for speculation as the well-known irresistible body meeting the impenetrable obstacle\" and that \"[w]hat the average college don forgets is that roughness or smoothness are matters which concern two surfaces, not one body\". The controversy stretched from 18 May to 22 June with letters on the dispute published in five issues of Nature. A reviewer later wrote that \"100 years after they were written, it is difficult not to view the whole polemic as prompted by a bout of hair-splitting on the part of Bryan\", though it was acknowledged that Bryan's original claim was \"undoubtedly correct\" and the \"polemic\" was likely a misunderstanding.", "The second and third editions received several reviews, including another one from George H. Bryan as well as Philip Jourdain, George David Birkhoff, and Thomas MacFarland Cherry. Jourdain published two similar reviews of the second edition in different journals, both in 1917. The more detailed of the two, published in The Mathematical Gazette, summarises the book's topics before making several criticisms of specific parts of the book, including the \"neglect of work published from 1904 to 1908\" on research over Hamilton's principle and the principle of least action. After listing several other problems, Jourdain ends the review by stating that \"all these criticisms do not touch the very great value of the book which has been and will be the chief path by which students in English speaking countries have been and will be introduced to modern work on the general and special problems of dynamics.\" Bryan also reviewed the second edition of the book in 1918 in which he criticises the book for not including the dynamics of aeroplanes, a lapse Bryan believes was acceptable for the first but not for the second edition of the book. After discussing more about aeroplanes and the development of their dynamics, Bryan closes the review by stating that the book \"will be found of much use by such students of a future generation as are able to find time to extend their study of particle and rigid dynamics outside the requirements of aerial navigation\" and that it would serve as \"a valuable source of information for those who are in search of new material of a theoretical character which they can take over and apply to any particular class of investigation.\" George David Birkhoff wrote a review in 1920 stating that the book is \"invaluable as a condensed and suggestive presentation of the formal side of analytical dynamics\". Birkhoff also includes several criticisms of the book, including stating it was incomplete in some respects, pointing to the methods used in chapter sixteen on trigonometric series."]}]}}
