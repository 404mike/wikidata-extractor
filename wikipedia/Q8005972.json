He was the town's Member of Parliament (MP) for all but four of the years between 1918 and 1945.\nBromfield came to prominence in the local trade union movement in the early 1900s.  William Stubbs had been the leader of almost all the many small unions of silk workers in the town, but he was ageing, and by 1907, Bromfield had taken over from him as secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Winders, Fillers and Braid Makers, the Amalgamated Society of Silk Spinners and Throwsters, the Amalgamated Society of Female Silk Operatives, and the Leek Amalgamated Society of Silk and Cotton Dyers.  He also succeeded James Cockersole as secretary of the Associated Trimming Weavers' Society.In 1907, all the unions led by Bromfield, with the Amalgamated Society of Silk Pickers, still led by Stubbs, affiliated to the new Leek Textile Federation.  In an election to become general secretary of the federation, Bromfield defeated Stubbs.  In 1919, the unions merged to form the Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades (ASTWKT), whose membership covered Staffordshire and South Cheshire, and Bromfield was elected as its secretary, serving until 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leek, Staffordshire", "response": ["* William Bromfield (1868\u20131950) trade unionist and Labour Party politician,Hansard 1803\u20132005 \u2192 People (B), Mr William Bromfield retrieved 6 March 2018 MP for Leek 1918 / 1931 and 1935 / 1945"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "Staffordshire Moorlands (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["In the first, longer part of this period the seat was held mainly by William Bromfield (Lab), secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades (ASTWKT), whose membership covered Staffordshire and South Cheshire, and then by the future Lord Davies of Leek, who as the main aide to the Prime Minister, was tasked with secret talks with Ho Chi Minh which failed due to a leak."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*William Bromfield, Leek, 1918\u201331; 1935\u201345"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "Leek (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Bromfield", "| William Bromfield"]}, {"page": "Harold Davies, Baron Davies of Leek", "response": ["Davies was elected in 1945 for his large north Staffordshire seat that included a northern part of the Newcastle-under-Lyme-Stoke-on-Trent conurbation, partly employed in the increasingly uncompetitive basic clothes textiles manufacturing (see William Bromfield) but also, in the towns themselves, as today, also having major employment in the high quality, niche firms comprising the Staffordshire Potteries.
