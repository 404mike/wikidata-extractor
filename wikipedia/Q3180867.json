He is a faculty member of Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, France. Bondy is known for the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal theorem together with V\u00e1clav Chv\u00e1tal. His coauthors include Paul Erd\u0151s.\nBondy received his Ph.D. in graph theory from University of Oxford in 1969. Bondy has served as a managing editor and co-editor-in-chief of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B.Bondy was dismissed from his tenured position at Waterloo in 1995, after 28 years in which he had been a major contributor to the renown of the University's Department of Combinatorics and Optimization. The reasons for dismissal centered on \"Bondy's acceptance of a teaching post in France, and the acceptability of someone who is on UW's faculty payroll holding a full-time job elsewhere.\"Paul Erd\u0151s, at the time the world's most renowned combinatorialist, returned his honorary doctorate to the University of Waterloo in protest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bondy's theorem", "response": ["In mathematics, Bondy's theorem is a bound on the number of elements needed to distinguish the sets in a family of sets from each other.

In the first ever combinatorial mathematics conference in China held in Dalian in July 1983, when two Canadian mathematicians Eric Mendelsohn and John Adrian Bondy, who were the referees of Lu's papers, arrived and asked for Lu Jiaxi, one of the organizers thought they were looking for the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the same sounding name. It was the first time the Chinese combinatorialists got to know him. Upon hearing Lu present his work in a session, Wu Lisheng of Soochow University recommended that he should give a talk on it at the closing ceremony. After his talk, he received a unanimous accolade. In August, he took part in a combinatorics workshop in Hefei as a helper and gave a talk there."]}]}}
