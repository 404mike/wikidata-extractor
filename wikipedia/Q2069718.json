Clement played as a right fullback who developed his career with Queens Park Rangers through the club's youth set-up. Clement signed professional terms in 1965 and made his first team debut in the 1966-67 season. This season was a particularly memorable one for QPR, as they won the Football League Third Division championship by a substantial margin of twelve points and also became the first ever Third Division club to win a major national trophy \u2013 the League Cup, defeating the First Division club West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132 at Wembley Stadium.\nThe following season, Clement became an established starting member of the team, making 34 appearances in another successful season for QPR as they gained promotion to the First Division. He missed only six games in the four seasons between 1970 and 1974, and made a total of 472 first team appearances for QPR during his fourteen year career at the club.\nClement was selected to represent England in March 1976, making his international debut against Wales. He won five full England caps in total, including two games against Italy.In June 1979 Clement was transferred to Bolton Wanderers for a fee of \u00a3170,000. After playing 33 league games for them he then returned to London, signing in October 1980 for Fulham, where he made 18 league appearances.Clement then joined Wimbledon in late August 1981. He played 9 matches for the club, scoring 2 goals, but sustained a broken right leg during a match at Lincoln City in October 1981. Doctors feared that the injury was serious enough to end his career, although in an interview in early 1982, Clement stated that he hoped to continue playing for a few more years. On 31 March 1982, he committed suicide at his father-in-law's flat in Battersea, having suffered from depression for several years. He killed himself by poisoning himself with weed killer and he also stabbed himself with a kitchen knife. The official verdict at the coroner's inquest into Clement's death stated that a combination of his worries about his football career and the fact that he thought he was suffering from cancer caused him to take his own life.A special memorial match for Clement was arranged by QPR in order to raise funds for his family, and was held at Loftus Road in the week prior to QPR's first ever FA Cup Final appearance in May 1982.\nHis youngest son Neil, who was only three years old at the time of his father's death, later became a professional footballer himself and spent the majority of his career playing for West Bromwich Albion. His eldest son Paul became a noted football coach who worked with Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, and was formerly manager at Swansea City, Reading and Derby  County.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["The club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the 1979\u201380 season, which eventually resulted in Bobby Campbell's sacking in October 1980, to be replaced by Malcolm Macdonald.

It is still the only major trophy that QPR have won. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at Wembley Stadium. After winning promotion in 1968 to the top flight for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in Division Two.

Only the winner would progress to the finals. Just before the campaign began England suffered a 2\u20131 defeat to Scotland to finish second in the 1975\u201376 British Home Championship. England made heavy work of both Finland and Luxembourg, winning 4\u20131 away and 2\u20131 at home against the Finns and 5\u20130 at home and 2\u20130 away against the Luxembourgers. The failure to inflict heavier defeats on these sides was ultimately the reason why Italy qualified for the finals on goal difference alone. England fell to a 2\u20130 defeat in Rome where Revie was criticised for his previously untested back four selection of Emlyn Hughes, Dave Clement, Roy McFarland, and Mick Mills; he also played Trevor Brooking out of position and surprised many by selecting Stan Bowles ahead of Stuart Pearson. Sensing that he was disliked by FA chairman Sir Harold Thompson, and with further criticism coming his way after England could only finish third in the 1976\u201377 British Home Championship, Revie began to look for a way out. He missed a friendly with Brazil in Rio de Janeiro for what he claimed was a scouting assignment on the Italians, when in fact he had travelled to Dubai for contract negotiations with the United Arab Emirates. Revie asked for his contract with England to be cancelled, which the FA refused to do and the FA offered Revie their full support despite having already approached Bobby Robson to replace him. The game with Brazil ended in a 0\u20130 draw, and their tour of South America concluded with draws with Argentina and Uruguay. On 12 July 1977, Revie revealed in an exclusive to the Daily Mail that he was quitting the England job to become manager of the UAE. The FA suspended Revie from football for ten years on a charge of bringing the game into disrepute; Revie contested his suspension in a lawsuit against the FA, and the court overturned the suspension after ruling that the FA had overreached its powers."]}, {"page": "Wimbledon F.C.", "response": ["Still in south London, 1980\u201381 saw Wimbledon regain Third Division status at the first attempt, at the end of an eventful season which saw chairman Ron Noades walk out of the club to take over Crystal Palace, taking manager Dario Gradi to Selhurst Park with him. At Plough Lane, assistant manager Dave Bassett was promoted to manager. Under Bassett, Wimbledon were relegated in 22nd place. Just before the survival battle was lost, injured defender Dave Clement committed suicide. Wimbledon once again regained Third Division status at the first time of asking, triumphing as Fourth Division champions in 1982\u201383, and in the next season the Wimbledon players continued to excel as they achieved a second promotion to the Second Division after finishing runners-up with 97 league goals."]}, {"page": "American Indian Film Festival", "response": ["| Amos Adetuyi, Dave Clement, Michelle Derosier and Floyd Kane"]}, {"page": "Frank McLintock", "response": ["McLintock was signed by Queens Park Rangers in June 1973 for a fee of \u00a325,000; he chose to join QPR ahead of West Bromwich Albion as he wanted to remain in the First Division.
