He gained an international reputation both as a professional sports cyclist and a manufacturer of bicycles.\n\nAlso known as \u2018Happy Jack\u2019, John Keen trained as a carpenter but his passion was the new sport of cycling on high bicycles (penny-farthing) which were newly developed from the velocipede. It has been reported that he began racing as early as 1869 and when a racing track opened in Surbiton he won the first event.\nHe raced over a number of distances. In 1872 he was recorded as having ridden ten miles in less than 36 minutes and in 1874 he rode 50 miles in 3 hours and nine minutes. In May 1873 Keen, with James Moore introduced larger wheeled bicycles to France at the championships in Lyon where wheel sizes up to 45 inches had been the norm.Keen frequently competed against Fred Cooper for the One Mile Professional Championship. An athletic newspaper at the time reported that 12,000 people attended a meeting at Wolverhampton to see the men compete.In the spring of 1876 John Keen travelled to New York with his bicycle. By 1878 he was internationally reputed to be the fastest rider in the world, the professional champion of England  and his name appeared on advertisements (in 1879) for the Columbia bicycle manufactured in the USA which stated his achievement of 1 mile in 2 minutes and 43 seconds (22 mph).\nIn 1879 Keen, together with David Stanton and William Cann were invited to race in the United States against inexperienced local opposition. In pursuit of all records from one to twenty miles, Keen achieved 16 miles and 790 yards in one hour. It was said that he sailed to New York to take on John S.Prince in 1883.\nIn the 1870s Keen set up a business developing and manufacturing bicycles in Surbiton. Kingston Museum has an example of a bicycle bearing a badge \"John Keen Surbiton Hill 1872\". A printed notice held in the papers of the Cyclists' Touring Club reassures the public that he is still making his Eclipse bicycles to which there are significant improvements this year (September 1877). C.F. Caunter wrote that \"John Keen, at Surbiton, built machines lighter and higher than had previously been thought possible.\" He appears to have moved his business to Dalston Junction, then Clapham and latterly returning to Surbiton (Victoria Road). His cycles were known by the brand name \u2018Eclipse\u2019. Bartleet\u2019s Bicycle Book (1931/32) describes a juvenile bicycle fitted with pedals \" which are Keen's patent hanging pedals with a single ball bearing: these were the invention of \"Jack\" Keen, the famous professional rider, his patent No. 14867/1887.\"His business moved to a workshop in Thames Ditton beside The Angel public house which was popular with cyclists using the Portsmouth Road. It is recorded in the census of 1901 that he lived at Claremont Terrace, Portsmouth Road, Long Ditton.\nHe died in Finchley on 13 January 1902, of tuberculosis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surbiton", "response": ["* John Keen \u2013 racing cyclist"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* John Keen"]}, {"page": "County Ground, Taunton", "response": ["In the winter of 1880, Somerset County Cricket Club, prompted by an article in the Somerset County Gazette describing cricket in Taunton as being \"in a sorry plight\",Roebuck (1991), p24. were considering building their own ground.  Athletics was  booming in the town, and it was an amalgamation of sporting clubs that leased seven and a half acres of land known as \"Rack Field\" from local gentleman farmer John Winter for \u00a350 per year.  A cricket pitch, cycling-track and running-track were all laid on the ground with great difficulty; with the land lying next to the River Tone.  Although Edward Western promised that Somerset could play fixtures on the ground, he acknowledged that the cricket pitch belonged to Taunton Cricket Club.  The new sports centre was opened on Whit Monday 1881, with an athletics fixture held on the newly laid running-track to mark the occasion.  Although some cricket was played at the ground in 1881, it was not yet ready for first-class matches.  Taunton Athletic Society, thanks to money raised by Western, funded the erection of a grandstand and pavilion on the ground ready for a 15-mile bicycle race between French champion Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric De Civry and John Keen in August 1881.Roebuck (1991), pp24\u201325."]}, {"page": "John Keen", "response": ["John Keen may refer to:", "*John Keen (cyclist) (1849\u20131902), British professional cyclist and manufacturer of bicycles", "*John Keen (Kenya politician), member of Kenya African National Union", "*John Keen (Canadian politician), speaker of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (1918\u20131920)", "*John Keene (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Keen (surname)", "response": ["* John Keen (cyclist) (1849\u20131902), British cyclist"]}, {"page": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Civry", "response": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Civry was born in Paris on 21 August 1861. He received his education in England, and spent much of his cycling career in that country. He was generally considered to be an amateur cyclist in France, and frequently competed in that category, but Hugh Dauncey, in French Cycling: A Social and Cultural History, suggested that he was financially dependent upon the sport, and was considered a professional by the English press. He competed in the 1881 Grand Prix of Angers, finishing as the overall champion, and the sprint champion. In the same year, he became the French National Sprint Champion and was second overall at the Blois road race.  In late 1881, he competed twice against the English champion, John Keen. In the first race at The Crystal Palace, de Civry was given a one-minute head start, and won when Keen retired halfway through. The second was a scratch 20-mile race at the same venue. Keen again retired, after 11 miles, and De Civry completed the race in 1 hour 4:21, beating the professional record by just over five seconds."]}, {"page": "Fred Cooper (bicyclist)", "response": ["It is not known what led Cooper to take up professional cycling but his first recorded appearance in this capacity was in a velocipede race at Chesterfield in June 1870.Sheffield Independent, 9, 11 June 1870  From that date on he made frequent appearances on the racing circuit until his retirement from professional cycling in 1879.  He was essentially a sprinter rather than a long-distance rider.  His favoured distance was one mile and he made frequent bids for the title of all-England one-mile champion.  His first attempt was in November 1870 at the Molineux Stadium in Wolverhampton where he won his initial heat but appears to have been defeated in the final.Birmingham Daily Post 30 November 1870, p.5  However, between 1872 and 1879 he secured the title on at least six occasions.  His great rival for this accolade was John Keen: the title alternated between the two over a number of years and they are said to have competed against each other for the title on 17 or 18 occasions The sources vary: the race at Lillie Bridge on 23 September 1879 was described by the Illustrated London News, 27 September 1879, as the 18th championship encounter between Cooper and Keen whilst the Sunday Times, 28 September 1879, states that it was the 17th. with Cooper winning eight times and Keen nine.  But whilst Keen and Cooper were professional rivals, they seem to have been on friendly terms: in later life they lived in the same village in Surrey, Long Ditton, Cooper took part in a benefit race for Keen in 1885 and was actively involved in 1900 as member of a committee formed to raise funds to support Keen who was said to have fallen on hard times.The Times, 28 September 1885, p. 10; Pall Mall Gazette, 4 January 1900, p. 9", "During the 1890s Cooper showed a particular interest in the aquacycle or hydrocycle, a kind of scull powered by a bicycle mechanism rather than by oars.  The concept had been known for at least 20 yearsEdward H. Knight, Knight's American Mechanical Dictionary ...   (New York : Hurd and Houghton, 1877), vol. 3, p. 2698 but little interest had been shown in it.  Cooper's interest probably dated from when, some time between 1881 and 1891, he moved to a house close to the river Thames in Long Ditton in Surrey.  It may also be connected with the fact that his old rival John Keen had patented a similar machine in about 1885.Daily News, 29 January 1885, p. 6  The earliest reference that has been found to Cooper's machine is dated 1890.Bartleet (1931), plate 43  It required three cyclists to power it and it could attain a speed of 8 m.p.h., although it was said to be hard work even at 6 or 7 m.p.h.  In May 1893 Cooper and his team completed the 101 miles from Oxford to Putney in 19 hours 27 minutes.Cycling, 16 April 1892, 20 May 1892, 6 May 1893, p. 276  He continued to use his hydrocycle on a regular basis throughout the 1890s and probably later, although his interest was probably simply as a personal hobby or diversion: he seems to have made no attempt to market the hydrocycle on a commercial basis.", "By 1891 Cooper had moved to Long Ditton where he lived at 8 Cholmley Villas, close to the south bank of the river Thames.  Perhaps no more than a coincidence, his old rival, John Keen, also lived in Long Ditton.Morning Post, 3 November 1892, p. 2  He remained a widower but his household included a housekeeper and her three daughters.  In 1900 Cooper married the oldest of these daughters (Ellen Amelia Turner) who was 16 years his junior.  Probably at about the same time he moved to a house in Albany Park Road, Ham near Kingston upon Thames and again close to the banks of the Thames.  He had no further children and remained at that address until his death on 21 July 1935 which took place at Hove.  His estate was sworn at \u00a38,358; the principal beneficiary was his one daughter."]}]}}
