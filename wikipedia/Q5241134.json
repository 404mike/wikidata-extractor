In 1863 he met Sir Thomas Lloyd at a Congregationalist meeting at Hawen Chapel, Rhydlewis, at a time when Lloyd was regarded as the future candidate for the Cardiganshire county seat. However, he was disappointed that Lloyd declined to oppose the sitting member, Colonel Powell of Nanteos, who in 1865 briefly reversed a decision to retire due to ill-health before withdrawing again a short time later. At the 1865 General Election, Kilsby was a prominent supporter of David Davies in his unsuccessful campaign in Cardiganshire, and he had close links with Aberystwyth radicals such as John Matthews and John Jones (Ivon). His polemical account of the Cardiganshire election in the Traethodydd was long regarded as a definitive account. In 1865 Kilsby Jones also actively campaigned for David Williams in Merioneth."]}, {"page": "David Williams (Merioneth)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Williams (Liberal politician)"]}, {"page": "Leonard Williams (physician)", "response": ["Williams was born in Castell Deudraeth, Merionethshire.
