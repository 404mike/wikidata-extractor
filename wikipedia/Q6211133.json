Stevenage opened the scoring midway through the first-half, Byron Harrison, starting only his second game for the club, heading in Lawrie Wilson's deep cross. Gillingham equalised in first-half injury time, Cody McDonald scoring from close range. The visitors took the lead just after the interval, Adebayo Akinfenwa, who also scored for Gillingham in the reverse fixture, scored from six yards out following good work by Joe Martin. Stevenage manager Graham Westley made two second-half changes, bringing on Ben May and Peter Winn, the latter supplying the cross for Harrison to score his second with fifteen minutes remaining to restore parity. Another 2\u20132 draw followed three days later, this time against Accrington Stanley. Stevenage had a two-goal lead courtesy of strikes from Byron Harrison and Lawrie Wilson, but two late Accrington goals meant that the points were shared. Three days after the draw with Accrington, Stevenage travelled to Gigg Lane for their first ever game against Bury. The game ended 3\u20130 to Bury, courtesy of goals from Andy Bishop, ex-Stevenage defender Efe Sodje, and Ryan Lowe. Stevenage fell to their fifth consecutive away defeat just four days later, losing 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a first-half Nicky Wroe strike. The club made it five league games without victory on 15 February, drawing 0\u20130 at home to Oxford United. Four days after the stalemate with Oxford, Stevenage secured their first away win in four months, winning 1\u20130 at Crewe Alexandra courtesy of an 87th-minute goal from Byron Harrison \u2013 Stevenage's first away goal in the league since 2 November 2010. This was followed up with another away win three days later, this time securing three points against Port Vale at Vale Park, winning the match 3\u20131. Stevenage took the lead fifteen minutes before the interval when Anthony Griffith's 30-yard backpass took a bobble and rolled over Port Vale goalkeeper Chris Martin's foot. The visitors doubled their lead seven minutes later when Peter Winn scored a low drilled effort. Port Vale got a goal back through Sam Morsy, but David Bridges restored Stevenage's two-goal lead after Byron Harrison's cross had ricocheted off the goalkeeper and fell to the feet of Bridges. Stevenage's last game of February was a home game against Cheltenham Town, with Stevenage securing their third consecutive league victory, winning the game 4\u20130. Goals from Mark Roberts and Byron Harrison had given Stevenage a two-goal lead going into half-time. Michael Bostwick added a third in the 52nd minute, lashing the ball across goal from just inside the area after a tidy interchange with Byron Harrison. Two minutes later, Harrison then added his second of the game, and Stevenage's fourth, when he headed in Lawrie Wilson's right wing cross."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Joe Martin", "| Joe Martin"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["Postponements through the winter saw a fixture packed March in which Argyle played seven games.

Argyle pushed the 10 men of Gillingham for the next hour but failed to score, losing 1\u20130. Three days later, Argyle had better fortunes on the road, beating AFC Wimbledon 2\u20131 with goals from Onismor Bhasera, just 12 seconds into the game, and Nick Chadwick either side of a Jack Midson goal for the Dons. A visit to the Don Valley Stadium was next, where a penalty given away by Darren Purse saw Lewis Grabban score to earn Rotherham United all three points. The next week, the pendulum swung once again, with Paul Wotton scoring his first goal since returning to Argyle in a 1\u20130 win over Shrewsbury Town, lifting the Greens out of the bottom two once again. Next up was the visit of Bristol Rovers, who took a first half lead through Matt Harrold, only for Maxime Blanchard to equalise late on for the hosts, which saw Argyle rise to 21st position in the table. Argyle completed the loan signing of Steve Fletcher from AFC Bournemouth, who sat out Argyle's 0\u20130 draw away to Northampton Town, before making his debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win at home to Bradford City, where Juvhel Tsoumou's goal saw Argyle claim the three points, to sit on forty points for the season."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|=||MF||||12||Joe Martin||1||0||0||0||1", "|12||||MF||Joe Martin||7||3||0||0||1||0||0||0||8||3"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|3||DF||Joe Martin||2||0||0||0||2", "|3||DF||Joe Martin||6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0"]}]}}
