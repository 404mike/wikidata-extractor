His parents named him Stanley Frederick in honour of Stanley Matthews and Freddie Steele.He was prolific in his first spell at Port Vale between 1955 and 1961, and hit 66 goals in 185 league games, helping the \"Valiants\" to the Fourth Division title in 1958\u201359. He was sold to West Bromwich Albion in March 1961 for \u00a310,000, but returned to Port Vale for the same fee four months later. He proved to be less prolific in his second spell at the club, and was given a free transfer in April 1965. He spent time in South Africa with Port Elizabeth City before a brief and unsuccessful third spell at Port Vale in January 1968.

It's a team game, not an individual sport\". In December he signed a new two-year contract to keep him tied to the club until summer 2021. On 12 January, he picked up a hamstring injury during a 3\u20130 home loss to Colchester United and was ruled out of action for 'a few weeks'. On 30 March, he scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Northampton Town, and in doing so became only the third player (after Wilf Kirkham and Martin Foyle) to score 100 goals for the club.

His \u00a310,000 offer for Aston Villa's Gerry Hitchens was rejected, whilst interest in re-signing Ronnie Allen also went nowhere. Low instead got 'bustling' Ted Calland on a free transfer from Exeter City, and sold Fred Donaldson to Exeter for \u00a32,000. In November he signed Bert Llewellyn from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a37,000. His team put in some memorable performances, including a 5\u20130 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, in what Roy Sproson later described as his 'greatest memory' and 'one of their finest hours'; the performance was so impressive they received 'a standing ovation' from the home crowd, as the \"Valiants\" finished the game 'rolling the ball about like a game of chess'. Vale were in the promotion hunt until late in the season, as Low released Albert Leake and sold Stan Steele to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a310,000. Vale recorded a seventh-place finish, and Low ended the campaign by releasing Harry Oscroft (Brantham Athletic), Ted Calland (Lincoln City), John Poole (Macclesfield Town), and Peter Hall (Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic).", "He added to his squad for the 1961\u201362 campaign by spending \u00a32,000 on inside-forward Arthur Longbottom (Queens Park Rangers); \u00a310,000 on Stan Steele (back from West Brom); and \u00a32,000 on centre-half John Nicholson (Liverpool); whilst free signings included winger Stan Edwards (Everton), goalkeeper Peter Taylor (Middlesbrough), and Joe Maloney (Shrewsbury Town). He sold Cliff Portwood to Grimsby Town for \u00a36,000 to balance the books. The Sentinel commented that \"gloom has descended\" following a poor start to the season, however the Vale's form improved after Low sold Dennis Fidler to Grimsby Town for \u00a32,000, signed Colin Grainger from Leeds United for \u00a36,000, and further added to his firepower by signing Ralph Hunt from Swindon Town for \u00a33,500. Stanley Matthews' return to the Victoria Ground resulted in Low unsuccessfully trying to tempt Tom Finney out of retirement.

Low made many changes of personal, making the team barely recognisable to that of the glory days just a few years earlier. New man Stan Steele rifled in a total of 22 goals, but it was not enough to prevent a 15th-place finish, and therefore a ticket to the new fourth tier. Their first season in this new division was extremely successful, as the club took the title with a club record 110 goals. Normal Low picked out three star players: 'the supreme goalscorer' Graham Barnett, 'the find of the season' Ken Hancock and that 'model of consistency' Stan Steele. With five forwards hitting double figures, a profit being made and the gate receipts increasing, optimism was high in Burslem, especially with the Bycars End terrace work being completed leading to an overall capacity of 50,000.", "On 9 January 1960, Port Vale gave 'one of the finest performances in their history', beating high flying Second Division outfit Cardiff City 2\u20130 at Ninian Park, and 'thoroughly deserved' their Third Round victory. In round four, 'the defence took the honours' in a 1\u20130 win at second tier Scunthorpe United. The fifth round held eventual Second Division champions Aston Villa, who ran out 2\u20131 winners at Vale Park. Their fine cup form did not transfer over to the league however, and a mid-table position finished the 1959\u201360 season. Stan Steele was an ever-present for the third season running. The club meant business in 1960\u201361, as proven by a \u00a310,000 attempt to sign Villa's Gerry Hitchens. In January, Albert Leake left for Macclesfield Town, leaving Roy Sproson the only surviving member of the legendary 1953\u201354 outfit. After Stan Steele was 'rested' following 195 consecutive appearances and consequently put in a transfer request. In March 1961 he moved to West Brom for a \u00a310,000 fee. Cliff Portwood's 26 goals helped the club achieve a seventh-place finish.", "The club's poor start to 1962\u201363 left a heckled Stan Steele transfer listed. On 30 October Low shocked the fans with his resignation, even more surprisingly old boss Freddie Steele was reinstated. The \"Steele curtain\" returned to Vale Park, as the team went 525 minutes without conceding a goal, ironically this run was ended by Ronnie Allen, now with Crystal Palace scored an otherwise meaningless consolation goal. The previous season's top scorers Bert Llewellyn and Arthur Longbottom were sold to Northampton Town for \u00a37,000 and Millwall for \u00a32,000 respectively. On 13 March the club went out of the FA Cup at the fourth round, defeated 2\u20131 by top tier Sheffield United. Tony Richards was bought for \u00a39,000 in March and amazingly became the season's top scorer with 13 goals in three months and 14 games. With rivals Stoke promoted from the second tier and Crewe from the fourth, Vale finished in third, four points off the Second Division.", "The club flopped completely in 1964\u201365. Goalkeeper Ken Hancock was sold to Ipswich Town at Christmas time, raising \u00a310,000. Freddie Steele departed in February, as Jackie Mudie was appointed caretaker manager. Mudie created 'a punchier attack and a far more stable defence' as the club managed four home wins in a row. However the club were relegated in 22nd place, five points away from safety. No club in the Football League had scored less than Vale's tally of 41, with top scorer Cheesebrough managing just seven strikes. To slash the wage bill, Stan Steele, Ron Smith, Ron Andrew, Tim Rawlings and Stan Trafford all left on free transfers.
