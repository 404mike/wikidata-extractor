", "*  Darcy Graham"]}, {"page": "Gregor Townsend", "response": ["Townsend's second Six Nations campaign started well with a convincing win over Italy by 33-20, with a hat-trick from Blair Kinghorn alongside tries to Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris. Scotland dominated the game until a surprising fight-back by Italy in the last 10 minutes saw the Azzurri score three times to set up a tense finish. A close-fought but chaotic loss to Ireland by 13-22 came the following week, with further losses to France (10-27) and eventual Grand Slam winners Wales (11-18) in the ensuing rounds. In the last game of the competition, Scotland faced England at home in Twickenham. The first half was almost entirely one-sided, with England racing out to a 31-0 lead in the first 30 minutes, until Stuart McInally scored a breakaway try off a charge-down from English captain Owen Farrell. The second half witnessed a stunning comeback by the Scots, with a flurry of tries to Darcy Graham, Magnus Bradbury, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson putting Scotland into the lead by 38-31 with 4 minutes to go before a last-gasp try to replacement English fly-half George Ford, who then converted to level the final score at 38-38. The drawn result allowed Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup, and was both the highest-scoring draw and the highest-scoring comeback of any rugby match on record."]}, {"page": "Hawick RFC", "response": ["* Darcy Graham"]}, {"page": "Scotland national rugby sevens team", "response": ["* Darcy Graham *", "* Darcy Graham "]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|1098||GrahamDarcy Graham||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|(Wing)||2018-11-03|| v Wales at Principality Stadium"]}, {"page": "Russia at the Rugby World Cup", "response": ["|LW ||11||Darcy Graham || || "]}, {"page": "Scotland national under-20 rugby union team", "response": ["*Darcy Graham (Hawick)", "*Darcy Graham (Hawick)", "*Darcy Graham (Hawick)", "*Darcy Graham (Hawick)"]}]}}
