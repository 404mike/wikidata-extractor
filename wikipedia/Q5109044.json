Since then many authors have taken up the work of translating and editing them. Often these works are filtered through the perceptions and unconscious bias of the translator., It is believed  that the naming of Hrotsvitha plays after men and not women may have been done by Celtis and not Hrotsvitha as her works largely center women and their experiences, making these titles appear inconsistent with what is presented in her work. It has been suggested that Celtis may have misrepresented her work due to his own implicit biases. While the translator Christabel Marshall appears to impose her own understandings of what a 10th-century canoness would be like or would have thought by making her seem timid in her translations. Katharina Wilson does a similar thing in Hrothvitha's work by translating her to seem more humble than she actually is. This has led some to posit that Colleen Butler is the person who best represented Hrotsvitha's work, as she discerned the true comedic nature of her work, by being able to deduce the unwritten context in the writing. However, while there may be some small misrepresentations of Hrothvitha's work, her message, and the known facts about her life remain relatively consistent."]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: M", "response": ["| Christabel Marshall"]}, {"page": "Martin Shaw (composer)", "response": ["He proposed to Edith Craig, Craig's sister, in 1903 and was accepted.
