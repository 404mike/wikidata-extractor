Mary Jones (16 December 1784 \u2013 28 December 1864) was a Welsh girl who, at the age of fifteen, walked twenty-six miles barefoot across the countryside to buy a copy of the Welsh Bible from Thomas Charles because she did not have one. Thomas Charles then used her story in proposing to the Religious Tract Society that it set up a new organisation to supply Wales with Bibles.\nTogether with the Welsh hymnwriter Ann Griffiths (1776\u20131805), Mary Jones had become a national icon by the end of the nineteenth century, and was a significant figure in Welsh nonconformism.", "link_mentions": {}}}
