He served under both Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. As a member of the Ross Sea party in Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Joyce earned an Albert Medal for his actions in bringing the stricken party to safety, after a traumatic journey on the Great Ice Barrier. He was awarded the Polar Medal with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being his contemporary, Frank Wild.\nJoyce came from a humble seafaring background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as an Able Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce to take charge of dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.\nThroughout his career Joyce was known as an abrasive personality who attracted adverse as well as positive comments. His effectiveness in the field was widely acknowledged by many of his colleagues, but other aspects of his character were less appreciated \u2013 his capacity for bearing grudges, his boastfulness and his distortions of the truth. Joyce's diaries, and the book he wrote based on them, have been condemned as self-serving and the work of a fabulist. He made no significant material gains from his expeditions, living out his post-Antarctic life in humble circumstances before dying in 1940.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Polar Medal", "response": ["Several people have been awarded clasps to the medal for earning the award again for polar expeditions.

Wild had just returned from Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition. To captain Endurance Shackleton had wanted John King Davis, who had commanded Aurora during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \"foredoomed\", so the appointment went to Frank Worsley, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0364\u2013365. Tom Crean, who had been awarded the Albert Medal for saving the life of Lieutenant Edward Evans on the Terra Nova Expedition, took leave from the Royal Navy to sign on as Endurances second officer; another experienced Antarctic hand, Alfred Cheetham, became third officer.Fisher 1957, p.\u00a0310. Two Nimrod veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh, who commanded it, and Ernest Joyce. Shackleton had hoped that Aurora would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men, but was turned down.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0370\u2013371. After pressing his case, Shackleton was given one officer from the Royal Marines, Captain Thomas Orde-Lees, who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0372."]}, {"page": "Royal Hospital School", "response": ["* Ernest Joyce, AM (1875\u20131940) \u2013 Antarctic Explorer, hero of the Ross Sea Party of Shackleton's ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition."]}, {"page": "Discovery Expedition", "response": ["Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson\u2013Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894\u201397, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.", "The Discovery Expedition launched the Antarctic careers of several who became stalwarts or leaders of expeditions in the following fifteen years. Apart from Scott and Shackleton, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce from the lower deck returned repeatedly to the ice, apparently unable to settle back into normal life. William Lashly and Edgar Evans, Scott's companions on the 1903 western journey, aligned themselves with their leader's future plans and became his regular sledging partners. Tom Crean followed both Scott and Shackleton on later expeditions. Lieutenant \"Teddy\" Evans, first officer on the relief ship Morning, began plans to lead an expedition of his own, before teaming up with Scott in 1910."]}, {"page": "Nimrod Expedition", "response": ["Shackleton hoped to recruit a strong contingent from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Adrian Wilson the post of chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as-yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two petty officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in."]}, {"page": "Frank Wild", "response": ["John Robert Francis Wild  (18 April 1873\u00a0\u2013 19 August 1939), known as Frank Wild, was an English sailor and explorer.

Produced entirely by members of the expedition, the book was edited by Shackleton, illustrated with lithographs and etchings by George Marston, printed by Ernest Joyce and Frank Wild, and bound by Bernard Day. The production of Aurora Australis was one of the cultural activities Shackleton encouraged while the expedition team over-wintered at Cape Royds on Ross Island in the McMurdo Sound, to ensure that \"the spectre known as 'polar ennui' never made its appearance\"."]}, {"page": "Ross Sea party", "response": ["Another Nimrod veteran, Ernest Joyce, whose Antarctic experiences had begun with Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition, was appointed to take charge of sledging and dogs. Joyce was described by Shackleton's biographer, Roland Huntford, as \"a strange mixture of fraud, flamboyance and ability\",Huntford, p. 194. but his depot-laying work during the Nimrod Expedition had impressed Shackleton.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 21\u201322. On Nimrod, Joyce led the team that laid vital supplies for Shackleton's returning southern party, and Shackleton said \"Joyce knows his work well\".McOrist, p. 12. Ernest Wild, a Royal Naval petty officer, was added to the party possibly through the persuasion of his brother, Frank Wild, who was travelling as Shackleton's second-in-command on Endurance.Huntford, p. 414.", "Believing that Shackleton might attempt a crossing during the first season, Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay, one at 79\u00b0S near Minna Bluff, a prominent Barrier landmark, and another further south at the 80\u00b0 mark. These were, in his view, the minimum that would enable Shackleton's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier.Bickel, pp. 46\u201347. The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for acclimatisation for the dogs and for the untrained men, and this led to differences of view about how to proceed. Ernest Joyce, by far the most experienced Antarctic traveller in the party, favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week.Fisher, p. 400. Joyce claimed that Shackleton had given him independent control over sledging activities,Bickel, p. 38.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 67\u201368. a view rejected by Mackintosh and later demonstrated as without foundation.Tyler-Lewis, p. 260."]}, {"page": "Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition", "response": ["The Times had reported that Shackleton planned to take a dozen men to the Arctic, \"chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier expeditions\".

Some of the Endurance hands had not been fully paid from the earlier expedition, but were prepared to join Shackleton again out of personal loyalty. Another Shackleton loyalist, Ernest Joyce, had fallen out with Shackleton over the money he claimed was owed to him, and was not invited to join the expedition.Tyler-Lewis, pp.\u00a0256\u2013257."]}, {"page": "1940 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 May \u2013 Ernest Joyce, Antarctic explorer (born c.1875)"]}, {"page": "Mount Joyce", "response": ["Mount Joyce is a prominent, dome-shaped mountain,  high, standing on the south side of David Glacier,  northwest of Mount Howard in the Prince Albert Mountains of Victoria Land, Antarctica.
