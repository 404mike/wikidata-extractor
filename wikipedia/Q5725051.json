Outings on the South Downs were a regular part of school life, and Sillar led the boys on nature study expeditions. The school had instituted a Cadet Corps, in which Orwell was an active member.

In 1916 Orwell won a scholarship to Wellington College, a school with a military background appropriate for colonial service. Mr Wilkes also believed Orwell could win an Eton scholarship and would benefit from Eton College life and so he sat the Eton exam as well. Orwell headed the school prize list in 1916 with Classics, while Cyril Connolly won the English prize, Cecil Beaton won the drawing prize, Walter Christie won the history prize and Rupert Lonsdale won the scripture prize. Henry Longhurst, Lord Pollington and Lord Malden were among the winners of other class prizes.Eastbourne Society: Newsletter 131.St Cyprian's Chronicle 1916. Other activities in which Orwell was involved included narrowly missing winning the diving competition, playing the part of Mr Jingle in the school play, and being commended as a useful member of the 1st XI cricket team. Although he had won an Eton scholarship, this was subject to a place becoming available. Instead of going to Wellington he stayed at St Cyprian's for an additional term in the hope that a place at Eton would materialise. As this had not happened by the end of term, he went on to Wellington in January. However, after he had been there for nine weeks, an Eton place became available, which Orwell took.", "Of his contemporaries, Cecil Beaton wrote of the piece \"It is hilariously funny, but it is exaggerated\". Connolly, on reviewing Stansky & Abraham's interpretation, wrote \"I was at first enchanted as by anything which recalls one's youth but when I went to verify some references from my old reports and letters I was nearly sick... In the case of St Cyprian's and the Wilkes whom I had so blithely mocked I feel an emotional disturbance... The Wilkeses were true friends and I had caricatured their mannerisms (developed as a kind of ritual square-bashing for dealing with generations of boys) and read mercenary motives into much that was just enthusiasm.\"Cyril Connolly The Evening Colonnade David Bruce and Watson 1973 Walter Christie and Henry Longhurst went further and wrote their own sympathetic accounts of the school in response to Orwell's and voiced their appreciation for the formidable Mrs Wilkes.W.

His first job in journalism was with The Kansas City Star, before he later joined Time as a foreign correspondent. He was assigned to London to report on arts and theatre, and it was during this time that he met his wife, Jane Ingram. His next assignment was to Mexico City, but when this was completed, rather than return to base, he moved, along with his wife and daughter to a mud hut in Valle de Bravo in Mexico, with the aim of writing a novel. The stay did not last long, and an old colleague from Time enticed him to move to London to work as a sports writer for The Sunday Times. He began writing \"Inside Track\", a column in which he wrote sports diaries, writing about subjects which most writers would actively avoid. Upon the retirement of Henry Longhurst, he became golf correspondent for the paper, and worked for a short time in 1989 as sports editor of the Sunday Correspondent.
