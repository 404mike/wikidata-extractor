Usher lives and operates a guitar-manufacturing business in Innerleithen, Scotland. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he has worked with a variety of artists including Mike Heron, John Martyn, Tam White and the locally noted Border Boogie Band.\nWhile playing in a band called Blewitt in 1980, he first met Fish who became their vocalist for a short time. When Fish left Marillion to start a solo career in 1988, he contacted Usher to become his guitarist. Since then he has played on seven Fish studio albums and the accompanying tours.\nUsher suffered a heart attack in December 2007, causing three gigs to be cancelled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fish (singer)", "response": ["Fish\u2019s debut solo album Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors was released in January 1990. Several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former Dire Straits guitarist Hal Lindes, who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album\u2019s songs. Frank Usher, a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times, also contributed. Drums were played by Mark Brzezicki (Big Country) and John Keeble (Spandau Ballet), John Giblin contributed bass and Lu\u00eds Jardim contributed additional percussion. Backing vocals came from Tessa Niles, who had appeared on Clutching at Straws. Fish also composed the theme music for the 1990s BBC TV series Between the Lines."]}, {"page": "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors", "response": ["The album covers a variety of musical styles, including progressive rock (\"Vigil\"), pop rock (\"Big Wedge\"), hard rock (\"View From the Hill\"),  and folk music (\"The Company\"). As he is primarily a lyricist and not a musical composer, Fish collaborated with keyboardist Mickey Simmonds in writing all songs except \"View From the Hill\", which was co-written and recorded with current Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers. Ex-Dire Straits guitarist Hal Lindes contributed additionally to the writing of \"State of Mind\", \"Family Business\" and \"Clich\u00e9\". He also played guitar on most tracks, along with Frank Usher, a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times. Drums were handled by Mark Brzezicki (of Big Country), John Keeble (of Spandau Ballet, \"State of Mind\" only), bass by John Giblin, additional percussion by Lu\u00eds Jardim, backing vocals by Tessa Niles, who had already appeared on Clutching at Straws, Marillion's last album with Fish (1987), and Carol Kenyon. Apart from these, there  are performances on individual songs by The Kick Horns (brass instruments on \"Big Wedge\"), Davy Spillane (pipes and tin whistle on \"Vigil\"), Phil Cunningham (tin whistle, bodhran, accordion on \"The Company\", \"Internal Exile\"), Aly Bain (violin on \"The Company\", \"Internal Exile\") and Gavyn Wright (credited as Gavin Wright, violin on \"The Company\", orchestral arrangement on \"A Gentleman's Excuse Me\", which was recorded with a 23-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios).", "The band with which Fish toured the album in 1989/1990 consisted of Mickey Simmonds (keyboards), Frank Usher & Robin Boult (guitars), Mark Brzezicki (drums) and Steve Brzezicki (bass, Mark's brother).", "*Frank Usher \u2013 guitars (Tracks 1-7,9-12 and 14)"]}, {"page": "Internal Exile (Fish album)", "response": ["#\"Credo\" \u2013 06:40 (Dick, Simmonds, Robin Boult, Frank Usher)", "* Guitars: Robin Boult & Frank Usher"]}, {"page": "Songs from the Mirror", "response": ["The core line-up on this album is the same as on the 1992 tour.

It features a rougher, more guitar-based and slightly industrial sound on a number of tracks and is therefore perceived as a departure by many fans. However, Fish had explored similar ideas as early as on Sunsets on Empire and Raingods with Zippos (1999). Also, a number of tracks have classic Fish hallmarks, significantly enhanced by the presence of his longtime companion Frank Usher on guitars.", "Steve Vantsis, previously strictly the bassist, emerges as the dominant musician on the album. Apart from most of the songwriting, he is also responsible for electric and acoustic guitars and keyboards. The main guitarist is once again Frank Usher, who also co-wrote one song (\"Openwater\"). Keyboards are handled by Foss Paterson, returning into the line-up for the first time since 1997 (except for a brief one-off stint on the 2000 tour of Bosnia). He also co-wrote the only other non-Vantsis song on the album, the piano ballad \"Miles de Besos\". Further guitar credits go to Chris Johnson (of The Evernauts and Mostly Autumn), who is also the second guitarist on the tour. Another Mostly Autumn connection is former Karnataka drummer Gavin Griffiths, who played with them for most of 2007. Dave Haswell, who had already contributed to Fish's previous three studio albums, plays additional percussion.
