He claimed his hundredth first-class wicket in July against Sussex, when he took the wicket of Andrew Hodd.

He was again quiet in List A matches throughout 2011, making eight appearances in that format, and taking 9 wickets. He once again impressed in that seasons Friends Provident t20, which once again saw Hampshire reach finals day for a second consecutive season, with Briggs making sixteen appearances during the competition. As part of a three-pronged spin bowling attack alongside Tahir and Pakistani Shahid Afridi, Briggs took 23 wickets at an average of 14.91, while also recording his maiden five wicket haul in Twenty20 matches, with figures of 5/19 against Durham. His performances in this format once again caught the eye of the England selectors, this time Briggs was called up the main England squad for their season ending two match Twenty20 International series against the West Indies, though he didn't feature in either match.
