J. Martin, in which they showed that the flocculation of a protein was composed of two distinct processes: the precipitation of a protein from solution was preceded by another process called denaturation, in which the protein became much less soluble, lost its enzymatic activity and became more chemically reactive.  In the mid-1920s, Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky proposed that denaturation was a reversible process, a correct hypothesis that was initially lampooned by some scientists as \"unboiling the egg\".  Anson also suggested that denaturation was a two-state (\"all-or-none\") process, in which one fundamental molecular transition resulted in the drastic changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity; he further noted that the free energy changes upon denaturation were much smaller than those typically involved in chemical reactions.  In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized that denaturation was protein unfolding, a purely conformational change that resulted in the exposure of amino acid side chains to the solvent.  According to this (correct) hypothesis, exposure of aliphatic and reactive side chains to solvent rendered the protein less soluble and more reactive, whereas the loss of a specific conformation caused the loss of enzymatic activity.  Although considered plausible, Wu's hypothesis was not immediately accepted, since so little was known of protein structure and enzymology and other factors could account for the changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity.  In the early 1960s, Chris Anfinsen showed that the folding of ribonuclease A was fully reversible with no external cofactors needed, verifying the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\" of protein folding that the folded state represents the global minimum of free energy for the protein."]}, {"page": "Alfred Theodore MacConkey", "response": ["In 1899 he became an assistant bacteriologist serving the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal in Liverpool under Rubert Boyce at University College, Liverpool.

Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky had shown that denaturation was a reversible, two-state process  that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions, including cleavage by enzymes.  In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding, a purely conformational change that resulted in the exposure of amino-acid side chains to the solvent. Preliminary reports were presented before the XIIIth International Congress of Physiology at Boston (19\u201324 August 1929) and in the October 1929 issue of the American Journal of Physiology.  Wu's hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by Mirsky and Linus Pauling.

The Rideal\u2013Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as \"...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution\".  Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used. The Chick\u2013Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions  in which modern disinfectants are used.", "Calculations by Harriette Chick showed that the killing of bacteria by disinfectants followed first order kinetics. So, the bactericidal activity of a particular disinfectant at a given concentration can be expressed as a constant (k) calculated by employing the formula k = N/C\u00b7T where N is the number of surviving cells, C is the concentration of agent applied and T is the time for which the agent is applied, so k is inversely proportional to dose (C\u00b7T is collectively called dose).
