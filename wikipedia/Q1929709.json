Walsh joined fellow youngsters Robbie Booth, Gavin Lynch and Shaun Whalley in being given first-team opportunities under Ian Rush. His Football League debut followed, again as a substitute at Cambridge United a week later, with his first goal arriving in a 2\u20132 draw against Southend United on 5 March 2005.\nDespite his involvement in the first-team squad, Walsh and the majority of his teammates were released at the end of the season. He spent time on trial with Wrexham and briefly returned to Rhyl before joining Bangor City in September 2005.He followed this with a two-year spell with Marfin Laiki League side APOP Kinyras Peyias. In 2011, he returned to Wales, rejoining Bangor City before moving to Aberystwyth Town in January 2012.As a youngster, Walsh captained the North Wales under 18s side.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Rush", "response": ["But after Rush ruled himself out of the running for the vacant Welsh manager's job on 1 November 2004 things never seemed to go as well. Several heavy defeats were inflicted and Rush was criticised for long-ball tactics  his managerial team opted to use. Despite pressure from chairman Stephen Vaughan, Rush refused to resign after a humiliating 5\u20130 loss to neighbours Shrewsbury Town in February 2005. But when Vaughan sacked Rush's assistant Mark Aizlewood in April, after a 1\u20130 defeat at Darlington, without his knowledge, Rush resigned on principle. By the point of his resignation, Chester were virtually safe from relegation. His spell in charge saw youngsters such as Robbie Booth, Michael Walsh and Shaun Whalley all given their Football League debuts, while players including Michael Brown, George Elokobi and Robbie Foy all spent time on loan at the club."]}, {"page": "Michael Walsh", "response": ["Michael Walsh may refer to:", "* Michael Walsh (Kilkenny hurler) (born 1961), former goalkeeper on the Kilkenny senior hurling team", "* Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1977), English football (soccer) player", "* Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1986), English football (soccer) player for Chester City", "* Michael Walsh (Michael Walsh, 1966\u20132016), Irish handball player from Kilkenny", "* Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1977), English football (soccer) player", "* Michael Walsh (Waterford hurler) (born 1983), current captain of the Waterford senior hurling team", "* Michael Walsh (London hurler) (born 1986), Irish hurler", "* Michael Walsh (Young Irelands hurler) (fl. 2015), Irish hurler", "* Michael Walsh (New York politician) (1810\u20131859), U.S. Representative from New York", "* Michael Walsh (Medal of Honor) (1858\u20131913), chief machinist serving in the U.S. Navy and Medal of Honor recipient", "* \"Michael Walsh\", pen name of Michael McLaughlin (born 1940), British far-right activist ", "* Michael Walsh (engineer) (born 1943), American vehicle emissions engineer", "* Michael Walsh (film critic) (born 1945), Canadian film critic and print journalist", "* Michael Walsh (author) (born 1949), American music critic, author and screenwriter", "* Michael Walsh (publisher) (fl. since 1960s), of Old Earth Books", "* Michael Walsh (British Army officer) (1927\u20132015), British Army major-general"]}, {"page": "Michael Walsh (footballer born 1986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1986)"]}]}}
