According to one such account, in 1940, during the Blitz in London, a Canadian officer suggested to Al Tabor, a British bandleader of the 1920s\u20131940s, that he write a party song with actions similar to \"Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree\". The inspiration for the song's title that resulted, \"The Hokey Pokey\", supposedly came from an ice cream vendor whom Tabor had heard as a boy, calling out, \"Hokey pokey penny a lump. Have a lick make you jump\". A well known lyricist/songwriter/music publisher of the time, Jimmy Kennedy, reneged on a financial agreement to promote and publish it, and finally Tabor settled out of court, giving up all rights to the number.", "In 2008, an Anglican cleric, Canon Matthew Damon, Provost of Wakefield Cathedral, West Yorkshire, claimed that the dance movements were a parody of the traditional Catholic Latin Mass. Up until the reforms of Vatican II, the priest performed his movements facing the altar rather than the congregation, who could not hear the words very well, nor understand the Latin, nor clearly see his movements. At one point the priest would say \"Hoc est corpus meum\" meaning \"This is My body\". That theory led Scottish politician Michael Matheson in 2008 to urge police action \"against individuals who use it [the song and dance] to taunt Catholics\". Matheson's claim was deemed ridiculous by fans from both sides of the Old Firm (the rival Glasgow football teams Celtic and Rangers) and calls were made on fans' forums for both sides to join together to sing the song on 27 December 2008 at Ibrox Stadium. Close relatives of Jimmy Kennedy and Al Tabor have publicly stated their recollections of the origin and meaning of the Hokey Cokey, and have denied its connection to the Mass.Letter to the editor, \"Hokey Cokey: no Catholic dig \u2013 Grandson of the writer defends song against claims that it is anti-Catholic, saying it is based on a phrase about ice cream\", The Times (London, UK) Those accounts differ, but they are all contradicted by the fact that the song existed and was published decades before its supposed composition in the 1940s.", "There is a claim of authorship by the British/Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy, responsible for the lyrics to popular songs such as the wartime \"We're Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line\" and the children's song \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\".
