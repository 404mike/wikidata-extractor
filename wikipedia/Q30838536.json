His images of New Zealand during the 1840s provide an important source for information about the years immediately prior to and during the first years of the New Zealand Wars, during which time he lived in Wanganui. \nHis grandson, Sir Tyrone Guthrie, was a notable theatre director. Power was related to the Irish-American acting family, several members of whom shared his name.
