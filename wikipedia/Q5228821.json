Leicester reached the FA Cup final twice under the stewardship of Gillies in 1961 and 1963.

In 1963, Leicester chased the double. The coldest winter for decades meant Leicester were forced to play a backlogged fixture list on ice, then went on a then club-record 18-game unbeaten culminating in the club sitting atop the First Division on 16 April 1963, causing the press to label Leicester as the \"ice kings\". However, injuries (possibly feigned in light of the upcoming FA Cup final) eventually took their toll and Leicester took just one point from their final five games, seeing them fall to fourth position, though this was still the club's best post-war finish up until the 2015\u201316 season, where Leicester won the Premier League.
