He scored 49 goals in 296 league and cup games in a ten-year career in the Football League.\nHe began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, but only made two Premier League appearances before being allowed to join Brighton & Hove Albion in July 1994. He made 199 appearances for the \"Seagulls\", and was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year (Third Division) in 1998\u201399. He moved on to Port Vale in June 1999, but did not establish himself in the first team. He was transferred to Rotherham United in March 2001, and helped the \"Millers\" to win promotion out of the Second Division, before signing with Leyton Orient in July 2001. He joined non-league Grays Athletic in August 2002, before quickly moving on to Canvey Island. He helped the \"Gulls\" to the Isthmian League title in 2003\u201304, following their second-place finish in 2002\u201303, and also played in the 2004 FA Trophy Final. He moved onto Chelmsford City in August 2006, and helped his new side to the Isthmian League title in 2007\u201308. He signed with Welling United in July 2009, but left the club a month later. He joined amateur side Ware in November 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["In a bid to survive another season in the First Division, Horton allowed ten players to leave Vale Park; the most significant departure was Neil Aspin, as the 34-year-old dropped down two divisions as his career wound down. To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: Jeff Minton from former club Brighton, Tommy Widdrington from Grimsby Town, and Steve Rimmer from Manchester City. As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for \u00a3100,000. He further sold highly rated young centre-back Anthony Gardner to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a31 million, and sold Tony Butler to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a3140,000. In their place he signed Micky Cummins, Mark Goodlad, Sagi Burton, and Ville Viljanen; and also took Martin Bullock, Gareth Taylor, and David Healy in on loan. His side finished second-from-bottom were relegated in his first full season as manager. At the end of the campaign Martin Foyle retired, whilst key players Paul Musselwhite and Ian Bogie also departed.", "In preparation for life in the Second Division, Horton signed Dean Delany, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Michael Twiss on free transfers. Horton came under pressure from the board at the start of the 2000\u201301 campaign, as his team went 13 games without a win, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League Canvey Island. Horton described it as \"the greatest embarrassment of my football career\". He responded to this humiliation by placing five players on the transfer list. He signed Steve Brooker for \u00a315,000; brought in Onandi Lowe and Richard Burgess on free transfer, whilst also offloading Jeff Minton to Rotherham United. Vale's form improved, as they avoided defeat to Stoke City in both Potteries derby games. Horton was named Manager of the Month in March, after a good run of results ended fears of a second successive relegation. He also won his first trophy as a manager as Vale lifted the Football League Trophy, coming from behind to beat Brentford at the Millennium Stadium. Vale upset supporters by selling Dave Brammer to Crewe Alexandra for \u00a3500,000."]}, {"page": "Adam Miller (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["In August 2002, after two final games for Canvey, he moved to Grays Athletic in a swap deal which saw Jeff Minton go in the opposite direction. Although he played 26 times for Grays in the 2002\u201303 season, scoring six goals, he was made available for transfer at the end of the season. He joined Gravesend & Northfleet in September 2003, but played just four games for the club before moving on to Aldershot Town a month later. His form at Aldershot won him The Non-League Paper's Young Player of the Year award for the 2003\u201304 season, and also led to a call-up to the England National Game XI in February 2004, although it was to be his only cap for the semi-professional national team. In November 2004, Miller played for Aldershot against the reserve team of Queens Park Rangers, the team he had supported since childhood."]}]}}
