He played as a goalkeeper.\nRoach was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. He played football for local clubs and in the army before joining Small Heath in 1895, by which time he was over 30. He made his debut on 7 September 1895 in a 7\u20133 defeat at Aston Villa, and retained the starting place for a run of games which included several more heavy defeats, until relinquishing it to William Meates halfway through the season. He then went on to play for Hereford Town and Bristol Eastville Rovers.Roach died in Birmingham in 1955 aged about 91.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Partridge (footballer)", "response": ["Partridge was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire. He played football for Wednesbury Old Athletic before joining Small Heath in 1890. He played two games in Small Heath's second season in the Football Alliance, as a replacement for Chris Charsley and once in their second season in the Football League, replacing George Hollis.Matthews, pp. 141\u201343. In the 1894\u201395 season, the club's first in the First Division, Partridge was first-choice goalkeeper, and had the dubious honour of being in goal for the club's record defeat, 9\u20131, away to Blackburn Rovers in January 1895.Matthews, p. 143. He lost his place the following season to Jim Roach, and went on to play for a variety of clubs in the Black Country, Birmingham and north Worcestershire."]}, {"page": "William Meates", "response": ["Meates was born in Bournemouth, which was then in Hampshire. He began his football career with Eastbourne before joining Small Heath in 1895. He took over from Jim Roach as first-team goalkeeper in the middle of the 1895\u201396 season after the club had suffered some heavy defeats. Meates made his debut on 3 February 1896 in a 3\u20130 defeat at Everton, and retained the starting place for the remainder of the season, but failed to stop the rot sufficiently for Small Heath to avoid relegation via the test match system.Matthews, p. 143. He played only twice the next season, having surrendered the goalkeeper's jersey to Ernest Pointer,Matthews, p. 144. and left for Warmley of the Southern League in 1897. The following year he had an unsuccessful trial with Nottingham Forest."]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["With Joe Fall still unavailable because of an injury sustained in pre-season training, Charles Partridge was replaced in goal by reserve Jim Roach, who made an eventful debut at local rivals Aston Villa. According to the Birmingham Daily Post, he should take no blame for any of the five goals conceded before half-time, due in part to the sun in his eyes and with the half-backs \"little more than landmarks on the field\". On change of ends, the balance of play tilted towards the visitors, but the match still finished 7\u20133. Fall returned to fitness for Small Heath's third defeat of the season, at home to Stoke in a game characterised by excessive foul play. At Nottingham Forest, Tommy Hands and Jack Hallam were lively on the wings, but the weakness of the half-back line was noted in yet another loss."]}, {"page": "Jim Roach", "response": ["* Jim Roach (footballer) (1864\u20131955), English footballer", "* Jim Roach (producer) (born 1977), American producer and songwriter"]}]}}
