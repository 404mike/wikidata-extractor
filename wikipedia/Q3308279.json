He studied history at Oxford, and taught in Exeter, then Nottingham from 1967 to 2002, specialising in French medieval history.\nHe is a member of many British and Breton historical societies, including the Royal Historical Society (1971), la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Histoire et d'Arch\u00e9ologie de Bretagne (1972), Society of Antiquaries of London (1977), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Etudes et de Recherches sur le Pays de Retz (1985), Society for the Study of French History. He is a member of the Breton L'Ordre de l'Hermine and Correspondant de l'Institut.  He is also a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.Most of his works are about the ducal period of Brittany, but since his retirement he has also taken an interest in the local history of Nottinghamshire, especially that relating to Southwell Minster.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Bosworth Field", "response": ["Discontent with Richard's actions manifested itself in the summer after he took control of the country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king."]}, {"page": "Continuation War", "response": ["In the early stages of the war, the Finnish Army overran the former 1939 border, but ceased their advance  from the center of Leningrad. Multiple authors have stated that Finland participated in the siege of Leningrad (), but the full extent and nature of their participation is debated and a clear consensus has yet to emerge. American historian David Glantz, writes that the Finnish Army generally maintained their lines and contributed little to the siege from 1941 to 1944, whereas Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov stated in 2002 that Finland tacitly supported Hitler's starvation policy for the city. However, in 2009 British historian Michael Jones refuted Baryshnikov's claim and asserted that the Finnish Army cut off the city's northern supply routes but did not take further military action. In 2006, American author Lisa A.

The county was valued at 800 marks per annum, although the historian Michael Jones has suggested that due to the war, in real terms \"the amount of revenue that could be extracted\u00a0... must have been considerably lower\".

The most famous is the so-called Rescript of Honorius, in which the Western Emperor Honorius tells the British civitates to look to their own defence. The first reference to this rescript is written by the 6th century Byzantine scholar Zosimus and is found in the middle of a discussion of southern Italy; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some, though not all, modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to Bruttium in Italy.Birley, Anthony Richard The Roman Government of Britain OUP Oxford (29 Sep 2005)  pp.461-463 Halsall, Guy Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568 Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition (20 Dec 2007)  pp.217-218Discussion in Martin Millett, The Romanization of Britain, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' Britannia vol. 13, 1982 p. 260 The Gallic Chronicles, Chronica Gallica of 452 and Chronica Gallica of 511, say prematurely that \"Britain, abandoned by the Romans, passed into the power of the Saxons\" and provide information about St Germanus and his visit(s) to Britain, though again this text has received considerable academic deconstruction.Michael Jones and John Casey, 'The Gallic Chronicle Restored: A Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain', Britannia 19, (1988), pp.367-98; R.W. Burgess, 'The Dark Ages Return to Fifth-Century Britain: The 'Restored' Gallic Chronicle Exploded', Britannia 21, (1990), pp.185-195 The work of Procopius, another 6th-century Byzantine writer, makes some references to Britain, though the accuracy of these is uncertain.", "The traditional view has been partly deconstructed (considerably in some circles) since the 1990s, with a reduction in the numbers of Anglo-Saxons believed to have arrived in Britain. A lower figure is sometimes accepted, which would mean that it is highly unlikely that the existing British population was substantially displaced by the Anglo-Saxons.Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, pp.8-38. If fewer Anglo-Saxons arrived, it is proposed that they formed a ruling elite, with acculturation of the local population. Thus some \"Saxon\" graves may be of Britons, though many scholars disagree.Andrew Tyrrell, Corpus Saxon in Social Identity in Early Medieval Britain by Andrew Tyrrell and William O. Frazer (London: Leicester University Press. 2000)", "There is some controversy as to why Roman rule ended in Britain. The view first advocated by Theodor Mommsen was that Rome left Britain.See discussion in Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996), pp.256-7 This argument was substantiated over time, most recently by A.S. Esmonde-Cleary.Esmonde-Cleary, The Ending of Roman Britain, p.161 According to this argument, internal turmoil in the Roman Empire and the need to withdraw troops to fight off barbarian armies led Rome to abandon Britain. It was the collapse of the imperial system that led to the end of imperial rule in Britain. However, Michael Jones has advanced an alternative thesis that argues that Rome did not leave Britain, but that Britain left Rome.Michael Jones, The End of Roman Britain, esp. chapters 4 and 7 He highlights the numerous usurpers who came from Britain in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, and points out that the supply of coinage to Britain had dried up by the early 5th century, so that administrators and troops were not getting paid. All of this, he argues, led the British people to rebel against Rome. Both of these arguments are open to criticism, and the question is still open.", "There is evidence for climate change in the 5th century, with conditions turning cooler and wetter. This shortened the growing season and made uplands unsuited to growing grain. Dendrochronology reveals a particular climatic event in 540.Davey, 'The Environs of South Cadbury', p.50 Michael Jones suggests that declining agricultural production from land that was already fully exploited had considerable demographic consequences.Jones, The End of Roman Britain, pp.186-243"]}, {"page": "1940 in Wales", "response": ["**Michael Jones, medieval historian"]}, {"page": "List of Breton historians", "response": ["Most historians of Brittany are French historians, apart from Michael Jones.", "* Michael Jones"]}, {"page": "Michael Jones", "response": ["*Michael Jones (Canadian musician) (1942-2022), new-age pianist", "*Michael Jones (film director) (1944\u20132018), Canadian screenwriter", "*Michael Jones (Welsh-French musician) (born 1952)", "*Michael Jones (actor) (born 1987), American voice actor", "*Michael Jones (1959\u20132016), birth name of American musician Kashif", "*Michael Jones (born 1980), birth name of American rapper Wax", "*Michael Jones (English footballer) (born 1987), English footballer", "*Michael Jones (New Zealand footballer)", "*Michael Jones (rugby union) (born 1965), New Zealand rugby union player and coach", "*Michael Jones (boxer) (born 1974), English boxer of the 1990s and 2000s", "*Michael Jones (swimmer) (born 1994), British Paralympic swimmer", "*Michael Jones (cricketer) (born 1998), Scottish cricketer", "*Michael Jones (soldier) (died 1649), colonel during the Irish Confederate War", "*Michael Jones (public administrator) (1895\u20131978), New Zealand interpreter and broadcaster", "*Michael Jones (historian) (born 1940), British historian", "*Michael Jones, Lord Jones (1948\u20132016), Scottish judge", "*Michael Jones (activist) (born 1964), American psychology writer and practitioner", "*Michael Jones (scientist), computer vision researcher", "*Michael Jones (entrepreneur) (born 1975), American entrepreneur and investor", "*Michael Jones (priest) (died 1719), Anglican priest in Ireland "]}, {"page": "Cambrian Archaeological Association", "response": ["* 2020 Professor Michael Jones"]}, {"page": "The Society for the Study of French History", "response": ["The society's trustees include Richard Bonney, Malcolm Crook, William Doyle, Michael Jones and Pamela Pilbeam."]}]}}
