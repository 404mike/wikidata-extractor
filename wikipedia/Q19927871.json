Wodhull's architect is unknown. The style is Palladian although with earlier Carolean echoes which led Pevsner to describe it as \"decidedly conservative for its date\". Construction took place between 1761 and 1765.  Since the 1970s, the house has been the country home of Michael Heseltine who has constructed a notable arboretum in the grounds. Thenford House is a Grade I listed building.", "Michael Wodhull was born in Thenford, Northamptonshire in 1740. His parents were wealthy landowners and he never worked. His principal occupations were book collecting and the translation of Ancient Greek texts. In 1761, aged 21, he began the building of a new house at Thenford, to replace the Elizabethan manor house. By 1765 the house was complete. In the same year Wodhull married Catherine Milcah, daughter of a Warwickshire vicar. Wodhull died without heirs in 1816 and the Thenford estate passed to his wife's sister."]}]}}
