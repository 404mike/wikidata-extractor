He set out a baseline in the Swartland plain north of present-day Darling. Using triangulation he then measured a 137\u00a0km arc of meridian between Cape Town and Aurora, determining the astronomical latitudes of the end points by means of astronomical-geodetic observations. There is a memorial to his work at a location near Aurora, pictured here.  His result suggested that the earth was more flattened towards the south pole than towards the north. George Everest, of the Indian Survey, while recuperating from an illness at the Cape nearly seventy years later, suggested that Lacaille's latitude observations had been affected by the deflection of the vertical, caused by gravitational attraction of Table Mountain at the southern end and by the Piketberg Mountain at the northern. In 1838, Thomas Maclear, who was Astronomer Royal at the Cape, repeated the measurements over a longer baseline (Maclear's arc measurement) and ultimately confirmed Everest's conjecture.  Maclear's Beacon was erected on the Table Mountain in Cape Town to help with the verification."]}, {"page": "Sirius", "response": ["Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson used his observations made in 1832\u20131833 and South African astronomer Thomas Maclear's observations made in 1836\u20131837, to determine that the value of the parallax was 0.23 arcsecond, and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or as Henderson wrote in 1839, \"On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less.\" Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25 arcsecond for much of the 19th century.
