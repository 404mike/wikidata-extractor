In 2000, he joined the Aston Villa Academy and continued his development. In 2004, he joined Burnley on a season-long loan, where he performed well before returning to make his Aston Villa debut. Later, he signed for hometown club Sheffield United on a three-month loan deal. On 30 January 2008, he signed for Bolton Wanderers for approximately \u00a35 million. Cahill performed well for Bolton through the years, cementing a place in the first team. He made 130 league appearances and scored 13 league goals for Bolton. In January 2012, Cahill signed for Chelsea for approximately \u00a37 million. He won the UEFA Champions League in his debut season at Chelsea, and went on to win the UEFA Europa League twice, the Premier League twice, the FA Cup twice and the League Cup. Following his release in 2019, Cahill joined fellow London club Crystal Palace on a free transfer. He left the club after two seasons in 2021.\nCahill is an England international with over 60 caps, and represented the nation in England tournament squads for the FIFA World Cups of 2014 and 2018, and the UEFA European Championship in 2012 and 2016, though he withdrew injured from the 2012 event. He was eligible to play for either England or the Republic of Ireland, but chose to play for England. In June 2009, Cahill was called up to the England squad for the match against Kazakhstan; however, he only made his debut on 3 September 2010, coming on as a substitute against Bulgaria. He made his first start for the national team on 29 March 2011, in the friendly against Ghana. He scored his first international goal against Bulgaria, in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 19", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Gary Cahill, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1985", "response": ["* December 19 \u2013 Gary Cahill, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Rio Ferdinand", "response": ["Ferdinand was left out of Roy Hodgson's squad for Euro 2012, leading to strong speculation this was to avoid potential conflict with John Terry, who was included in the squad, due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.

For example, a clearance is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender's goal. Due to the many skills centre-backs are required to possess in the modern game, many successful contemporary central-defensive partnerships have involved pairing a more physical defender with a defender who is quicker, more comfortable in possession and capable of playing the ball out from the back; examples of such pairings have included David Luiz, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho with Chelsea, Sergio Ramos, Rapha\u00ebl Varane or Pepe with Real Madrid, Nemanja Vidi\u0107 and Rio Ferdinand with Manchester United, or Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Medhi Benatia with Juventus."]}, {"page": "Northern England", "response": ["Many of the powerhouses of English football came from the North \u2013 as of the 2020\u201321 season, of the 123 top-flight league titles since 1888, 83 (67%) have been won by teams based north of Crewe.

Having featured predominantly as a left-sided player during the early stages of his career, Burnley manager Steve Cotterill hoped Whittingham would make an impact as a central midfielder at the club, and hoped that he would do as well as Gary Cahill, another young player they had taken on loan from Villa. Whittingham made his debut for Burnley in a 1\u20131 draw with Crewe Alexandra the following day.

On 24 December, Sinclair signed a new two-year contract extension until June 2007, with \"Clarets\" manager Steve Cotterill stating that \"he has been an integral part of our defence\".

Hodgson would defend his decision to leave out Ferdinand as due to \"footballing reasons\", citing Ferdinand's lack of appearances for the national team, his last cap having come in June 2011 and also concerns over his fitness. Ferdinand's manager Sir Alex Ferguson agreed with Hodgson, saying that at the Euros, \"you play something like a game every four days. Rio Ferdinand couldn't do that\". Speculation was rife that Ferdinand was not selected due to Hodgson not wanting both Ferdinand and John Terry in the same dressing room when Terry was due to undergo trial in July for allegedly racially abusing Ferdinand's brother, Anton. After injury ruled centre-back Gary Cahill out of the squad, Hodgson elected to pick full-back Martin Kelly over Ferdinand, leading to Ferdinand's representative Jamie Moralee accusing Hodgson of disrespecting Ferdinand. Hodgson said about the decision that \"When it came to bringing another player in, I wasn't going to bring in a player of Rio's age, class, background and experience to be a cover player. I had to be convinced, if I was going to take Rio in my 23, he'd be one of the first names on the team sheet.

In England's next match against Sweden, Hart put on an uncertain performance, letting in a saveable long-range free kick and then a 30-yard bicycle kick from Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 following a poor headed clearance.

This system depends on the constant positional movement of attacking players, with the two wide forwards moving inside when the full-backs make overlapping forward runs, thus effectively forming a 3\u20134\u20133 and at times a 3\u20134\u20131\u20132. When losing the ball, players' quick defensive transitions make the system easily transform into a compact 5\u20134\u20131. Chelsea's performances improved dramatically after the tactical change, with 13 consecutive wins in the Premier League, and the club eventually went on to win the league title that season. Conte drew praise for his role in revitalising the team in the media, with BBC pundit John Motson describing Chelsea's 5\u20130 home win against Everton on 5 November 2016 as the best 90-minute performance he had ever seen in the Premier League."]}, {"page": "1985 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 December \u2013 Gary Cahill, English footballer"]}]}}
