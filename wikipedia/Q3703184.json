Advancing  in two days, the division reached Rouen to find it defended by three French tanks which managed to destroy a number of German tanks before being taken out. The German force, enraged by this resistance, forbade fire brigade access to the burning district of the old Norman capital, and as a result most of the historic quarter was reduced to ashesThree German Invasions of France: The Summers Campaigns of 1830, 1914, 1940 Douglas Fermer page 210, Pen & Sword 2013 According to David Fraser, Rommel instructed the German artillery to bombard the city as a \"fire demonstration\"Knight's Cross: A Life of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel by David Fraser, 1993  \u2013 Page 198, David Fraser \u2013 1993 \"Rommel planned to send a force to a crossroads a few miles east of Rouen from which a powerful fire demonstration could be opened towards Rouen itself\".

Lippincott Company, 1944 \"On the tenth and eleventh of June the docks of Rouen were burned and an enormous cloud of black smoke settled over Paris. Rumour had it that the smoke was to hide the movements of the evacuees and to blind the German advance, but in our hearts we knew the truth, simply and terribly that Rouen was burning.\" Daniel Allen Butler states that the bridges to the city were already destroyed. Historians note that after the fall of the city both French civilians of Black African descent and colonial troops were executed on 9 June, without mentioning the unit of the perpetrators.Les Tirailleurs s\u00e9n\u00e9galais; Les soldats noirs entre l\u00e9gendes et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s 1939\u20131945 by Julien Fargetta, Tallandier 2012 Lyon ne constitue pas un cas unique puisque, \u00e0 l'issue de la chute de Rouen, le 9 juin 1940, des ex\u00e9cutions de civils de couleur sont mentionn\u00e9es, \"Lyon is not a unique case since, after the fall of Rouen, on June 9, 1940, executions of colored civilians are mentioned\".Rouen sous l'occupation: 1940\u20131944, Patrick Coiffier, page 6, Bertout, 2004 Tous les hommes de couleur sont regroup\u00e9s [...] Ils seront tous conduits sur les hauteurs, dans une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e au n\u00b0 11 rue de Bihorel o\u00f9 ils seront massacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la mitrailleuse. \"All the men of color are grouped together [...] They will all be taken to the heights, to a property located at 11 rue de Bihorel where they will be massacred with a machine gun.\"Paroles de r\u00e9sistance \u2013 Page 75, Jean Pierre Brul\u00e9, ditions de la Veytizou, 2003 A Rouen, d\u00e8s le 9 juin 1940, les premiers d\u00e9tachements Allemands entr\u00e9s dans la ville s'empar\u00e8rent de civils d'origine africaine et, dans le parc d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils avaient install\u00e9 un PC, 11 rue de Bihorel, ils les abattirent \u00e0 la... \"In Rouen, from June 9, 1940, the first German detachments to enter the city seized civilians of African origin and, in the park of a property [...], 11 rue de Bihorel, they shot them down\".

The division advanced  in 24 hours, and after two days of shelling, the French garrison surrendered on 19 June. The speed and surprise that it was consistently able to achieve, to the point at which both the enemy and the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH; German \"High Command  of the Army\") at times lost track of its whereabouts, earned the 7th Panzers the nickname Gespensterdivision (\"ghost division\")."]}, {"page": "July 15", "response": ["*  2012   \u2013 David Fraser, English general (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "Operation Market Garden", "response": ["Rick Atkinson wrote that while \"one-fifth of the Netherlands had been liberated \u2026 the rest would endure another nine months of occupation\", which resulted in 16,000 civilian deaths. Atkinson stated that the terrain captured \"led nowhere\", and that the operation failed to achieve its objectives due to \"an epic cock-up [of] poor plan[ing] with deficient intelligence, haphazard execution, and indifferent generalship\". Carlo D'Este wrote \"What had begun with high optimism had turned into a military disaster\", and that despite the heroics at Arnhem bridge, the operation \"failed to establish a bridgehead north of the Rhine\". D'Este argued that this resulted in a stalemate through winter, which saw lengthy attritional battles that obtained little significant territory and caused high casualties. David Fraser wrote that Market Garden was a strategic failure. Stephen Ashley Hart stated that the operation was \"partly unsuccessful\", and that Montgomery \"immediately reconstituted the Second (British) Army so that it could launch Operation Gatwick, an eastward thrust intended to reach the Rhine near Krefeld\". This second attempt was cancelled due to the \"precarious state of the \u2026 salient and the failure to clear the flank-threatening enemy salient at Venlo\". Michael Reynolds wrote that \"With the war still in progress, it was inevitable that Market-Garden would be presented to the British and American people as a victory.\", but stated \"In reality, it was a strategic failure\" that failed to obtain the desired objectives. Reynolds stated \"The salient achieved led nowhere and was to prove extremely costly in the coming months\", and that \"The seven [British commanders] most directly involved \u2026 bear responsibility for the failure of the Operation. It is also clear that, whilst the German commanders were prepared to take all necessary measures and risk to win the battle, even to point of using men untrained in ground warfare, their British adversaries were [not]\". Milton Shulman wrote that the \"airborne operation had achieved some useful results\" by driving a wedge into the German position and \"thereby isolating the Fifteenth Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army on the eastern side of the bulge. This segregation from the rest of the German front complicated the supply problem of Fifteenth Army, which was to forced to rely on the inferior crossings over the Maas and the Waal rivers west of the Allied penetration.\" Shulman stated that the terrain captured \"served as an important base for subsequent operations against the Germans on the Rhine\", ensured the Allied forces maintained the initiative, forced the Germans to remain on the defensive and ensured they could not assemble enough forces for a counterattack towards Antwerp, and stated that German Fifteenth Army commander called the loss of bridges and terrain as \"a great embarrassment to us\".Milton Shulamn, Defeat in the West, p.210 Chester Wilmot stated that the captured terrain was \"of immense tactical value\", which removed \"the threat of an immediate counter-stroke against Antwerp; strategically, however, it was in danger of becoming a blind alley, unless the bridgeheads over the Maas and the Wall could be quickly exploited.\" However, Wilmot noted that the operation failed to achieve its actual objectives, and that Montgomery's claim of a 90 per cent success \"is difficult to support, unless the success of the operation is judged merely in terms of the number of bridges captured.\" Citing the commander of the First Parachute Army, Wilmot stated that the weather was the main contributing factor to the failure of the operation. John Warren wrote that \"the greatest airborne operation of the war\" had \"ended in failure\", which had saw \"all objectives save Arnhem \u2026 won, but without Arnhem the rest were as nothing.\" Gerhard Weinberg wrote \"At the end of ten days of bitter fighting \u2026 the attempt to 'bounce' the [Rhine] had failed by a narrow margin in the face of reviving Germany resistance\"."]}, {"page": "2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["On 3\u00a0September 1939, the UK declared war on Germany, in response to the German invasion of Poland.

He went to 161 Officer Cadet Training Unit (161 OCTU) in the buildings of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where one of his colleagues was David Fraser. At Sandhurst, he was critical of the war, which he said had been unnecessary.Fraser, David. Wars and Shadows, Memoirs of General Sir David Fraser, pub Allen Lane, 2002.  pp. 151\u2013158. Douglas-Home was commissioned in the Buffs in March 1941. While an officer he stood in the three parliamentary by-elections.", "In 1988, Douglas-Home was roused to challenge his cashiering for disobeying orders, in the wake of an article in The Times, prompted by the election of Kurt Waldheim as the president of Austria. The article attacked Waldheim, who was claimed to have been a Schutzstaffel (SS Officer) in the Greek theatre of war, supervising the loading of prisoners who were being transported north for imprisonment or worse. The article asserted that Waldheim should have disobeyed those orders. It was argued that if Waldheim had disobeyed those orders he would have been punished and probably executed. Douglas-Home accordingly applied for a pardon and was told that he had to petition the War Office to reverse the sentence of the Court Martial. He was supported in his efforts by the military law expert Professor Gerald Draper OBE, who died in the midst of preparing the arguments supporting the petition. His argument was that the attack on Le Havre was morally indefensible, because of the failure to evacuate civilians and that even though he was not engaged directly in attacking those civilians, he was entitled to refuse to take part in the operation or to support it. It was Professor Draper who had discovered that the current edition of the Manual of Military Law had not been available to the October 1944 Field Court Martial. The duty on a soldier not to obey an illegal order, because a morally indefensible operation rendered all orders underpinning it illegal, did not find favour with the War Office, which focused solely on the order, which Douglas-Home had never denied he had disobeyed. Sir David Fraser's take on it was that he did not question Douglas-Home's courage but he had disobeyed an order and he was properly punished for doing so.Andrew Knapp; \"The Destruction and Liberation of Le Havre in Modern Memory\" (War in History, 2007)"]}, {"page": "Royal Hampshire Regiment", "response": ["*1981\u20131987: Gen.
