As a post-war student in the University of Wales at Aberystwyth and Bangor, she gained a degree in agriculture, a first-class honours in botany, and a PhD in island ecology. She lectured in the universities of Exeter (Devon), Massey (New Zealand), Melbourne (Australia), Kano (Nigeria), and worked in the Adult Education Department at University College Cardiff from 1961 until her retirement in 1988.As a teacher of adult amateur naturalists, she saw her role as an interpreter of scientific data for the layman, and took to writing books and popular articles. Spray-washed seabird colonies were her main love, and research on these took her to remote islands in many parts of the world, where she has lived in tents, huts, lighthouses, etc. Her major research projects were around the coasts of West Wales (her PhD thesis), Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and she was one of the first women scientists to join an Antarctic expedition (in 1959/60).In 1970, she undertook a research project on Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, and subsequently took naturalists to the Seychelles. In 1979, she was visiting scientist on an American expedition (by sailing ship) to an uninhabited island in the Bahamas, and she took parties to Jamaica, New England, and the Rocky Mountains. Other expeditions were to North, West, East, and Central Africa, and Florida, and she led groups to various parts of Britain and Europe. Active in various natural history and conservation bodies over several decades, Gillham was president of the Glamorgan Naturalists' Trust and of the Cardiff Naturalists Society.\nIn 2008, Gillham was awarded an MBE for services to nature conservation in South Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gwaelod-y-Garth", "response": ["*Dr. Mary Gillham, one of the first women to visit Antarctica in 1959."]}, {"page": "Gillham", "response": ["*Mary Gillham (1921\u20132013), English naturalist and writer"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 November \u2013 Mary Gillham, naturalist (died 2013)"]}, {"page": "Isobel Bennett", "response": ["Isobel Ida Bennett AO 1984 (9 July 1909 \u2013 12 January 2008) was one of Australia's best-known marine biologists.

Following Dakin's death in 1950, she saw the book through to publication in 1952, and she continued to revise and reprint it with a complete revision in 1980 until 1992. In later editions, she was listed as a co-author, then first author.  She also wrote nine other books, and was one of the first women (along with Susan Ingham, Mary Gillham & Hope Macpherson) to go south with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE)..
