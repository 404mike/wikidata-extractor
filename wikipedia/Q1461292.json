Tregonning wrote a book about his travel to Jesselton from Singapore in a book titled \"North Borneo\" (1960). Various other American films have been taken in the state, such as the \"Three Came Home\" (1950), a Hollywood film based on the memoir of Agnes Newton Keith in her book depicting the situation of World War II in Sandakan. Keith also wrote three other books about the state, such as \"Land Below the Wind\", \"White Man Returns\" and \"Beloved Exiles\". A Japanese film called \"Sandakan No. 8\" (1974) directed by Kei Kumai tells the story of prostitution by Karayuki-san in Sandakan Japanese brothel based on the 1972 book Sandakan Brothel No. 8: An Episode in the History of Lower-Class by Yamazaki Tomoko. In the Earl Mac Rauch novelisation of the American \"Buckaroo Banzai\" novel (Pocket Books, 1984; repr. 2001), as well in the DVD film, Buckaroo's archenemy Hanoi Xan is said to have his secret base in Sabah, in a \"relic city of caves\". \"Bat*21\" (1988), another American film depicting the Vietnam War was shot at various locations in the suburbs north of Kota Kinabalu, including Menggatal, Telipok, Kayu Madang and Lapasan. Another English author Redmond O'Hanlon also wrote a book titled \"Into the Heart of Borneo\" (1984) about Borneo island.

But in his view, Barley's writing has survived the test of time \"in a postcolonial world\" far better than O'Hanlon's, not least because, as an anthropologist, his observations on the people he wrote about were underpinned by \"professional fieldwork ... proper language training and research\". Hannigan found Barley's prose \"effortlessly jaunty ..  with an air of permanent good-natured amusement.

Marshall, Irish Tories, Rapparees and Robbers; With Some Account of the Most Notable, Tyrone Printing Company, Dungannon, 1927. Page 23. Stephen Dunford has further dubbed O'Hanlon, \"The Irish Skanderbeg.\"", "According to John J. Marshall, Of the childhood and upbringing of the famous outlaw we have no reliable account, but a very rare pamphlet on the life and death of Redmond O'Hanlon, dated 1st August 1681 and published in Dublin, 1682, states that \"Redmond, son of Loghlin O'Hanlon, was born near Poyntzpass in the County of Armagh in the year 1640,\" but some of the later lives say he was born at the foot of Slieve Gullion, and local tradition confirms this. \"It was his good fortune to be educated in an English school where he attained to such perfection in that language that it might have proved a great advantage to him in the afterlife.\" His linguistic accomplishments certainly did prove useful to him in the afterlife. He is represented as a most accomplished gentleman, equal to Ossory, who was accounted for manners and bearing the finest cavalier since Sir Philip Sidney. He was also an excellent actor and mimic, able to personate a King's officer, merchant or countryman, as the exigencies of the case required. In one of the contemporary pamphlets, there is given what is most evidently a fictitious account of his youth and early days in which he is represented as a being a footman for Sir George Acheson of Markethill, and while in the gentleman's employment practising himself in all the accounts of roguery. Cosgrave's account seems quite probable when he says \u2013 \"Redmond once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and flying for safety, stayed abroad for a long time, still refusing to come to a trial, till he was outlawed, which put him into his shifts.\" It is likely that O'Hanlon fled to France and there joined the Army where he acquired which he so often turned to good use in his after-career, and also was able to speak French like a native, Gaelic and English being equally at his command.Marshall (1927), page 24.", "Although Redmond O'Hanlon has often been compared to a real-life Robin Hood, he has much more in common with Rob Roy MacGregor.", "In 1674 the authorities in Dublin Castle put a price on Redmond O'Hanlon and several other known outlaws. In 1676, the price was increased, with posters advertising for his capture, dead or alive.Marshall page 26.", "In a pamphlet printed in London as propaganda for the Titus Oates Plot, Father Murphy alleged that the Count responded by threatening Father Murphy with dire consequences if he did not desist. When Father Murphy ignored the warning, O'Hanlon decreed that any parishioner who attended a Mass offered by the Rector of Killeavy would be fined one cow for the first offence, two for the second offence, and for the third offence would be killed. After this threat was carried out against two Killeavy parishioners, Father Murphy arranged for another priest to take his place and began to spend an increasing amount of time plotting vengeance against Redmond O'Hanlon.Marshall (1927), page 28.", "Henry St. John also earned Redmond's undying hatred by continuing his uncle's policy of evicting the Count's clansmen en masse and replacing them with Scotch-Irish Protestants. In response, Redmond O'Hanlon retaliated by ordering the mass theft of Henry St. John's livestock and the armed robbery of his factors and rent collectors.", "Seething with hatred, Henry St. John began waging a private war against the O'Hanlon Gang. The death of his nineteen-year-old son from a chill gained while pursuing the Count only made Henry St. John increasingly brutal toward anyone suspected of aiding Redmond O'Hanlon.", "The full text of Reverend Power's sermon was printed by in London as propaganda for the Titus Oates Plot. It was given the name, \"The Righteous Man's Portion.\" Reverend Power also began sending letters to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, and pleaded with him to destroy Redmond O'Hanlon. He further named several prominent aristocrats and Crown officials who had regular dealings with local outlaws.", "In one such letter, Rev. Power wrote, \"Their chief Redmond O'Hanlon is described as a cunning, dangerous fellow, who, though proclaimed an outlaw along with the rest of his crew and sums of money on their heads, yet he reigns and keeps in subjection so far that is credibly reported, he raises more in a year by contribution than the King's Land, Taxes, and Chimney-Money come to; and thereby is enabled to bribe Clerks and Officers, if not their masters, and makes all to much truckle for him.\"Dunford (2001), page 276.", "According to Ulster's oral tradition, Redmond O'Hanlon travelled to visit his family in Letterkenny, County Donegal, where they were prospering as merchants under the protection of the Chief of Clan O'Doherty and Sir John Conyngham, whose brother David had married the Count's sister. Redmond O'Hanlon remained in Donegal until the heat died down over Henry St. John's assassination. Also according to legend, he had a dalliance with Sir John's daughter.", "According to John J. Marshall, Redmond O'Hanlon was offered a full pardon by Rev. Henry Jones, the Church of Ireland's Welsh-born Bishop of Meath. Bishop Jones, who Marshall describes as, \"an ultra-Protestant,\" was interested in using the outlaw Count as a witness against Archbishop Plunkett and other alleged Catholic traitors.Marshall (1927), pages 32\u201333.", "As persecution of Catholics heated up in reaction to the Titus Oates plot, a priest named Father Mac Aidghalle was murdered while saying Mass at a Mass rock that still stands atop Slieve Gullion. The perpetrators were a band of redcoats under the command of a priest hunter named Turner. Redmond O'Hanlon is said in local tradition to have avenged the murdered priest and in so doing to have sealed his own fate. Tony Nugent (2013), Were You at the Rock?

Hoping to make him the protagonist of an adventure novel, Scott corresponded with Lady Olivia Sparrow, an Anglo-Irish landowner from County Down. Although Scott asked Lady Sparrow to obtain as much information as possible about O'Hanlon, he was forced to give up on the project after finding documentation too scanty.D. J.

One of Carleton's biographers alleges that the novelist glorified a 17th-century rapparee because he did not feel able to praise the Ribbonmen of his own era. According to O'Donoghue, however, Carleton's novel does not depict the historical Redmond O'Hanlon, but rather a figure of his own imagination.O'Donoghue (1905), page 11.", "More recently, Count Redmond O'Hanlon's name is mentioned in The Ballad of Douglas Bridge by Francis Carlin.
