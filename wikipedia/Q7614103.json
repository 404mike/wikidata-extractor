With a new artificial pitch laid and John McGrath at the helm Preston stormed to promotion with John finishing the season as the club's leading scorer. The rumour however of a fall out with manager McGrath only increased with Thomas being dropped several times during the season to be replaced by the likes of Nigel Jemson, Frank Worthington and Steve Taylor. He did though every time regain his place in the team, ending the season with an excellent 28 goals. At the end of his contract in July 1987 he was sold much to the fans dismay to Bolton Wanderers for a bargain \u00a330,000 after finding the net 38 times in just 78 games."]}, {"page": "Vic Halom", "response": ["Halom moved into management in the early 1980s managing Bergs\u00f8y IL in Norway. He later achieved great success with Barrow taking them back into the Vauxhall Conference in 1983\u201384. This led to him being appointed Rochdale manager at the end of the season. Halom began with a mass clear out, many of the incomers being ex-Oldham players. The side struggled to gel at first but things markedly improved when the under-performing record signing Les Lawrence was sold and replaced by proven goalscorer Steve Taylor late in 1984. For the next calendar year Rochdale showed promotion-winning form and earned a third round FA Cup tie with Manchester United."]}, {"page": "List of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Div 2 || 42 || 13 || 16 || 13 || 54 || 58 || 42 || 8th || R3 || R3 || || Anglo-Scottish Cup || GS || Steve Taylor || 21"]}]}}
