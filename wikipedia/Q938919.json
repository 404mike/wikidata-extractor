In 1825 he graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge, and in the same year he took holy orders. In 1832 he became a clergyman in the Madeira Islands, where he was also a part-time naturalist, extensively studying the local flora and fauna. He wrote a book on the Madeiran flora. He died in 1874 when the ship he was on was wrecked off the Scilly Isles.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Percy Lowe (1870\u20131948), English ornithologistAbbreviation in zoology: Lowe (also used for Richard Thomas Lowe) who worked on fossil ostriches in China"]}, {"page": "John Stevens Henslow", "response": ["Besides Darwin, other famous students of Henslow included Miles Joseph Berkeley, Cardale Babington, Leonard Jenyns,Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement, \"Jenyns, Leonard\" Richard Thomas Lowe and William Hallowes Miller."]}, {"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*Richard Thomas Lowe (1802\u20131874) United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Lowe \u2013 Richard Thomas Lowe (1802\u20131874)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Vernon Wollaston", "response": ["In 1857 Wollaston returned to the North Atlantic islands, investigating the natural history of the Canary Islands \u2013 with Richard Thomas Lowe and John Edward Gray in 1858, returning with Lowe alone in 1859.

He based his description on a specimen caught off Madeira in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. However, Lowe's description was subsequently overlooked by researchers and this species was known by different names until the 1940s, when new specimens from Cuba and Florida prompted its original scientific name to be resurrected. The specific epithet superciliosus is from the Latin super meaning \"above\", and ciliosus meaning \"eyebrow\", referring to the distinct lateral grooves above the eyes.Jensen, C. Bigeye Thresher.

The smooth lanternshark forms a species group with the blurred lanternshark (E. bigelowi); these two species are distinguished from other lantern sharks by their irregularly arranged, truncated (ending in a flat crown as though the tip were cut off) dermal denticles."]}]}}
