Toshack had been born in Cardiff and began his career with the side but his subsequent success with the Swans, winning promotion from the Fourth Division to the First Division during his tenure, saw the balance of power in South Wales shift. Having only played each other five times during the 1970s, all in the Welsh Cup, the two sides met in a league fixture for the first time in for 15 years in 1980. Swansea recorded a 2\u20131 victory with goals coming from two former Cardiff players, Toshack, in his role as player-manager, and David Giles.", "In the 1950s and 1960s, the two sides saw several players feature for both sides during their careers, including some of the most noted Welsh players of the era, such as Trevor Ford, Ivor Allchurch and Mel Charles. However, as the animosity between the two clubs has worsened, players have sometimes received a hostile reception when playing for both sides of the divide. Dave Penney captained Swansea during the 1997 Football League Third Division play-off Final and made over 100 appearances for the club before joining Cardiff. Despite this, ahead of his first return to Vetch Field in 2004, he stated that he \"expected stick\" on his return, adding \"Moving from one Welsh club to the other is regarded as the ultimate sin down there.\" Andy Legg joined Cardiff in 1998 having played for Swansea earlier in his career and initially received a hostile reception Cardiff fans. When he attempted to celebrate his first goal for the club in front of home fans, he was met with abuse and even received a razor blade in the post. He later stated, \"I'd say the hatred between (Cardiff and Swansea) fans [...] was the most intense I have come across.\" The rivalry is prevalent among the club's staff as well as fans; David Giles has described how he was warned away from speaking to former friends at Swansea when arriving at Vetch Field as a Cardiff player."]}, {"page": "Soccer Night", "response": ["|| Wales(Axed in December 2005.) || Sam LloydJonny Owen (stand-in)David Giles (analyst)"]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|David Giles||||MF||1982\u20131984||100||6||||"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1980\u20131999)", "response": ["|1982 FIFA World Cup Qualification || Ian Walsh (2), David Giles, Brian Flynn || 10,254", "|1982 FIFA World Cup Qualification || David Giles || 20,175"]}, {"page": "David Giles", "response": ["David Giles may refer to:", "*David Giles (director) (1926\u20132010), British television director", "*David Giles (footballer) (born 1956), Welsh former footballer", "*David Giles (sailor) (born 1964), Australian competitive sailor"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["*  David Giles -  Leyton Orient, December, loan", "| - || MF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  David Giles || 0(+2)"]}, {"page": "Paul Wilkins", "response": ["Wilkins was born in Hackney and began his career at Tottenham Hotspur as an apprentice but did not go on to make a league appearance.
