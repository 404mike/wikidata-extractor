He was a versatile player with power both in the air and in the tackle.\nHe moved from non-league Barry Town to Luton Town in 1970, before joining Carlisle United the following year. Following a loan spell with Workington in 1973, he moved on to Rotherham United. He helped the \"Millers\" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1974\u201375, before joining Chester in October 1975 for \u00a36,000. He was sold on to Port Vale for \u00a330,000 in December 1978, before leaving the English game for American club Miami Americans in 1980. He later had spells with English club Oswestry Town, Welsh club Colwyn Bay, and Hong Kong side Bulova SA.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dennis Butler", "response": ["Following his retirement as a player, he coached at Rochdale and Bury. He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000). After his team were booed he called the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. Vale recorded a \u00a352,000 loss despite a remarkable \u00a3225,000 income from the club's commercial department. Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000. After leaving Burslem, Butler then reunited with Bobby Smith at Swindon, becoming the first team coach before retiring from football in 1980."]}, {"page": "Robert Delgado", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Delgado"]}, {"page": "Robert Allan Delgado", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Delgado"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Going into December four games unbeaten, Butler then splashed out \u00a330,000 on Chester's Bob Delgado.

In January, legendary England goalkeeper Gordon Banks was appointed as coach, and results began to pick up as Vale were lifted into eighth spot. Healy left the club in February, only to return two weeks later. Behind the scenes there was trouble when Arthur McPherson ruled that club shares could only be transferable to a male relation, in order 'to safeguard plans by the current directors'. More defeats came, and the big money signings were targeted by fans for abuse. Butler reacted by calling the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. From mid-March, Vale went seven games with only one victory and one goal scored. On 21 March violence returned to Vale Park, when Portsmouth keeper Peter Mellor saved a penalty, floored Peter Farrell and made an 'assortment of gestures' to the Bycars End \u2013 he found himself attacked by a Vale fan on the pitch for his efforts.
