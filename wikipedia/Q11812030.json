He was the highest scoring Scotsman in the Royal Flying Corps, with 39 victories.\nGilmour began his military career in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, but was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps. Gaining his wings on 17 March 1916, Gilmour was assigned to pilot the Martinsyde Elephant on the Western Front. He was one of the few successful scorers with the clumsy craft, downing three German opponents. He went on to establish a reputation as a crack bomber formation leader. In late 1917, he advanced to flying a Sopwith Camel fighter as a Flight Commander for No. 65 Squadron. Beginning on 18 December 1916, he reeled off a further 36 victories by 3 July 1918. That included five separate victories on 1 July 1918. He was then promoted to major and sent to command No. 28 Squadron in Italy.\nPost war, Gilmour was the air attache in Rome, then was posted to No. 216 Squadron in the Middle East.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gilmour", "response": ["* John Inglis Gilmour (18961928), Scottish flying ace in World War I"]}, {"page": "No. 65 Squadron RAF", "response": ["John Inglis Gilmour, "]}, {"page": "List of aviators who became ace in a day", "response": ["* John Inglis Gilmour of the Royal Air Force successfully brought down five German aircraft in a single day on 1 July 1918.
