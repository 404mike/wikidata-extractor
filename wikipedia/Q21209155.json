He played football for a number of local clubs, including Mawnan, and played as goalkeeper for the county football team.Between 1972 and 1974, Weatherhill served with the RAF, training as a cartographer. He was discharged after a serious back injury. He worked as a planning officer, architectural designer and historic conservation expert in local government and private practice. Under the tutelage of historian P.A.S. Pool he conducted archaeological surveys of West Cornwall. Weatherhill was also a Conservation Officer at Penwith District Council. He contributed to the BBC's Radyo Kernow, in particular to the series The Tinners' Way and Beachcombers.In 1981 Weatherhill was made a Bard of Gorsedh Kernow for services to Cornish archaeology, taking the bardic name Delynyer Hendhyscans (Draughtsman of Archaeology).He was a member of Cornish language organisations Cussel an Tavas Kernuak and Agan Tavas, as well as of campaign group Kernow Matters To You.
