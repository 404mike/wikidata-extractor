On the streets of Polish cities, the non-Jewish population was targeted by the \u0142apanka policy, in which Nazi forces indiscriminately rounded up, kidnapped and murdered civilians.\"With the demands of the German military draining its industrial labour force, where better had Germany to procure replacements than from the defeated and occupied countries? Round-ups, or lapankas, * the Polish name they were known under, became an essential feature of life in Warsaw and precipitated much wider ferocity on both sides. Abroad in public I had survived numerous German security checks, shielded from unpleasant developments by Nazi Labour department registration and other efficient false documents. The round-ups of Poles created an additional threat for me as well as all Poles. Whole streets were sealed off by police and soldiers and most trapped men and women were carted off to concentration camps or sent as slave labour to the Reich. Tram and trainloads of people, regardless of work documents, were herded like cattle into trucks, many never to see home or family again. Being Polish was sufficient to qualify for such treatment.\", Ron Jeffery, \"Red Runs the Vistula\", Nevron Associates Publ., Manurewa, Auckland, New Zealand 1985 In Warsaw, between 1942 and 1944, there were approximately 400 daily victims of \u0142apanka. Tens of thousands of these victims were killed in mass executions, including an estimated 37,000 people at the Pawiak prison complex run by the Gestapo and thousands of others killed in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. The Nazis also held public executions of hostages. Daily lists of Poles to be executed in the event of any attack upon Nazi troopers were published. In retribution for these acts of terrorism, the Polish Underground leadership prepared lists of Nazi leaders to be eliminated for the said crimes against civilian non-combatants.Strzembosz (1983)"]}, {"page": "Stalag XXI-D", "response": ["* Ron Jeffery"]}, {"page": "List of spies in World War II", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Jeffery, Ron\"|Ron Jeffery || || Ron Jeffery by Ben Stacy Jerrik (Editor) - New, Rare & Used Books Online at Alibris Marketplace"]}, {"page": "Roman Antoszewski", "response": ["# Translated into Polish runs the Vistula    ASIN: B0007BQDNU (1985) English historical book of Ron Jeffery - Nevron Associates Publ., Manurewa, Auckland;"]}]}}
