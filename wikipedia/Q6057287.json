His first book, Force of Circumstance and Other Poems was published in 1962; Prynne has excluded it from his canon. His Poems (1982) collected all the work he wanted to keep in print up to the time of publication, beginning with Kitchen Poems (1968). Expanded and updated versions appeared in 1999, 2005, and 2015.  \nPrynne was one of the key figures in the Cambridge group of Revival poets and was a major contributor to The English Intelligencer.\nIn addition to his poetry, Prynne has published some critical and academic prose. A transcription of a 1971 lecture on Olson's Maximus Poems at Simon Fraser University has had wide circulation. His longer works include a monograph on Ferdinand de Saussure, Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words, and self-published book-length commentaries on poems by Wordsworth (Field Notes: 'The Solitary Reaper' and others) and Shakespeare (They That Haue Powre to Hurt; A Specimen of a Commentary on Shake-speares Sonnets, 94). His essay on New Songs from a Jade Terrace, an anthology of early Chinese love poetry, was included in the second edition of the book from Penguin 1982. He has written poetry in classical Chinese under the name Pu Ling-en (\u84b2\u9f84\u6069). In 2016, a lengthy interview with Prynne about his poetic practice appeared in The Paris Review as part of its \"The Art of Poetry\" series. In 2020, in an unprecedented burst of productivity, Prynne published 13 small press chapbooks. Although some of the books are very brief, they contain overall some 175 poems, including two book-length poems.\nPrynne was educated at St Dunstan's College, Catford, and Jesus College, Cambridge. He is a Life Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He retired in October 2005 from his posts teaching English Literature as a Lecturer and University Reader in English Poetry for the University of Cambridge and as Director of Studies in English for Gonville and Caius College; in September 2006 he retired from his position as Librarian of the College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*J.

To confuse matters, more recently the term late modernism has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930.
