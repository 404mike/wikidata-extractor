Feeney's only full season in charge of the club ended without silverware. The Blues challenged for the league title for most of the season, but ultimately had to settle for the runners-up spot for the second successive season, behind champions Crusaders. One positive for the season was the team's record in the four \"Big Two\" league derbies against Glentoran, of which the Blues won three and drew the other. The lowest point of the season for the team was undoubtedly a shock 1\u20130 loss against second-tier side Ballyclare Comrades in the second round of the 2014\u201315 League Cup, while their 2014\u201315 Irish Cup campaign ended when they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 3\u20132 to eventual runners-up Portadown.", "Former Northern Ireland striker and the country's all-time record international goalscorer David Healy was appointed as Feeney's successor, with Andy Todd staying on as Healy's assistant manager.

This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated V\u00e5lerenga 4\u20131 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966\u201367 European Cup.

Linfield came out 2\u20131 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1\u20131 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1\u20130 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since their debut in 1959.
