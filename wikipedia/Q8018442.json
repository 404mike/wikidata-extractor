Educated at Bedford School and at Balliol College, Oxford, he was a right-hand batsman and slow left-arm orthodox bowler.He played first-class matches for the Minor Counties between 1929 and 1934, and Oxford University in 1931. He then joined Nottinghamshire in 1935 and stayed with them until 1950, captaining the club in his final three years.Sime became a QC in 1957. He was Recorder of Grantham and was appointed a Circuit Judge in 1972.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Nottinghamshire, captained for the first time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.Playfair, pp. 102\u2013103. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches."]}, {"page": "List of convention centers named after people", "response": ["*Sime Darby Convention Centre, Bukit Kiara, Kuala Lumpur, named for William Sime and Henry Darby (founders of Sime Darby"]}, {"page": "Charles Lodge Adamson", "response": ["Adamson made his debut for Durham against the Lancashire Second XI in the 1926 Minor Counties Championship.
