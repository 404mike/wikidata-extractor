This view was accepted among many other Plymouth Brethren movements in England. Darby and other prominent Brethren were part of the Brethren movement which impacted American Christianity, especially with movements and teachings associated with Christian eschatology and fundamentalism, primarily through their writings. Influences included the Bible Conference Movement, starting in 1878 with the Niagara Bible Conference. These conferences, which were initially inclusive of historicist and futurist premillennialism, led to an increasing acceptance of futurist premillennial views and the pre-tribulation rapture especially among Presbyterian, Baptist, and Congregational members. Popular books also contributed to acceptance of the pre-tribulation rapture, including William E.

Manuel Lacunza (1731\u20131801), a Jesuit priest (under the pseudonym Juan Josafat Ben Ezra), wrote an apocalyptic work entitled La venida del Mes\u00edas en gloria y majestad (The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty).

Huebner, and Carol Berubee.", "Dispensationalism developed as a system from the teachings of John Nelson Darby, considered by some to be the father of dispensationalism (1800\u201382), who strongly influenced the Plymouth Brethren of the 1830s in Ireland and England. The original concept came when Darby considered the implications of Isaiah 32 for Israel. He saw that prophecy required a future fulfillment and realization of Israel's kingdom. The New Testament church was seen as a separate program not related to that kingdom. Thus arose a prophetic earthly kingdom program for Israel and a separate \"mystery\" heavenly program for the church. In order to not conflate the two programs, the prophetic program had to be put on hold to allow for the church to come into existence. Then it is necessary for the church to be raptured away before prophecy can resume its earthly program for Israel.Update On Dispensationalism by Charles C. Ryrie in Issues In Dispensationalism edited by Wesley R. Willis and John R. Master, page 17", "John Nelson Darby taught, and most subsequent dispensationalists have maintained, that God considers the Jews as his earthly chosen people, even as they remain in rejection of Jesus Christ, and God continues to maintain an earthly destiny in the future millennial Kingdom when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth and establishes it in fulfillment of prophecy in the prophetic scheme. Dispensationalists teach that a remnant within the nation of Israel will be born again, called of God, and by grace brought to realize that they crucified their Messiah. Dispensationalism is unique in teaching that the Church stands in a dispensation that occurs as a parenthesis in the prophetic Kingdom program, a dispensational \"mystery\" or \"grace\" period, meaning that it was not directly revealed in prophecy in the Old Testament, and that this \"age of grace\" will end with the rapture of the church allowing the prophetic clock for Israel to start up again. Then the Jewish remnant becomes manifest through the Great Tribulation as a result of recognizing Jesus as their promised Messiah during the trials that come upon them in this Tribulation which serves to purify the nation. Darby's teachings envision Judaism as continuing to enjoy God's protection literally to the end of time, and teach that God has a separate earthly and prophetic Kingdom \"program,\" to use J. Dwight Pentecost's term, for Israel and another heavenly (destined) Mystery program for the Church.

His letters written home during the period of his mission were collected and published in 1856."]}, {"page": "Richard Cassels", "response": ["Powerscourt House, Wicklow, was a large country house, originally a 13th-century castle, which was completely rebuilt by Cassels, starting in 1730 and finishing in 1741.  The demesne was approximately .  The three-story house had at least 68 rooms.  The entrance hall was  long and  wide where family heirlooms were displayed.  The main reception rooms were on the first floor rather than more typically on the ground floor.  King George IV was the guest of Richard Wingfield, 5th Viscount Powerscourt in August 1821. Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt inherited the title and the Powerscourt estate, which comprised  of land in Ireland, at the age of 8 in 1844.  When he reached the age of 21 he embarked on an extensive renovation of the house and created new gardens.  Inspiration for the garden design followed visits by Powerscourt to ornamental gardens at the Palace of Versailles, Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, Vienna and Schwetzingen Palace near uHeidelberg.  The garden development took 20 years to complete in 1880.  On a commanding hilltop position, Cassels deviated slightly from his usual sombre style, to give the house something of what John Vanbrugh would have called the 'castle air' \u2013 a severe Palladian facade terminated by two circular domed towers.  The house was destroyed by fire in 1974 when it was owned by the Slazenger family and renovated in 1996.  In the 1830s, the house was the venue for a number of conferences on unfulfilled Bible prophecies, which were attended by men such as John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving.  These conferences were held under the auspices of Theodosia Wingfield Powerscourt, then the widow Lady Powerscourt."]}, {"page": "George M\u00fcller", "response": ["John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton became opposed concerning certain matters of doctrine and a discussion was held in Plymouth on 5 December 1845. A document entitled The Principles of Open Brethren stated: \"Certain tracts issued by Mr. Newton were judged to contain error regarding the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the question arose whether it was sufficient to exclude from the fellowship those who held the erroneous teaching, or whether all who belonged to a gathering where the error was tolerated were to be put outside the pale, even if they themselves had not embraced it. One party, led by Mr Darby, took the latter view. Others, in particular the Bethesda Church, in which Messrs M\u00fcller and Craik ministered, refused to admit any who were convicted of holding the evil doctrine themselves but did not exclude those who came from Mr Newton's meeting. The exclusive party thereupon declined to have any further fellowship with members of the Bethesda Church or others like-minded. The latter soon came to receive the title of 'Open Brethren'.\"Harding, p 123-4 The more exclusive side of the brethren movement became known as the Exclusive Brethren and was led by Darby. Darby called on M\u00fcller in July 1849 to discuss the split, but M\u00fcller had many prior engagements and could only receive Darby for 10 minutes.
