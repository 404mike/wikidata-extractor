He was never one to kowtow; team-mates and observers detected the chip that was reluctant to leave his shoulder. He was in the modern idiom, his own man.

At that meeting, Somerset were ejected from the competition by seventeen votes to one; only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, and even Somerset voted for the expulsion, saying Rose would have his position as captain reviewed. As a result of Somerset's ejection, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals.

Warwickshire then reached 84 for four just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to inclement weather.
