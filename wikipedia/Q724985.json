He spent three seasons in Arsenal's' reserve team, eventually converting to a centre forward, although his progress was restricted in part by National Service. He made his debut against Stoke City on 26 December 1950; initially a bit-part player, he became an established regular in the side in 1951\u201352 and remained there for three seasons. He was in the Arsenal side to reach the FA Cup Final in 1952.\nWith 22 goals (19 of them in the league) he helped Arsenal to a First Division title in 1952\u201353. However, he lost his place in the Arsenal side in 1954\u201355, before returning the following season (1955\u201356), having been converted into a utility man \u2013 playing in defence, midfield or up front. He continued to figure for Arsenal for another three seasons and on 6 October 1956, he scored four goals in a home match against Manchester City, becoming the first player since Jack Lambert to score more than three in a game at Highbury. In all he scored 88 goals in 217 matches for Arsenal. Although he was often tipped for an England place, he never won a cap for his country.\nHolton was sold to Watford in October 1958 for \u00a39,000, a somewhat surprising move, considering Watford were in the newly formed Fourth Division at the time. Holton spent three seasons with the Hornets, mostly at centre forward. He formed a successful partnership with Dennis Uphill, scoring a club record 48 goals in 1959\u201360, which also saw the club promoted to the Third Division. Holton was then controversially sold to Northampton Town in 1961 where he scored a club record 36 goals in 1961\u201362, thus achieving the rare feat of holding the all-time goals in a season record at two different clubs.\nHolton went on to play for Crystal Palace, signing in December 1962 and was part of the Palace side which achieved promotion to the second tier in 1964, with 43 appearances that season scoring 20 goals. He then signed for Watford (for a second time) on 6 May 1965, before moving on to Charlton Athletic (in a deal which saw Stewart Scullion move in the opposite direction) and subsequently Leyton Orient. He finally retired in 1968, due in part to a knee injury, and left the game completely to take up a career in engineering. He died suddenly while on holiday in 1996, at the age of 67.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Watford F.C.", "response": ["thumb|250px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Watford in the English football league.Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in 1950\u201351 meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league. McBain returned in 1956, and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the 1958\u201359 season, and Watford were placed in the Fourth Division. Ron Burgess replaced McBain during that season, and in the following campaign Burgess presided over Watford's first Football League promotion.
