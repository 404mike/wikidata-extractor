That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading \"Call Dr.Horder\", including the doctor's phone number. It is argued Plath turned on the gas at a time when Thomas would have been able to see the note.Kirk (2004) p. 103 However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker, wrote, \"According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office, [Plath] had thrust her head far into the gas oven and had really meant to die.\"Becker (2003) Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that \"No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion.\" Plath had described the quality of her despair as \"owl's talons clenching my heart\". In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: \"I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do.\"", "The posthumous publication of Ariel in 1965 precipitated Plath's rise to fame. The poems in Ariel mark a departure from her earlier work into a more personal arena of poetry. Robert Lowell's poetry may have played a part in this shift as she cited Lowell's 1959 book Life Studies as a significant influence, in an interview just before her death.Wagner-Martin (1988) p. 184 The impact of Ariel was dramatic, with its dark and potentially autobiographical descriptions of mental illness in poems such as \"Tulips\", \"Daddy\" and \"Lady Lazarus\". Plath's work is often held within the genre of confessional poetry and the style of her work compared to other contemporaries, such as Lowell and W. D. Snodgrass. Plath's close friend Al Alvarez, who wrote about her extensively, said of her later work: \"Plath's case is complicated by the fact that, in her mature work, she deliberately used the details of her everyday life as raw material for her art. A casual visitor or unexpected telephone call, a cut, a bruise, a kitchen bowl, a candlestick\u2014everything became usable, charged with meaning, transformed. Her poems are full of references and images that seem impenetrable at this distance, but which could mostly be explained in footnotes by a scholar with full access to the details of her life.\"Alvarez (2007) p. 214 Many of Plath's later poems deal with what one critic calls the \"domestic surreal\" in which Plath takes everyday elements of life and twists the images, giving them an almost nightmarish quality. Plath's poem \"Morning Song\" from Ariel is regarded as one of her finest poems on freedom of expression of an artist."]}, {"page": "Ted Hughes", "response": ["In October 2015, the BBC Two major documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes's life and work.

No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), p. 6 Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon \"belongs to the stone\",Kalb, J., Beckett in Performance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 43 preoccupied with mundane things such as what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. The monotonous, ritualistic means by which Estragon continuously sits upon the stone may be likened to the constant nail filing carried out by Winnie in Happy Days, another of Beckett's plays, both actions representing the slow, deliberate erosion of the characters' lives. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: \"Do you remember the Gospels?\" Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points to the fact that he may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease.See Brown, V., Yesterday's Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett, pp. 35\u201375 for a detailed discussion of this. Al Alvarez writes: \"But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time.\"Alvarez, A. Beckett 2nd Edition (London: Fontana Press, 1992) Estragon's forgetfulness affords the author a certain narrative utility also, allowing for the mundane, empty conversations held between him and Vladimir to continue seamlessly. They have been together for fifty years but when asked by Pozzo they do not reveal their actual ages. Vladimir's life is not without its discomforts too but he is the more resilient of the pair. \"Vladimir's pain is primarily mental anguish, which would thus account for his voluntary exchange of his hat for Lucky's, thus signifying Vladimir's symbolic desire for another person's thoughts.\"Gurnow, M., No Symbol Where None Intended: A Study of Symbolism and Allusion in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot These characterizations, for some, represented the act of thinking or mental state (Vladimir) and physical things or the body (Estragon). This is visually depicted by Vladimir's continuous attention to his hat and Estragon to his boots. While the two characters are temperamentally opposite, with their differing responses to a situation, they are both essential as demonstrated in the way Vladimir's metaphysical musings were balanced by Estragon's physical demands."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Al Alvarez (fl. 1929\u20132019), English poet"]}, {"page": "Texas hold 'em", "response": ["During this time, B & G Publishing Co., Inc. published Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide, Super/System.

At the conclusion of the game, Nick the Greek uttered what has become one of the most famous poker quotes ever: \"Mr. Moss, I have to let you go.\" This game is often cited as the inspiration behind the WSOP.  This game became the foundation for Al Alvarez's book The Biggest Game in Town and is one of the best known stories in poker. Despite being one of the best-known poker stories, a soon to be released book, Showgirl Stories, by Steve Fischer claims the game never took place.Fischer, Steve.  \"The Biggest Game Never Played\" in Poker Pro Magazine\" pages 36-43. December 2009.    According to Fischer, there were no stories or reports of this tournament until six years after Nick's death. Binion never spoke of the game even when providing a detailed history of Las Vegas and avoided answering questions about the game by saying, \"Well, my memory ain't what it used to be.\" While Nick the Greek was often covered by the national media, there are no news reports in any local or national source. Fischer says that nearly every version of the story is virtually identical to the version first told by Moss beginning circa 1971. The story is consistently said to have taken place in 1949 at the Horseshoe Casino, a casino that did not exist for another year and a half. Fischer also points out that during the time that Binion supposedly set up the game, he was fighting off a request from Texas to have him extradited. Because of his past, Binion lost his license to run a gambling establishment in 1948 and did not regain it until April 13, 1950. He was not granted a license to open the Horseshoe Casino until December 5, 1952.
