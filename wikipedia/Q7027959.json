After fielding for 139 overs, witnessing Essex compile 509 (Graham Gooch 101, Paul Grayson 129, Stuart Law 144), Wood opened the batting with Nick Speak and was caught behind for 1 off Ashley Cowan. He made no further appearances in the 1996 season, but scored 48 not out on his return to the side the following year against Northamptonshire at Old Trafford. The following month he recorded his maiden first-class half century against Middlesex at Uxbridge, scoring 67 against a bowling attack which included Angus Fraser, Jacques Kallis, Phil Tufnell and Richard Johnson. In the next match he shared a 158 run partnership with Graham Lloyd (82 and 90 respectively) \u2013 a Lancashire innings where Andrew Flintoff scored his maiden first-class century (117). He kept his place in the side for the remainder of the season and in the subsequent game against Warwickshire at Blackpool led Lancashire to victory, top scoring with 26. Wood faced virtually every ball of a hostile 16 over bowling spell from South African fast bowler Allan Donald, setting up Lancashire's successful run chase of 91 with only three wickets intact. In the penultimate match of the 1997 County Championship versus Surrey at The Oval, Wood top scored hitting 155, sharing a record opening partnership against Surrey of 259 with Mike Atherton (149). Wood was the top scorer against Surrey in the 1998 County Championship match at Old Trafford guiding Lancashire to victory with 80 not out in the 2nd innings, during which Andrew Flintoff smashed 34 in one over off Alex Tudor. Lancashire then travelled to Edgbaston and Wood again top scored with 79 in Lancashire's successful run chase against Warwickshire. He was then dropped from the team, only returning as cover for Mike Atherton when he was on international duty. He recorded one further first-class half century (82 v Leicestershire at Grace Road), against a strong international seam attack consisting of Michael Kasprowicz, Alan Mullally and Chris Lewis."]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Nick Speak (1997\u20132001) : N.
