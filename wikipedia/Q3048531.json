He first studied medicine and surgery, and it was his elder brother, James Glover (1882\u20131926) who attracted him towards psychoanalysis. Both brothers were analysed in Berlin by Karl Abraham; indeed, the \"list of Karl Abraham's analysands reads like a roster of psychoanalytic eminence: the leading English analysts Edward and James Glover\" at the top. He then settled down in London where he became an influential member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society in 1921. He was also close to Ernest Jones.\nAmongst Edward Glover's most lasting achievements in the combined field of psychotherapy and criminology \u2013 aside from his clinical work and extensive publications \u2013 are his roles as: co-founder of the Psychopathic Clinic (renamed the Portman Clinic in 1937) and the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency, joint founder of The British Journal of Criminology \u2013 he was co-editor until his death \u2013 and co-founder of the British Society of Criminology.
