He primarily plays in the second-row.\nPercival started out at Worcester Warriors, gaining International recognition as a member of Welsh Schools Under 18's and the England Under 21 team that won the 2004 Six Nations Grand Slam.\nHe joined Northampton Saints in the summer of 2005, however his progress was hampered after suffering a broken neck in a friendly game against Munster. This injury ruled him out of action for the whole of the 2005\u201306 season.\nPercival spent much of the 2006\u201307 campaign with a successful on-loan spell at Bedford Blues to get post injury game time.\nPercival left Northampton Saints to join Harlequins in the summer of 2007 and participated in successful Guinness Premiership and Heineken Cup campaigns.\nAt the end of the 2010/2011 Aviva Premiership campaign, Percival left Harlequins and signed a 2-year contract which saw him return to the newly promoted Worcester Warriors, and the club where he started his career. Percival will stay with the Warriors until at least the end of the 2012/2013 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FC Grenoble", "response": ["*  James Percival"]}, {"page": "Percival (disambiguation)", "response": ["*James Percival (assemblyman), member of the New York State Legislature in 1831", "*James Percival (rugby union) (b. 1983), English rugby player "]}, {"page": "James Percival", "response": ["James Percival may refer to:", "*James Percival (rugby union) (born 1983), English rugby player", "*James Percival (assemblyman), member of the New York State Assembly 1831"]}, {"page": "James Percival (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Percival (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "RFU Championship XV", "response": ["| James Percival (c)"]}, {"page": "List of Top 14 foreign players", "response": ["| James Percival ||  || FC Grenoble"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 RFU Championship", "response": ["|LL ||4 || James Percival || ", "|LL ||4 || James Percival"]}, {"page": "List of 2015\u201316 Premiership Rugby transfers", "response": ["* James Percival to  Grenoble"]}, {"page": "List of 2015\u201316 Top 14 transfers", "response": ["*  James Percival from  Worcester Warriors"]}]}}
