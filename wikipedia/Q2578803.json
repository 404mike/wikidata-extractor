He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in The Classical Tradition, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\"."]}, {"page": "Arthur Schopenhauer", "response": ["\"Schopenhauer is often said to be the first modern Western philosopher to attempt integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is true, but the claim that he was influenced by Indian thought needs qualification.

These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas.

It has been suggested that Popper's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism, the followers of which mistook his aims for their own.Bryan Magee 1973: Popper (Modern Masters series)"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Bryan Magee"]}, {"page": "Richard Wagner", "response": ["The poets Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Paul Verlaine worshipped Wagner. \u00c9douard Dujardin, whose influential novel Les Lauriers sont coup\u00e9s is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by Wagnerian music, founded a journal dedicated to Wagner, La Revue Wagn\u00e9rienne, to which J.

Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion in the face of sexual temptation (act II, scene 3). Schopenhauerian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid (\"compassion\") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen (\"yearning\"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act III of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.Dokumente zur Entstehung und ersten Auff\u00fchrung des B\u00fchnenweihfestspiels Parsifal by Richard Wagner, Martin Geck, Egon Voss.

Wagner's attitude to the Jews in general was highly equivocal. His later writings, published when he was a well-known and influential figure, frequently contain aggressive anti-Jewish comments, although at the same time he maintained a circle of Jewish-born colleagues and admirers.Gutman (1990), pp. 412-413"]}, {"page": "The Logic of Scientific Discovery", "response": ["The psychologist Harry Guntrip wrote that its publication \"greatly stimulated the discussion of the nature of scientific knowledge\", including by philosophers who did not completely agree with Popper, such as Thomas Kuhn and Horace Romano Harr\u00e9.

The philosopher Paul Ric\u0153ur endorsed \"procedures of invalidation\" similar to Popper's criteria for falsifiability. The historian Peter Gay described the work as \"an important treatise in epistemology\". The philosopher Bryan Magee considered Popper's criticisms of logical positivism \"devastating\". In his view, Popper's most important argument against logical positivism is that, while it claimed to be a scientific theory of the world, its central tenet, the verification principle, effectively destroyed all of science.Magee, Bryan. Confessions of a Philosopher. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1997, p. 46. The physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont argued that critiques of Popper's work have provoked an \"irrationalist drift\", and that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science \"can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies\" in The Logic of Scientific Discovery.Sokal, Alan. Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture. Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 182-183.
