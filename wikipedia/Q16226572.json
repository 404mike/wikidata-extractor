Ineson is particularly noted for his work with stable isotopes (and was the first to grow C3 plants on C4 soil).\nIneson received his BSc from Manchester Polytechnic in 1982, receiving a Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool in 1986.  He was then a NERC Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at the University of Exeter until 1989.  NERC Research Fellow at ITE Merlewood and later Senior Scientific Officer (SSO).  Between 1996 and 1999 he was at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, (CEH) Merlewood.  Between 1998 and 2000 he was Visiting Professor at Lancaster University.  He was made Chair in Global Change Ecology at York in 2000.\nIneson et al. (1996) were able to track the movement of carbon through a plant by using the stable isotopes of carbon, namely 12C and 13C.  To obtain soil with a different isotope ratio to normal, they obtained soil from North America on which C4 plants had been grown, giving it a different signature to soil on which C3 plants had been grown.  Comparisons of the signatures allowed the turnover of carbon to be measured.  This is now a commonly used technique (see e.g. Pataki et al. (2003)) particularly useful in light of elevated carbon dioxide levels due to atmospheric pollution.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Metropolitan University", "response": ["* Phil Ineson \u2013 academic"]}, {"page": "Marsh Ecology Award", "response": ["*2006 Phil Ineson"]}, {"page": "Ineson", "response": ["*Phil Ineson, British academic"]}, {"page": "M. Francesca Cotrufo", "response": ["Cotrufo was born in Naples, Italy. In high school she was passionate about science and ancient Greek. Cotrufo decided to further her studies in Biology, rather than ancient languages, because of the possibility to make novel discoveries that were relevant to the world's problems. Cotrufo earned her B.S. in Biology from the University of Naples, Italy in 1991. While there, she became interested in the environment and litter decomposition. Cotrufo wrote her undergraduate honor thesis, \"Effects of urban heavy metal pollution on organic matter decomposition in Quercus ilex woods,\" in the lab of the only professor of ecology at her university. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in Soil Ecology from Lancaster University, UK in 1995, where she worked with Phil Ineson as her advisor and studied soil organic matter and its formation from the decomposition of plant inputs."]}]}}
