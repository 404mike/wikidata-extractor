Simms remained out of Parliament until 28 February 1884, when he was a candidate at the first election for the Central district of the Legislative Council, his opponent being Philip Santo. Previously the Council had been chosen by the whole colony voting in one electorate, but by the Constitution Act of 1881 its strength was increased from 18 to 24 members, and it was divided into four electoral districts. The first vacancy under the new system was caused by the death of Sir William Morgan, and Simms won in a close and hard-fought contest. He resigned from the Council on 14 April 1891. During his long period in politics he never sought a Cabinet position or personal gain, never engaged in party politics, and retained a high popularity with fellow members and electors alike."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1881\u20131884", "response": ["|| Hugh Fraser || West Adelaide || 1868\u20131870, 1871\u20131876, 1878\u20131884"]}, {"page": "Allan Campbell (Australian politician)", "response": ["He was one of a long line of notables to hold this position:Alexander Hay 1881\u20131883; J.
