However, for the trip to play Accrington on 29 December 1888 Farmer was either injured or, unavailable. This led to Harry Parkinson' debut at left-half against Accrington at the latter' Thorneyholme Road ground. Everton won the toss and elected to let Accrington kick-off into the low December sun. It seemed to pay off as Everton' William Brown scored to put Everton 1-0 ahead. Both teams had opportunities with both goalkeepers, Johnny Horne and Charles Jolliffe called into action but Accrington got a free-kick and scored to make it 1\u20131 at half-time. Accrington dominated the second-half, scored twice and were comfortable winners 3\u20131. That was Parkinson' only appearance for Everton."]}, {"page": "Jolliffe, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Jolliffe"]}]}}
