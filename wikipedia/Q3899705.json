He then joined Reading before moving to Spurs in March 1908. His first goal for the club came on his debut against Millwall. Spurs was elected to the Football League Second Division in 1908. In Spurs' first year in the Football League, Minter scored 16 goals for the club, which finished runner-up in the Second Division that season and was promoted to the First Division. Spurs however struggled in their first year in the top flight, but narrowly avoided relegation when they beat Chelsea in the last game of the season with goals from Minter and a former Chelsea player Percy Humphreys, sending Chelsea down instead. Minter become top-scorer for a few seasons and helped the club retain top flight status for a number of years. He remained as a player for Spurs until 1920, making 334 appearances and scoring 101 goals the club in all competitions. He was the top scorer for the club until the record was broken by Jimmy Dimmock in 1930."]}]}}
