He has served on the United Nations International Commission on Building Stones and is a distinguished international consultant on stone as a building material.Shadmon\u2019s expertise in mining and quarrying is credited with singlehandedly fostering those industries in Israel.

Translated as \"kingly stone\", (or \"queenly\"), \"royal stone\", or \"stone of kings\", the source of the word's meaning may derive from Jerusalem Stone's use in all the monumental tombs of Jerusalem.BAS Archive Israeli building stone authority Asher Shadmon cites the word as one of the local or colloquial \"mason's terms\" that have been \"adopted by geologists\" and are applied in the technical literature.Shadmon, Op. cit., pg 21.

Other geologists at the congress suggested that the commission should cover also the relationship between the materials in their natural place and the work of engineers.", "However, on 21 December the delegates decided to immediately hold a new session during which the International Association for Engineering Geology (IAEG) was unanimously created.
