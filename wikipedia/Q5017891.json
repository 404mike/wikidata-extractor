As White says, \u2018Swimming across the Thames Estuary two ways is difficult as one has to contemplate the tides. The outgoing tide is difficult to swim against and one had to swim fast enough to time getting there and back on the one tide otherwise there is a danger of being stranded on the return. My swim found me walking across the mud flats approx. 100 yards from the Leigh tow path, which runs along the shoreline.\u2019  At the time this swim was recognized by the BLDSA, when the organization was in its infancy.
