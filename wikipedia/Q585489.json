They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V).\"Canticle I\" , \"Canticle II\" , \"Canticle III\" , \"Canticle IV\" , and \"Canticle V\" , Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 30 June 2013 The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th-century poem \"A Divine Rapture\", and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns. Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which \"ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music\". The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac.  \"Canticle III\" from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem \"Still Falls the Rain\", composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique. Canticle IV: The Journey of the Magi, premiered in 1971, is based on T. S. Eliot's poem \"Journey of the Magi\". It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a \"companion piece\" to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem \"Death of Saint Narcissus\". Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text \"almost frighteningly apt\u00a0... for a composer conscious of his own sickness\". Matthews sees Narcissus as \"another figure from [Britten's] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty\"."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Francis Quarles (1592\u20131644), English Christian poet"]}, {"page": "The Raven", "response": ["Poe first brought \"The Raven\" to his friend and former employer George Rex Graham of Graham's Magazine in Philadelphia.
