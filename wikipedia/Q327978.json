With his excellent ball control and distribution, which enables him to start plays from the back, he has said he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if he wanted to. Hugo Lloris of Tottenham Hotspur and France and former goalkeepers Fabien Barthez and Edwin van der Sar, have also been described as sweeper-keepers, while Claudio Bravo and Ederson Moraes have even been described as playmakers in the media."]}, {"page": "Thomas Lawrence (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tommy Lawrence (1940\u20132018), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Bert Slater", "response": ["Things got worse for Slater, Tommy Lawrence, signed in 1957 as a 17-year-old, was beginning to mature and was starting knock on the first team door, Slater was now considered to be lower than the under-12 goalkeeper in the pecking order, according to Bill Shankly, and thus was deemed surplus to requirements.
