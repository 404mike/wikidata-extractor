The song received a positive response from her fans, prompting Lane to record the track. To bring further attention to it, Lane and Stoller planned to release it as a single. However, United Artists was hesitant about the idea. The promotion department argued that the song was too religious for country music radio stations. Promotion director, Jerry Siebolt, also argued that the song had previously been recorded and had not \"made an impression on the public\". Composed by Marijohn Wilkin and Kris Kristofferson, \"One Day at a Time\" had first been a hit for Marilyn Sellars and again for Lena Martell. Lane eventually received approval from label record-head Don Grierson to release the track. At first, \"One Day at a Time\" received a mixed response from country disc jockeys. However, Lee Stoller used his position as manager to promote the song by calling radio stations continuously. In 1980, the song went to number one on the Billboard country singles chart. It was Lane's first and only single to reach the number one spot. The track also reached the top ten of the RPM Country Songs survey. It was included on her corresponding album titled Ask Me to Dance (1980). The disc was Lane's highest-charting Billboard country album, climbing to number 14. It also spent 34 weeks on the Cashbox country LP's chart. The album also spawned Lane's follow-up single release, \"Sweet Sexy Eyes\".
