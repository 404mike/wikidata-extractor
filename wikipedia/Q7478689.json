He played two Test matches for England in 1935 against South Africa. An opening batsman with an excellent batting technique, Barber often batted in the middle order. He scored 16,402 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.28 with 29 centuries. Barber made his debut in 1926 and made several appearances over the next few seasons. Despite a sound defence, Barber did not secure a regular first team place until 1932.  He scored a thousand runs for the first time that season, a feat he was to achieve eight times, while he scored over 2,000 runs in 1935. Until the Second World War broke out, Barber continued as a regular member of the Yorkshire side. After the war, he played one more full season before retiring in 1947. His career continued in club cricket and he went on to coach local sides before his death in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["Note: If the qualification is removed, the best career average record is at 0.00 runs per wicket (i.e. no runs were conceded).

In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year.

Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind Lancashire and Gloucestershire.Webber, p.67.  Alan Barber replaced William Worsley as Yorkshire's amateur captain but played for one season only.  Of greater significance was the retirement of the man who many saw as the true Yorkshire captain, Wilfred Rhodes.  But one legend was replaced by another as Hedley Verity immediately stepped into Rhodes' boots, making 10 championship appearances and taking 52 wickets.  Sutcliffe made only 13 appearances in the championship as a result of Test calls and his thumb injury.  The team in 1930 lacked balance with a lot of changes taking place but a typical line-up was Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Mitchell, Robinson, Wood, Rhodes or Verity, Alan Barber, Macaulay and Bowes.  The likes of Wilf Barber, Frank Dennis and future captain Frank Greenwood made occasional appearances.", "It was a great season for Yorkshire also as they finally won the County Championship for the first time since 1925.Webber, p.68.

Wilf Barber was the main reserve and an interesting debutant was Arthur Booth, 15 seasons before he was finally able to make his mark as another match-winning bowler.", "Largely on account of Sutcliffe's runs and the bowling of Bowes and Verity, Yorkshire were able to win 15 of their last 16 games and retain their County Championship title.Webber, p.69.  Although Frank Greenwood was still the club captain, he only played in 6 championship matches and it was newcomer Brian Sellers who led Yorkshire in most of their matches.  Sellers soon became one of Yorkshire's greatest captains.  Percy Holmes missed several matches and Sutcliffe sometimes opened with Wilf Barber who now became a first team regular, especially as Edgar Oldroyd had retired.
