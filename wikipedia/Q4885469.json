He was awarded a four-year contract by Worcestershire later that year.Cox did not establish himself as Worcestershire's first choice wicket-keeper until 2014 when he was 22 years of age. In that season he scored his first first-class century (against Essex) and was described by former-England wicket-keeper James Foster as  \"...one of the best young keepers I have ever seen.\"In 2018 Vitality Blast Finals day, Cox played a key part in Worcestershire winning their first Vitality T20 Blast trophy. In the Semi-Final, against Lancashire he scored 55* and in the final, against Sussex made 46*, scoring the winning runs.

On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast game between the Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. Their keeper, Ben Cox, became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled.
