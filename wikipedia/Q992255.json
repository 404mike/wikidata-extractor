After a goalless first half the introduction of Craig Beattie at half time made Hearts more of an attacking threat. After just 70 seconds he set up Rudi Skacel to score the match's opener. Gary Hooper equalised on the 87th minute, television replays later showed that Hooper was half-a-yard offside. With the match in injury time, referee Euan Norris awarded Hearts a penalty for a handball in the Celtic box by Joe Ledley. Beattie stepped up to score the Penalty, before getting booked for taking his shirt off and his impromptu lap of honour in his celebration of the goal. Celtic had an appeal for handball turned down in the dying minutes of the game and Hearts progressed to the final."]}]}}
