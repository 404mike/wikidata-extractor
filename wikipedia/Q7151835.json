With no money or accommodation, Barrie allowed Anderson and Warriors keyboardist and vocals Brian Chatton to stay with him. Anderson helped out by working at La Chasse; during this time he got talking to Paul Korda, a producer for EMI Records who took him on to sing several demos. During the search for material to record, Barrie got in touch with Elton John and Bernie Taupin of DJM Records to put some music together, but felt Anderson did not like much of it. Meanwhile, Anderson travelled to the Netherlands to join Les Crunches, a band he met in London, but promptly returned when he found out some of his demos were to be released as singles by Parlophone Records. Released under his pseudonym Hans Christian, the first, an orchestrated cover of \"Never My Love\" by the Association with \"All of the Time\" on its B-side, received a positive reception from New Musical Express and Chris Welch for Melody Maker who wrote in March 1968, \"A blockbuster of a hit from a young fairy tale teller with an emotion packed voice.\" Anderson's second single, \"(The Autobiography of) Mississippi Hobo\"/\"Sonata of Love\", was released two months later; neither song was successful. Barrie and Korda then took Anderson to see local group the Gun and together rehearsed for well received gigs at the UFO and Marquee clubs in London, the latter as an opener for the Who, which led to several gig offers. However, the rest of the group believed they could reach success without a lead vocalist and sacked Anderson."]}, {"page": "Immediate Records", "response": ["Immediate Records was started in 1965.
