Her childhood home was 17, Percy Avenue, in Whitley Bay, Northumberland, in what is now Tyne and Wear.\nTaylor first became known when she won a beauty pageant at a young age and this led to parts in musical comedies on stage, including The Cabaret Girl (1922), in which she was billed as simply \"Enid Taylor\". She progressed to film, appearing in Alfred Hitchcock's Easy Virtue (1928), Queen of Hearts (1934), and The Wicked Lady (1945).The Stamp part of her name was included as a middle name; it was her  grandmother's maiden name. Taylor married Sidney Colton and they had a daughter called Robin Anne who was born in 1933. Her marriage to Colton was dissolved in 1936. On 9 January 1946 she fell in the bathroom of her Park Lane flat and suffered a fractured skull. She was unconscious for three days; she woke briefly following two operations at St George's Hospital in Wimbledon to remove a blood clot to her brain, but died on the 13 January, two months after the release of her penultimate film, The Wicked Lady.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A.
