String figures, once thought to have proven monogenesis, appear to have arisen independently as an entertainment pastime in many societies. Many figures were collected and described from south-east Asia, Japan, South America, West Indies, Pacific Islanders, Inuit and other Native Americans.Gryski, Camilla (1983). Cat's Cradle, Owl's Eyes: A Book of String Games, p.4. . Figures have also been collected in Europe and Africa.

These non-Irish coracles all ultimately trace their origin to the quffa, a round Iraqi riverboat dating to the 9th century BCE, or possibly even as early as the 2nd millennium BCE. The resemblances between the currach and the coracle and quffa are a coincidence, however. British ethnologist James Hornell, who studied the currach, coracle, and quffa extensively during the early 20th century, believes that the currach was developed independently of the coracle and quffa in a case of multiple invention.Hornell (1939), pp. 13"]}, {"page": "Edward Atkinson Hornel", "response": ["Edward Atkinson Hornel (17 July 1864 \u2013 1933) was a Scottish painter of landscapes, flowers, and foliage, with children.

The Vikings portrayed fierce heads with open jaws and bulging eyes at bow and stern of their longships to ward off evil spirits, and the figureheads on the prows of sailing ships were regarded with affection by mariners and represented the belief that the vessel needed to find its way. The Egyptians placed figures of holy birds on the prow while the Phoenicians used horses representing speed. The Ancient Greeks used boars' heads to symbolise acute vision and ferocity while Roman boats often mounted a carving of a centurion representing valour in battle. In northern Europe, serpents, bulls, dolphins and dragons were customary used to decorate ships' prows and by the thirteenth century, the swan was commonly used to signify grace and mobility."]}, {"page": "Kuphar", "response": ["There were two major forms of construction used \u2014 hides stretched over a framework, as described by Herodotus, and woven bundles of reeds or basketry, waterproofed with bitumen.
