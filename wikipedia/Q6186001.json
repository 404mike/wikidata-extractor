It is still one of the top 50 best-selling singles in the UK.  Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock.\"", "After filling in on a bill headlined by singer Dusty Springfield, they met her brother, songwriter and producer Tom Springfield, who had experience with writing folk-pop material and lyrics/tunes with the siblings' earlier group The Springfields.

The melody is based on a Russian folk song, while the lyrics were written by Tom Springfield; it reached #1 on both the Australian and the U.K. charts, and at its peak, the single was selling 93,000 copies a day in Great Britain alone.  However, although \"The Carnival Is Over\" became a signature song for the group, it was a flop in North America, peaking at #105 in the US and missing the Canadian charts completely.", "In December 1966 they issued \"Georgy Girl\", which became their highest charting American hit when it reached #2 on the Billboard Hot\u00a0100 and #1 on the Cashbox Top\u00a0100 in February 1967. It was the title song and theme for the British film of the same name starring Lynn Redgrave and James Mason and sold 3.5\u00a0million copies worldwide. The band was awarded a gold record certificate by the Recording Industry Association of America. Meanwhile, it was #3 in the U.K., and #1 in Australia.
