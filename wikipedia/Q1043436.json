In 1989, Alan Clarke directed The Firm, starring real-life Millwall supporter Gary Oldman. He plays Bex, leader of the football firm the Inter City Crew, a fictional representation of West Ham's Inter City Firm and their violent exploits. In it, Millwall's Bushwackers firm are depicted as The Buccaneers. Green Street was released in 2004, with real-life Hammers supporter Elijah Wood playing an American student who gets involved with West Ham's firm. The film builds up to the big clash with Millwall's firm at the climax, after the two teams draw each other in the Cup, foreshadowing the reality of the League Cup game which led to the 2009 Upton Park riot. It was a moderate financial success, grossing just over $3 million worldwide. The rise of a football hooligan, Carlton Leach, is chronicled in 2007's Rise of the Footsoldier, from his beginnings on the terraces to becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals. The bitter rivalry between the Hammers and the Lions is displayed, by the use of original footage, during the opening scenes of the film. In 2009, a direct-to-video sequel to Green Street was made, Green Street 2: Stand Your Ground. It follows on directly from the original's climax, with several members of West Ham's and Millwall's firms ending up in prison together and arranging a football match.\"r A remake of The Firm, also titled The Firm was released in 2009 by Nick Love, director of The Football Factory and himself a Millwall supporter. Set in the 1980s, the film highlights the music, fashion and culture surrounding football at the time. It was generally well received by critics. In October 2009, the Metropolitan Police released still photos from the film in relation to a search for hooligans from the Upton Park riot. The mistake led to an apology from Scotland Yard. The 2012 zombie comedy Cockneys vs Zombies referenced the rivalry, showing Millwall and West Ham zombies fighting amongst themselves in East London after a zombie apocalypse. In 2013 a third film in the Green Street franchise, Green Street 3: Never Back Down was released. It focuses on a rivalry between West Ham and Millwall fans within mixed martial arts."]}, {"page": "Ricci Harnett", "response": ["Ricci Harnett (born 20 March 1975) is an English actor, best known for his role as Carlton Leach In the film Rise of the Footsoldier.", "*Rise of the Footsoldier (2007) as Carlton Leach", "*Rise of the Footsoldier:Part 2 (2015) as Carlton Leach"]}, {"page": "Strength Thru Oi!", "response": ["When Strength Thru Oi! was released, it was controversial because its title was alleged to be a play on a Nazi slogan (\"Strength Through Joy\"), and the cover featured Nicky Crane, a British Movement activist who was serving a four-year sentence for racist violence. Rock critic Garry Bushell, who was responsible for compiling the album, said its title was a pun on The Skids' EP Strength Through Joy and that, as an active anti-fascist in the 1970s, he had been unaware of the Nazi connotations. He also denied knowing the identity of the skinhead on the album's cover until it was exposed by the Daily Mail two months later. The intended cover model was bodybuilder Carlton Leach but the pictures, taken at the Bridge House pub in Canning Town, East London, weren't good enough. A cover drawn up by the record label showing a young skinhead from above with the title on his head was rejected.
