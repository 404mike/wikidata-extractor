Influential film critic Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Secrets & Lies four out of four stars. He wrote that \"moment after moment, scene after scene, Secrets & Lies unfolds with the fascination of eavesdropping\". He called the film \"a flowering of his technique. It moves us on a human level, it keeps us guessing during scenes as unpredictable as life, and it shows us how ordinary people have a chance of somehow coping with their problems, which are rather ordinary, too.\" In 2009, he added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list. The film received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and Best Director."]}]}}
