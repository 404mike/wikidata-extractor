Joe Wright selected Knightley for her tomboyish nature combined with a \"lively mind\" and sense of humour.  Knightley, who had admired the book from a young age,Biography Today, p. 90 said of her character, \"The beauty of Elizabeth is that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself, with all her faults and imperfections.\" On release, the film became a huge commercial success, with total collections of around US$120million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw labeled her performance of \"beauty, delicacy, spirit and wit; in her growing lustre and confidence\" and Derek Elley of Variety regarded \"luminous strength\" to be reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn. Knightley earned \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards for her performance at age 20, becoming the third-youngest nominee for the latter. Knightley's consecutive successes came with increased media scrutiny, and she later admitted to having struggled with her mental health during this period. ", "Knightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases, Fran\u00e7ois Girard's Silk, and Joe Wright's Atonement, the feature film adaptations of the novels by Alessandro Baricco and Ian McEwan respectively. The former project failed at the box office, while the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley portrayed Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters, who struggles with a wartime romance with her love interest, played by James McAvoy. She admitted that the pacing on the smaller, more intimate film was an adjustment compared to the Pirates franchise. In preparing for the film, Knightley studied the novel as well as the \"naturalism\" of the performance as seen in the films from 1930s and 1940s, such as In Which We Serve (1942) and Brief Encounter (1945). She admired the multi-layered and \"fascinating\" nature of her character's behavior. Knightley's performance won the Empire Award for Best Actress, and earned her nominations for the BAFTA and the Golden Globes awards, also in the leading actress categories. Critic Richard Roeper, who thought the lead duo were \"superb\" in their respective roles, was puzzled by their failure to receive Academy Award nominations. The green dress worn by Knightley during the film's climactic scene garnered substantive press attention, and was subsequently regarded as one of the greatest costumes in film history.", "Knightley then starred as the 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire in Saul Dibb's period drama The Duchess (2008), based on the best-selling biographical novel, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman.- -  The film tells the story of Georgiana's rise in society as a sociopolitical tastemaker after her marriage disintegrates. The script Knightley was sent was covered in \"huge white ostrich feathers\" and a gold ribbon. Gabrielle Tana, the film's producer, stated Knightley \"brought an instinctive understanding\" of such aspects of Georgiana's life as a celebrity from her own experiences. Knightley was attracted to her character's strength and status as a political influence and fashion prowess, while being inwardly vulnerable and isolated. Simon Crooke of Empire described her performance as an \"an enigmatic, free-spirited turn and a role she'll be remembered for, probably her best role to date in a film not directed by Joe Wright.\" The following year, she was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress. A film adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy King Lear set to star Knightley and Anthony Hopkins was cancelled due to recession.", "Knightley co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2012 comedy drama Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, which was critically panned.\" Later that year, she reunited with director Joe Wright to film their third production, Anna Karenina, in which she starred as the title character. She deemed this collaboration the most important of her career. Knightley viewed that her character's complex \"moral culpability\" was in question, but attracted compassion. Knightley received positive reviews for her performance, prompting early Oscar buzz. Batsy Sharky of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Knightley \"puts hearts and anguish on the line in trying to bring an emotional reality\". The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival saw the premiere of Knightley's first musical film Begin Again with Mark Ruffalo. Directed by John Carney, the film had its theatrical release in 2014. The Guardian found Knightley and Ruffalo to be \"nicely natural as the increasingly idealistic musos\". Carney later repeatedly criticised Knightley's performance in the film, saying she was not convincing enough in portraying a singer-songwriter and derogatorily referred to her as a \"model\". He later apologised to her via Twitter for his comments. Knightley later remarked that music \"never sinks in\" for her, and she is more interested in books and drama.
