With white settlement these new territories were initially organized as part of existing counties in eastern and central Pennsylvania.  White settlers were few in the eighteenth century and encountering Indians still very much a part of daily life.  Any degree of stability and safety came only after the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794).  Indiana County was carved out of Westmoreland and Lycoming counties in 1803 and divided into three townships: Wheatfield, Armstrong, and Mahoning.  The confluence of Two Lick and Yellow creeks (present-day Homer City) was a contender for the seat of government for the new county, but instead the \"extraordinary overtures\" of George Clymer, a local landowners and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, saw the county seat situated instead in what would become the Borough of Indiana.  Center Township - the unincorporated area surrounding present-day Homer City - was created from a portion of Armstrong Township in 1807, its landscape dotted with larger and smaller family homesteads (farms) and an increasing number of mills and trading posts."]}, {"page": "Whiskey Rebellion", "response": ["Hamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government.

His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration.Slaughter, 125\u201327. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language.

Though Morris ultimately declined to attend the convention, the delegates convinced Congress to authorize a convention in Philadelphia in May 1787 to amend the Articles. The Pennsylvania state legislature sent a delegation consisting of Morris, James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris, George Clymer, Thomas Mifflin, Jared Ingersoll, and Ben Franklin to the Philadelphia Convention. With the exception of Franklin (who avoided aligning with either political faction in Pennsylvania), all of the Pennsylvania delegates were closely aligned with Morris's Republican faction, a reflection of Republican strength in the state legislature. Many of Morris's Nationalist allies from other states, including Hamilton, James Madison, John Dickinson, and Washington, would also attend the convention.Rappleye (2010), pp. 428\u2013433", "In 1797 Morris conveyed his household furniture to Thomas Fitzsimmons which was sold at public auction.

Unable to dodge his creditors and their lawyers, Morris was finally arrested. He was imprisoned for debt in Prune Street prison in Philadelphia from February 1798 to August 1801.Axelrod, Alan.
