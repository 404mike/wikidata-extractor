During the war, since many players were in the armed forces, those who remained with their clubs would often make guest appearances for other clubs to make up the numbers. As well as playing for Wigan, Ball made guest appearances for Gravesend.\nIn February 1948, Ball was signed by Manchester United for a fee of \u00a32,000. He made his debut two months later, a 2\u20130 defeat away to Everton on 10 April 1948. In just over two years with United, Ball was never a regular starter in the first team, serving as understudy to Johnny Carey at right back, and he made just 23 appearances in total for the club before being sold to Bolton Wanderers in September 1950.\nBall flourished at Bolton, playing in 200 league games for the Trotters. His Bolton career spanned eight seasons, from 1950 until his retirement from playing in 1958. He played in the 'Matthews Final' in 1953. In 1960, Ball was appointed as manager of his first club, Wigan Athletic. He remained in the position for three years, before retiring from football altogether and set up a painting and decorating business. Later he emigrated to live in Australia, where he died in July 1998 at the age of 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Ball", "response": ["Jack, Johnny or John Ball may refer to:", "*John Ball (priest) ( 1338 \u2013 1381), English radical priest and leader of 1381 Peasants' Revolt", "*John Ball (minister) (1665\u20131745), English Presbyterian minister", "*John Ball (clergyman) (before 1760 \u2013 after 1795), African-American minister from Nova Scotia", "*John Ball (bishop) (1934\u20132016), British Anglican bishop", "*John Ball (musician) (born 1990), American Christian musician", "*John Ball (16th-century MP) (1518\u20131556), English Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich", "*John Ball (assemblyman) (1756\u20131838), American soldier and politician", "*John Ball (naturalist) (1818\u20131889), Irish naturalist and politician, MP for County Carlow 1857\u20131880", "*John Ball (pioneer) (1794\u20131884), American pioneer and state politician", "*John Ball (Drogheda MP), MP for Drogheda in the Irish House of Commons", "*John Ball (golfer) (1861\u20131940), English amateur golfer; winner of The Open Championship ", "*John Ball (footballer, born 1925) (1925\u20131998), English footballer for Bolton Wanderers", "*John Ball (soccer, born 1972), American footballer for Rochester Rhinos", "*John Ball (Puritan) (1585\u20131640), English author and scholar", "*John Ball (pioneer) (1794\u20131884), American explorer", "*John Ball (geologist) (1872\u20131941), English geologist ", "*John Ball (novelist) (1911\u20131988), American novelist", "*Sir John Ball (born 1948), English mathematician ", "*John Ball (cognitive scientist) (born 1963), American cognitive scientist", "*John Ball Primary School, primary school in Blackheath, London"]}, {"page": "Johnny Ball", "response": ["Ball began his entertainment career by working as a Butlin's Redcoat, and was an entertainer in northern clubs and cabaret.
