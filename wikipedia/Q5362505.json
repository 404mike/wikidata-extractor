It found him work with John Gould, Stanley and other leading contemporary naturalists, and the young Queen Victoria engaged him to help her with her painting technique. Parrots was a forerunner to the major volumes of bird paintings by Gould, and Lear's work has influenced children's illustrators such as Beatrix Potter and Maurice Sendak as well as bird specialists like William Y. Cooper, Elizabeth Butterworth and Walton Ford.", "Lear's influence on illustrators of children's books, such as Beatrix Potter and Maurice Sendak was more through his nonsense books than his bird paintings,Peck (2021) pp.148\u2013151. but other illustrators made more conscious use of his avian works. William Y. Cooper and Elizabeth Butterworth both painted birds from life, and made deliberate efforts to incorporate elements of Lear's style; Butterworth has illustrated four books on parrots, including Amazon Parrots: A Monograph, written by Rosemary Low.Peck (2021) pp. 156\u2013161."]}, {"page": "Butterworth (surname)", "response": ["*Elizabeth Butterworth (born 1949), English artist"]}, {"page": "Butterworth, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Butterworth"]}]}}
