This movement is entailed with many projects under the work of feminism activists through social media in the United States ever since 2012. One of the significant contributions was a live document on Twitter initiated by a UK-based activist, Laura Bates that recorded the everyday experiences of sexism under the project called Everyday Sexism Project. She received over 25,000 responses from 15 countries that included reports on sexist jokes, workplace sexism, sexual assault and victim-blaming. This was due to the sense of injustice ascribed to the victims and those who wanted to work on gender inequality. The project was one of the efforts to bridge the gap between genders through heightening the awareness regarding the oppression caused which is one of the primary purposes of the feminism movement.", " In 2012, Laura Bates established a website and set up a social media channel worldwide where victims can submit individual occurrences of sexism they had experienced, with her Everyday Sexism Project. The project received thousands of entries from all over the world, mainly the States, \"A schoolgirl and a widow reported being pressured and pestered for sex. A reverend in the Church of England was repeatedly asked if there was a man available to perform the wedding or funeral service,\" and later collated in a book, Everyday Sexism (2014). Although the project succeeded with the power of the internet, it also has enabled a backlash. Bates received violent threats, revealing the remaining force of opposition to it. Adding to that, there is an advertisement that portrays negative influences on young girls, which may dominate their way of thinking in the future. A cereal brand, Weetabix illustrates an advertisement that implies only a boy can be a superhero but not a girl.
