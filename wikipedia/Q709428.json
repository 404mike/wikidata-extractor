Though television coverage of darts in Canada is rare and live coverage is almost non-existent, Part was still able to view the World Professional Darts Championship and the World Masters, where he would learn his game from some of the most famous champions in the sport, particularly Bob Anderson. Little is known of Part's formative darts years, but he won his first significant title at the Syracuse Open in 1991 and became a professional in the same year. It is assumed he had great success in the North American circuit as he was soon representing Canada in the WDF World Cup. Part has stated that he was 'produced as a darts player by the North American game', and that his experiences playing against some of the greatest North American players of the time gave him the capability of winning world championships.", "But the disappointment was nothing compared to what would occur in the new year, as 2004 began with one of Part's most disastrous defeats of all. The Canadian entered the 2004 PDC World Championship as the reigning champion, but was unable to win even a single match in the defence of his title. In the first round he came up against debutant Mark Dudbridge but was stunned in a 4\u20133 defeat. Phil Taylor would go on to retake the World Championship crown with a 7\u20136 win over Kevin Painter in the final. In 2004, Part had much success in North America, where he again won the Canadian Open and Canadian National Championships, as well as winning the Golden Harvest North American Cup. Despite Taylor regaining the PDC World Championship, Part once again defeated 'The Power' in the 2004 UK Open quarter-final, with an 8\u20136 win. Part would then go on to reach his only major final of 2004 at the same event, but would once again fail to consolidate as he was soundly beaten 11\u20136 in the final by Roland Scholten. At the 2004 World Matchplay, Part began with a 10\u20130 whitewash of Colin Monk in the first round, and then had an epic win over Bob Anderson in the second round, where Part survived four match darts against him and eventually won in a tiebreak by 17\u201315. In his quarter final match against Andy Jenkins, Part struggled for much of the match and trailed 7\u201311, but Part fought his way back to eventually win 16\u201314, setting up a highly anticipated semi final match against Taylor, with Part having won 3 of his previous 4 matches against Taylor on Sky Sports. Despite Part's recent wins over Taylor on TV, Part started the semi final against Taylor very poorly, averaging in the low 80s and seeing Taylor cruise to an incredible 10\u20130 lead on a mid 90s average, as the 150/1 shot of a 17\u20130 whitewash looked a possibility. However, Part improved his game from the eleventh leg onwards, but losing the first 10 legs had left Part with far too much to do. Part restored plenty of respectability after his poor start, but Taylor won the match 17\u20138. After beating Part, Taylor went on to beat Mark Dudbridge 18\u20138 in the final, to win his fifth consecutive World Matchplay title and his seventh World Matchplay title in all.", "In January 2017, Part was inducted into the PDC Hall of Fame. He was the fourteenth inductee and the first from outside of the United Kingdom \u2013 fitting with his World Championship victories. The award acknowledged his achievements, his contributions as a commentator and pundit, and gentlemanly conduct throughout his career. In the same month, he entered the PDC Qualifying School to gain a tour card having fallen out of the world's top 64. Part won through on the third day; beating Kirk Shepherd at the final stage in a rematch of the 2008 World Championship final. In March 2017, Part returned to Unicorn darts after switching to Cosmo darts, joining fellow World Champions for the company Gary Anderson, John Lowe and Bob Anderson. His success in Qualifying School did not transfer to his 2017 season, where he failed to progress beyond the last 32 stage of a singles event, taking just \u00a32,250 in prize money in the calendar year.
