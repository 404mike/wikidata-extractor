Abu Nowar reverted and suggested this be a feature film, and from there the story begins. While preparing to do the film, Ghandour, Abu Nowar, and producer Rupert Lloyd spent a year in the desert living in Shakrieh village with the local community, learning the Bedouin lifestyle. Initially, the filmmakers planned to have women characters involved. This was hindered by the fact that they wanted to use non-professional actors and found no women from the Bedouin communities willing to act in a film. They considered bringing professional actresses but they did not know the Bedouin dialect, so the film would have lost some of its authenticity. Jack Fox as the British officer was the only professional actor involved; the Bedouins had never participated in any type of acting. Several workshops took place to prepare the Bedouin actors for the film, who were chosen by auditions."]}, {"page": "Riviera (TV series)", "response": ["* Jack Fox as Nico Eltham; Cassandra's son and Daphne\u2019s twin brother.
