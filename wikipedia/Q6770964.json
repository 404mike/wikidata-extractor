The latter comprised 21 paintings and was opened by his good friend, the Lisburn writer Barbara Hunter, whom along with H E Broderick, had contributed a foreword to the 1947 exhibition. The 1949 exhibition included portraits of the stage actors Robert H McCandless, and James G Devlin and the catalogue contained a foreword by the Odd Man Out writer, FL Green. The reviewer for the Lisburn Standard commented,\"Though small in some ways, it is the finest show Nietsche has had in Belfast, for as the years go by he seems to acquire even greater genius in his art, so that he seems at times to almost improve upon nature, adding his own vitality and sensibility to his lovely studies of flowers and fruit.\"The artist also wrote poetry and short stories. He was fluent in Russian, French, German and English. Nietsche parodied local attitudes to modern art in a 1948 play and in 1949 he contributed one poem, A Vision, to the shortlived Ulster poetry journal Rann established by his old friend Barbara Hunter and Roy McFadden in the previous year. His students included Markey Robinson and Jean Osborne.Snoddy, (2002), p.504"]}, {"page": "Cherith McKinstry", "response": ["Her art teacher Romilly Seymour recommended that she train at Belfast College of Art, where she was to meet Basil Blackshaw and T P Flanagan. She maintained a lifelong friendship with Blackshaw. Boyd dated Blackshaw in the early 1950s and painted her portrait in 1958. She studied under Romeo Toogood between 1950 and 1953. Boyd was presented a prize for the best painting and drawing student of 1951 at the opening of the Ulster Arts Club's annual winter exhibition. In 1954 Boyd was the first female recipient of a Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts travel scholarship worth \u00a375, which she used to study in Italy and France. Boyd was particularly interested in studying Florentine sculptors and their modern counterparts. A Roman Scene was later one of 145 works selected from a thousand submissions for an exhibition at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery in 1957. Boyd exhibited with eight recent graduates at the YMCA Hall in Belfast in 1954. Exhibitors included Raymond Piper, TP Flanagan, Basil Blackshaw and Markey Robinson. In the same year Boyd contributed a sculpture to the British Industries Fair at Earl's Court, one of six Ulster artists to show work, including Mercy Hunter, George MacCann and Dan O'Neill.
