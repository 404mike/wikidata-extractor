Toulouse kicked off and managed to regain possession. Toulouse dominated the early parts of the game, and although they missed a penalty goal five minutes into the game, scrum-half Jean-Baptiste \u00c9lissalde successfully kicked a drop goal after eight minutes to give them a 3\u20130 lead. Toulouse continued to dominate territory but Munster winger Doug Howlett made a break in the 29th minute setting up a ruck close to the Toulouse try-line. Munster number eight Denis Leamy then broke from a ruck and attempted to place the ball over the try-line, but lost it forward in the process. From the resulting scrum, Toulouse were pushed off their own ball and Munster gained possession from which Leamy scored. The try was converted by Ronan O'Gara to give Munster a 7\u20133 lead after 33 minutes. Three minutes later, Munster were awarded a penalty after Toulouse captain Fabien Pelous was caught not rolling away in the ruck. O'Gara kicked the penalty to extend Munster's lead to 10\u20133. On the 40-minute mark, Leamy was penalised for going into a ruck off his feet and \u00c9lissalde kicked the penalty to reduce Munster's lead to four points at half-time.", "Ten minutes into the second half, Munster centre Rua Tipoki threw a pass that would have given a try to Howlett, but the pass was deemed forward. One minute later Toulouse's Pelous kicked Munster flanker Alan Quinlan after Quinlan had stood on Pelous' hand. After the intervention of touch judge Nigel Whitehouse, Pelous was shown a yellow card for his part in the incident and sent to the sin bin for 10 minutes. O'Gara kicked Munster's resulting penalty to give his team a 13\u20136 lead after 51 minutes. Three minutes later, Toulouse fullback C\u00e9dric Heymans threw the ball into himself, then kicked ahead before collecting his own kick. He then chipped ahead which Toulouse's Yannick Jauzion kicked once more before wing Yves Donguy grounded the ball to give Toulouse a try. Elissalde converted the try to tie the scores at 13\u201313 after 54 minutes. Pelous returned from the sin-bin in the 61st minute, and four minutes later was penalised yet again for not rolling away in the ruck. O'Gara kicked the penalty which gave Munster a 16\u201313 lead. For most of the remaining time, Munster employed the pick-and-go technique, where the forwards would drive the ball from ruck to ruck in an effort to retain possession and use up time. Munster were penalised in the 78th minute after 17 phases of play; the ball was kicked downfield by Toulouse who counter-attacked. Munster turned the ball over, however, and won a kickable penalty with ten seconds left on the clock. Referee Nigel Owens stopped the clock until the penalty was taken; because of the risk of Toulouse recovering possession, the options of kicking for goal and kicking for touch were ruled out. Instead, Ronan O'Gara tapped the penalty and went into contact. With the ten seconds used up, the ball became unplayable in the collapsed maul, Owens blew the final whistle, and Munster had won 16\u201313."]}, {"page": "2007 Rugby World Cup Pool D", "response": ["Nigel Owens (Wales)", "Nigel Owens (Wales)", "Nigel Owens (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2007 Rugby World Cup Pool A", "response": ["Nigel Owens (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2007 Rugby World Cup Pool B", "response": ["Nigel Owens (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2007 Rugby World Cup Pool C", "response": ["Nigel Owens (Wales)"]}, {"page": "2007 Rugby World Cup knockout stage", "response": ["Nigel Owens (Wales)", "Nigel Owens (Wales)", "Nigel Owens (Wales)", "Nigel Owens (Wales)"]}]}}
