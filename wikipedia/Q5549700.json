He was a Reuters correspondent while in China for two years in the 1930s, and wrote a book China Changes (1936).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["According to Crowley, Reuss had named him head of the O.T.O. upon his death, but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.T.O., Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker. Tr\u00e4nker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha K\u00fcntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tr\u00e4nker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended the homosexual journalist Tom Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little attention at the time."]}, {"page": "Israel Regardie", "response": ["Through Crowley's work, Regardie moved from the practice of yoga to that of ceremonial magic. When Crowley asked Regardie to travel to Paris to serve as his personal secretary, the young man agreed; he told his parents that he would be studying with an English painter in Paris. In October 1928, Regardie sailed from New York City to Paris. Regardie hoped that Crowley would personally instruct him in occult practices, but this did not occur; Crowley expected his pupils to learn things for themselves and only seek his advice when in difficulty. Crowley urged Regardie to overcome his inhibitions, including by visiting prostitutes to lose his virginity; from one of these encounters he reportedly contracted gonorrhoea. Regardie spent much time studying Crowley's material, both published and unpublished. As a magical name, he took \"Frater NChSh\" (\"The Serpent\"), although also became known as \"Father Scorpio\". Through his involvement with Crowley, Regardie came to know Gerald Yorke, although the duo never became friends. Crowley would sometimes play two simultaneous games of chess, one with Regardie and the other with Yorke."]}, {"page": "Doreen Valiente", "response": ["Gardner spent his summers at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, and thus often relied on Valiente to deal with his affairs in Southern England. He sent her to meet the occult artist Austin Osman Spare when he wanted some talismans produced by the latter. Spare subsequently described Valiente as \"a myopic stalky nymph... harmless and a little tiresome\" in a letter that he wrote to Kenneth Grant. At Gardner's prompting, she also met with the occultist Gerald Yorke, who was interested in learning about Wicca; Gardner insisted that she lie to Yorke by informing him that she was from a longstanding family of hereditary Wiccan practitioners. She also aided him in preparing his second non-fiction book about Wicca, The Meaning of Witchcraft, focusing in particular on those sections refuting the sensationalist accusations of the tabloid press."]}, {"page": "Grady Louis McMurtry", "response": ["At this time, McMurtry decided to restore the Order by invoking his emergency orders from Crowley which gave him authority (subject to Karl Germer's approval) to \"take charge of the whole work of the Order in California to reform the Organization\", and he assumed the title \"Caliph of O.T.O.,\" as specified in Crowley's letters to McMurtry from the 1940s. His witnesses were Dr. Israel Regardie (1907\u20131985) and Gerald Yorke, who both offered their support."]}, {"page": "Lady Frieda Harris", "response": ["After her husband's death in 1952, she moved to India. She died in Srinagar on 11 May 1962. She bequeathed the original paintings of her Tarot cards to fellow Thelemite Gerald Yorke, who in turned placed them with the Warburg Institute along with much other Crowley material that he had collected over the years. However, Yorke retained several alternative versions of the cards and some preliminary studies which he later sold through bookdealer Harold Mortlake.  "]}]}}
