The following season, he was the team's top try scorer, with 16 tries to his name. In the 1905\u201306 season, Cardiff was undefeated except against the touring All Blacks in December 1905. In the run up to that encounter, Cardiff played Blackheath on 9 December. Williams did not play: the Welsh Rugby Union requested that Cardiff field Willie Llewellyn of Pennygraig and Teddy Morgan of London Welsh, who would be representing Wales against New Zealand the following week, alongside Cardiff's centres Nicholls and Gabe. Instead, the same day, Williams took the place of Morgan at London Welsh against Harlequins. Wales won 3\u20130 against New Zealand, and became the first team in 27 games to beat the tourists.

Williams' first touch of the ball was erratic, failing to hold on to a catch in the initial stages, when he had a clear run to the tryline. After Cardiff had scored two tries in the first half with no response from the Springboks, Williams had another chance to score, but again fumbled the ball. At half time, Cardiff was leading by 11 points, already the largest score against the South Africans in any of the tour matches. Well into the second half, Williams received a pass from Rhys Gabe. Between him and the tryline was Marsberg, the opposition fullback, and \"one of the most magnificent tacklers\" to have played in Wales. Williams approached Marsberg and, with a swerving run, \"diddled\" him, and scored a try in the corner. Marsberg then ran up to him and shook him by the hand in recognition of the move.

On the morning of the match, Rees informed the WRU that he was ineligible to play, which would have opened the way for nominated reserve, and Swansea's captain, Frank Gordon to gain his first international cap. The WRU reacted harshly to this, and reinstated Nicholls as they believed that Rees was following club orders to give their captain an international cap. The St Helen's crowd booed Nicholls and even pelted him with mud and oranges during the team photo, reacting badly to what was a snub to their captain and their team.
