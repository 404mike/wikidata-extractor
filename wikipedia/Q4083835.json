He served a three months prison sentence as part of the \"32 Process\", was deported from the country and died in 1867 in Rome hospital, after having been injured, as a member of the Giuseppe Garibaldi's squad. Arthur Benni's activities and persona caused controversy in Russia where rumours of him being a spy and a 3rd Department agent were being spread, much to his outrage and distress. Ivan Turgenev and Nikolai Leskov did much to clear Benni's name. The latter (who chose Benni as a prototype for Rainer, the No Way Out novel's revolutionary character) wrote a posthumous essay on him called The Mystery Man.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nikolai Leskov", "response": ["In January 1861 Leskov moved to Saint Peterburg where he stayed at Professor Ivan Vernadsky's along with Zemlya i volya member Andrey NechiporenkoArrested on 28 July 1862, Nechiporenko reported Leskov to the police, stating that the latter had had a \"harmful influence\" on him. and met Taras Shevchenko. For a short while he moved to Moscow and started to work for the Russkaya Retch newspaper, all the while contributing to Otechestvennye Zapiski. In December he left Russkaya Retch (for personal, rather than ideological reasons) and moved back to Saint Peterburg where in January 1862 he joined the staff of the Northern Bee (Severnaya ptchela), a liberal newspaper edited by Pavel Usov. There Leskov met journalist Arthur Benni, a Polish-born British citizen, with whom he forged a great friendship and later came to defend, as leftist radicals in Petersburg started to spread rumours about his being \"an English spy\" and having links with the 3rd Department. For Severnaya ptchela Leskov (now writing as M. Stebnitsky, a pseudonym he used in 1862\u20131869) became the head of the domestic affairs department, writing sketches and articles on every possible aspect of everyday life, and also critical pieces, targeting what was termed nihilism and \"vulgar materialism\". He had some support at the time, from several prominent journalists, among them Grigory Eliseev, who wrote in the April 1862, Sovremennik issue: \"Those lead columns in Ptchela make one pity the potential that is being spent there, still unrealised elsewhere.\" At a time of intense public excitement, as D. S. Mirsky pointed out, Leskov was \"absorbed by the public interest as much as anyone, but his eminently practical mind and training made it impossible for him to join unreservedly any of the very impractical and hot-headed parties of the day. Hence his isolation when, in the spring of  1862, an incident occurred that had a lasting effect on his career.\""]}, {"page": "Benni", "response": ["* Arthur Benni (1839\u20131867), a Polish-born English journalist and activist"]}, {"page": "Alexandra Jacobi", "response": ["Aleksandra Jacobi became and active member of the proto-Socialist 1860s movement in Russia and as one of this country's first feminists. In 1866, along with her husband she came to Italy and settled in Rome. A year later, she joined the Garibaldi forces as a sister of mercy and worked for a while as a Russian correspondent for Golos, reporting from the frontlines. Arthur Benni, whom she attended to in hospital during the last days of his life, died in December 1867, apparently in her arms. Several colourful biographies dealt with her seemingly extraordinary adventures in Italy, but later it transpired (from her own diaries and notes) that much of Jacobi's life of that period has been heavily romanticised and to some extent mythologised."]}]}}
