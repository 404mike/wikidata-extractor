He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1915. His great season was 1919 when, after completing his university studies, he opened regularly for Surrey with Jack Hobbs and scored 1,588 runs at an average of more than 45 runs per innings, with seven centuries. That season, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote, \"people went to The Oval to see Hobbs and Knight open the Surrey innings. Many then did not know, or care to ask, which was which, satisfied to watch the joint approach to perfection.\"In a county match in 1920, Knight was struck on the head while fielding and was never quite the same batsman again. Nevertheless, in 1921 he was picked for two Test matches against the all-conquering Australians but scored only 54 runs in four innings. However, in the First Test his 38 in the second innings was England's highest score in the match.He became a teacher at Westminster School, where he was master in charge of cricket for many years. After the 1921 season he appeared only occasionally for Surrey, mostly in the summer holidays, retiring after playing 12 games in 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1960", "response": ["* January 5 \u2013 Donald Knight, English cricketer (b. 1894)"]}, {"page": "1914 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Johnny Douglas, Percy Fender, Wally Hardinge, Donald Knight, Sydney Smith "]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Donald Knight"]}, {"page": "Tom Hayward", "response": ["Despite a gradual decline in his athleticism in his later career, Hayward remained an effective batsman well into his forties, and in June 1913 he scored his hundredth first-class century, becoming only the second batsman (after W. G. Grace) to achieve this feat. He made his 104th and final hundred in August 1914 against Yorkshire at Lord's (where Surrey played several \"home\" matches after World War I had begun), but made just one in his last innings of all, against Gloucestershire back at The Oval and on grounds of age did not resume his career after the end of hostilities.

The match ended when Hobbs and Jack Crawford scored the 95 runs required for victory in the final innings in 30 minutes; 45 minutes had been available and in most circumstances such a required rate of scoring made a draw almost inevitable. Hobbs scored 47 not out.McKinstry, pp. 183\u201384. All of the benefit money, supplemented by a \u00a3100 grant from Surrey, was given directly to Hobbs. Usually, the committee invested part of the sum on the player's behalf but they waived this practice for Hobbs. He used it to open a sports shop in London which he ran for the rest of his life.McKinstry, pp. 184\u201385.Arlott, p. 77. Also during the season, Hobbs first opened the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner. Sandham was initially unsuccessful, and Hobbs' partner later in the season was Donald Knight, but the pair later established an extremely effective opening partnership.McKinstry, pp. 179\u201380.
