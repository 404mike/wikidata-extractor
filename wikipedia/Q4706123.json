He did not bat as Alan Barber (100) and Edgar Oldroyd (143) put on 203 for the second wicket, to help Yorkshire post 320 for 4.  He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.  Batting at number eleven, he fell leg before wicket to Tommy Mitchell for three runs, and his only success with the ball came when he dismissed Stan Worthington, caught by Frank Dennis, for six.  He finished with a first-class career bowling average of 30.00."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927", "response": ["Worsley captained for just two seasons. He struggled with the demands of fielding, while his batting was disappointing. However, he was widely respected by the team. He was slightly more effective in his second season as leader, after which he retired.Woodhouse, p. 359. The next skipper, Alan Barber, although regarded as successful, captained for just one season. He was a more accomplished batsman and a great disciplinarian.Hill, pp. 108\u20139. However, he chose a career in teaching, limiting his availability, and resigned. The captain after that, Frank Greenwood, also did not hold the post long, resigning due to business commitments. Lord Hawke, writing in 1932, noted there had been eight captains since he retired in 1910. While six of them won the County Championship in their first season in charge, he stated that \"it is not good for a side to be always changing its captain\". Only when Brian Sellers was appointed in 1933 did Yorkshire gain the leader they wanted. After skippering most games in 1932 during Greenwood's frequent absences, he remained in the role until 1947 and was considered the best county captain of his time."]}, {"page": "Barber (surname)", "response": ["* Alan Barber (1905\u20131985), English amateur first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1928\u20131932)", "response": ["Sutcliffe's first-class aggregate in 1930 was 2,312 runs at 64.22 with 6 centuries and a highest score of 173 against Sussex.  Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind Lancashire and Gloucestershire.Webber, p.67.  Alan Barber replaced William Worsley as Yorkshire's amateur captain but played for one season only.  Of greater significance was the retirement of the man who many saw as the true Yorkshire captain, Wilfred Rhodes.  But one legend was replaced by another as Hedley Verity immediately stepped into Rhodes' boots, making 10 championship appearances and taking 52 wickets.  Sutcliffe made only 13 appearances in the championship as a result of Test calls and his thumb injury.  The team in 1930 lacked balance with a lot of changes taking place but a typical line-up was Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Mitchell, Robinson, Wood, Rhodes or Verity, Alan Barber, Macaulay and Bowes.  The likes of Wilf Barber, Frank Dennis and future captain Frank Greenwood made occasional appearances."]}, {"page": "List of Yorkshire cricket captains", "response": ["* 1930 \u2013 1930 Alan Barber"]}, {"page": "Alan Barber (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Barber"]}]}}
