He retired in 1870. He was secretary of the Linnean Society of London from 1840 to 1860. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1841, and was elected member of Leopoldina in 1864.\nOn the evening of 30 June 1858, Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker passed on to him papers by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, titled \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\" respectively. \nAs secretary of the Linnean Society at a meeting on the following evening, 1 July, he read out the papers together with a covering note by Lyell and Hooker. \nThis was the joint publication by Darwin and Wallace of their papers setting out the theory of natural selection, which was received quietly at the time but attracted wide interest when Darwin published On the Origin of Species eighteen months later.\nThe standard author abbreviation Benn. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)", "response": ["After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first Keeper of the Botanical Department, remaining so until his death.

Mrs. Hooker had spent the afternoon copying out extracts from the handwritten documents Darwin had sent with his letter of the previous night, presumably chosen by Hooker to suit the verbal presentation, and Lyell and Hooker wrote a short introductory letter. The papers entitled respectively On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, incorporated Wallace's pages; and extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray. At the meeting the Secretary read the papers out, before going on to six other papers, and there was no discussion of them at the end of the meeting, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with including an obituary notice for Robert Brown given by Lyell, or possibly due to reluctance to speak out against a theory supported by the eminent Lyell and Hooker. Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition, presided over the meeting. He apparently disapproved, and in his annual presidential report presented in May 1859 wrote that \"The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear\". However, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.."]}, {"page": "Bennettitales", "response": ["The Cycadeoideaceae (originally \u201cCycadeoideae\u201d) were named by English geologist William Buckland in 1828, from fossil trunks found in Jurassic strata on the Isle of Portland, England, which Buckland gave the genus name Cycadeoidea. Buckland provided a description of the family and two species, but failed to give a description of the genus, which has led to Buckland's description of the family being considered invalid by modern taxonomic standards. In publications in 1870, Scottish botanist William Carruthers and English paleobotanist William Crawford Williamson described the first known reproductive organs of the Bennettitales from Jurassic strata of Yorkshire and Jurassic-Cretaceous strata of the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Portland. Caruthers was the first to recognise that Bennettitales had distinct differences from cycads, and established the tribes \"Williamsonieae\" and \"Bennettiteae\", with the latter being named after the genus Bennettites named by Caruthers in the same publication, the name being in honour of British botanist John Joseph Bennett. The order Bennettitales was erected German botanist Adolf Engler in 1892, who recognised the group as separate from the Cycadales.Engler, H.G.A. 1892. Syllabus der Vorlesungen \u00fcber specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik. xxiii + 184 pp. Gebr. Borntraeger, Berlin The Anthophyte hypothesis erected by Arber and Parking in 1907 posited that angiosperms arose from Bennettitales, as suggested by the wood-like structures and rudimentary flowers. Based on morphological data, however, Bennettitales were classified as a monophyletic group when paired with Gnetales. a study in 2006 suggested that Bennettitales, Angiosperms, and Gigantopteridales form a clade based on the presence of oleanane. A 2007 study examining phase-contrast X-ray images of gymnosperm seeds suggested that the supported the Anthophyte hypothesis. Evidence from seed coats suggest that Bennettitales form a clade with the gymnosperm orders of Gnetales and Erdtmanithecales. Molecular evidence has consistently contradicted the Anthophyte hypothesis, finding that Angiosperms are the sister group to all living gymnosperms, including Gnetales. A 2017 phylogeny based on molecular signatures of fossilised cuticles found that Bennettitales were more closely related to the Ginkgo+Cycads clade than conifers, and were closely related to Nilssonia and Ptilozamites."]}, {"page": "Aphloia", "response": ["The genus Aphloia was described by John Joseph Bennett in 1840 and included in Flacourtiaceae, where most authors continued to include it until Armen Takhtajan recognized its misplacement and created the new family Aphloiaceae in Violales to accommodate it.
