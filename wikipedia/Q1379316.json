Consequently, Shackleton decided to risk an open-boat journey to the 720-nautical-mile-distant South Georgia whaling stations, where he knew help was available. The strongest of the tiny  lifeboats, christened  after the expedition's chief sponsor, was chosen for the trip. Ship's carpenter Harry McNish made various improvements, including raising the sides, strengthening the keel, building a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, and sealing the work with oil paint and seal blood."]}, {"page": "List of sailors", "response": ["*Harry McNish, Scottish carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition"]}, {"page": "Port Glasgow", "response": ["*Harry McNish"]}, {"page": "Voyage of the James Caird", "response": ["Of the three lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed the strongest and most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee philanthropist whose sponsorship had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter, Harry McNish, strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the seas of the Southern Ocean, sealing his makeshift wood and canvas deck with lamp wick, oil paint and seal blood.", "The South Georgia boat party could expect to meet hurricane-force winds and waves\u2014the notorious Cape Horn Rollers\u2014measuring from trough to crest as much as . Shackleton therefore selected the heaviest and strongest of the three boats, the  long James Caird. It had been built as a whaleboat in London to Worsley's orders, designed on the \"double-ended\" principle pioneered by Norwegian shipbuilder Colin Archer. Knowing that a heavily-laden open sea voyage was now unavoidable, Shackleton had already asked the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish to modify the boats during the weeks the expedition spent at Patience Camp. Using material taken from Endurance's fourth boat, a small motor launch which had been broken up with this purpose in mind before the ship's final loss, McNish had raised the sides of the James Caird and the Dudley Docker by 8\u201310 inches (20\u201325\u00a0cm). Now in the primitive camp on Elephant Island, McNish was again asked if he could make the James Caird more seaworthy. Using improvised tools and materials, McNish built a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing his work with oil paints, lamp wick, and seal blood. The craft was strengthened by having the mast of the Dudley Docker lashed inside, along the length of her keel. She was then fitted as a ketch, with her own mainmast and a mizzenmast made by cutting down the mainmast from the Stancomb-Wills, rigged to carry lug sails and a jib. The weight of the boat was increased by the addition of approximately 1 long ton (1 tonne) of ballast, to lessen the risk of capsizing in the high seas that Shackleton knew they would encounter. Worsley believed that too much extra ballast (formed from rocks, stones and shingle taken from the beach) was added, making the boat excessively heavy, giving an extremely uncomfortable 'stiff' motion and hampering the  performance for sailing upwind or into the weather. However he acknowledged that Shackleton's biggest concern was preventing the boat capsizing during the open-ocean crossing."]}, {"page": "Tom Crean (explorer)", "response": ["Upon reaching Elephant Island, Crean was one of the \"four fittest men\" detailed by Shackleton to find a safe camping-ground.Shackleton, p. 147 Shackleton decided that, rather than waiting for a rescue ship that would probably never arrive, one of the lifeboats should be strengthened so that a crew could sail it to South Georgia and arrange a rescue. After the party was settled on a penguin rookery above the high-water mark, a group of men led by ship's carpenter Harry McNish began modifying one of the lifeboats\u2014the James Caird\u2014in preparation for this journey, which Shackleton would lead. Frank Wild, who would be in command of the party remaining on Elephant Island, wanted the dependable Crean to stay with him; Shackleton initially agreed, but changed his mind after Crean begged to be included in the boat's crew of six.Shackleton, p. 158"]}, {"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["Before the march could begin, Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot, including the carpenter Harry McNish's cat, Mrs Chippy, and a pup which had become a pet of the surgeon Macklin.Shackleton 1919, pp.\u00a081\u201382. The company set out on 30 October 1915, with two of the ship's lifeboats carried on sledges. Problems quickly arose as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened. According to Hurley the surface became \"a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges\" in which barely a square yard was smooth.

They gave the name \"Ocean Camp\" to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. Parties continued to revisit the Endurance wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21\u00a0November, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.Shackleton 1919, p.\u00a098."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["Two pressure waves struck the ship on 29 August without incident. On the evening of 31 August, a slow-building pressure gripped the Endurance, causing her hull and timbers to creak and shudder continuously. The ice around the ship moved and broke throughout the night, battering the port side of the hull. All was quiet again until the afternoon of 30 September, by which time there were signs of spring with ten hours of sunlight per day and occasional temperature readings above freezing. A large floe was swept against the Endurance's port bow and then gripped that side of the ship against the built-up ice and snow on her starboard beam. The ship's structure groaned and wracked under the strain. Carpenter Harry McNish noted that the solid oak beams supporting the upper deck were being visibly bent \"like a piece of cane\". On deck the ship's masts were whipping back and forth as their stepping points on the keel were distorted. Despite these disconcerting signs, Captain Frank Worsley noted that the strength of the ship's structure was causing the ice itself to break up as it piled against the hull \u2013 \"...just as it appears she can stand no more, the huge floe weighing possibly a million tons or more yields to our little ship by cracking across...and so relieves the pressure. The behaviour of our ship in the ice has been magnificent. Undoubtedly she is the finest little wooden vessel ever built....\" Despite this, the ship's decks were permanently buckled following this ordeal."]}, {"page": "Frank Worsley", "response": ["It quickly became apparent that Elephant Island,  of rock and ice with little shelter, was not a welcoming environment particularly with winter approaching and most of the expedition members weakened by their ordeal. Furthermore, the expedition could not be expected to be spotted by search parties or passing whalers. Within days of landing on Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to take a small party and sail the largest lifeboat, the James Caird, named for one of the expedition's sponsors, to South Georgia,  away. From there he would obtain a ship and return for the remainder of his men. Worsley, whose navigational skills had impressed Shackleton, volunteered to accompany him. The James Caird, originally built to Worsley's specifications, was about  long and the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish, immediately set about improving its seaworthiness. On 24 April, the weather dawned clear and after being provisioned with 30 days of supplies, the boat left Elephant Island. Worsley was faced with the task of navigating the Southern Ocean to South Georgia. There was no margin for error as the James Caird would sail into the South Atlantic if he missed the island; this would mean almost certain death for those in the lifeboat, as well as for those remaining on Elephant Island. Fortuitously, the weather was fine on the day of departure from the island and this allowed Worsley to obtain a sun sighting to ensure that his chronometer was rated."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish place names in other countries", "response": ["*McNish Island (Harry McNish)"]}, {"page": "1930 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 24 September \u2013 Harry McNish, carpenter, Antarctic explorer (born 1874)"]}, {"page": "Harry \"Chippy\" McNeish", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry McNish"]}, {"page": "Henry McNeish", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry McNish"]}, {"page": "Harry McNeish", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry McNish"]}, {"page": "Harry \"Chippy\" McNish", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry McNish"]}, {"page": "McNish Island", "response": ["McNish Island () is the larger of two islands lying at the east side of Cheapman Bay on the south side of South Georgia.
