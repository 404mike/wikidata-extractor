The play, written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, had Julie Andrews fresh from her triumph in My Fair Lady playing Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as Lancelot completing the love triangle. Roddy McDowall played the villainous Mordred. Hart first came up with the proposal to Burton after learning from Lerner about his ability to sing. Burton consulted Olivier on whether he should take the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week. Olivier pointed out this salary was good and that he should accept the offer. The production was troubled, with both Loewe and Hart falling ill and the pressure was building due to great expectations and huge advance sales. The show's running time was nearly five hours. Burton's intense preparation and competitive desire to succeed served him well. He immediately drafted Philip, who revised the musical's script and cut its running time to three hours while also incorporating three new songs. Burton was generous and supportive to everyone throughout the production and coached the understudies himself. According to Lerner, \"he kept the boat from rocking, and Camelot might never have reached New York if it hadn't been for him\". Burton's reviews were excellent, with the critic from Time magazine observing that Richard \"gives Arthur the skillful and vastly appealing performance that might be expected from one of England's finest young actors\". Broadway theatre reviewer Walter Kerr noted Richard's syllables, \"sing, the account of his wrestling the stone from the sword becomes a bravura passage of house-hushing brilliance\" and complemented his duets with Andrews, finding Burton's rendition to possess \"a sly and fretful and mocking accent to take care of the  without destroying the man\"."]}, {"page": "Sleepy Hollow (film)", "response": ["While Johnny Depp was Burton's first choice for the role of Ichabod Crane, Paramount required him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl,\" Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in Death on the Nile. \"It's good,\" Burton reasoned, \"because I'm not the greatest action director, or the greatest director in any genre, and he's not the greatest action star, or the greatest star in any genre.\" Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that \"the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had.\" Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Shreck in Batman Returns) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (Ed Wood) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's Batman films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement.
