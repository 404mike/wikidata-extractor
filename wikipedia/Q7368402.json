Damien's unorthodox (and unethical) methods are undeniably a hit with the viewers, and therefore he is popular with Sir Roysten and Gus, making it impossible for George to fire him, despite his frequent desire to do so. Damien is quite happy to stage incidents for the camera, arguing when challenged that he is making \"reconstructions\" of what would have happened. When filming a firing-squad execution in a South American dictatorship, Damien asked the officer for a retake so he could make the execution look better. When filming in a war-torn country he punched a small boy in the face to make sure he had a crying child in shot, and threw a hand-grenade over a wall to create panic before delivering his piece to camera. Perhaps surprisingly, he is generally open-minded about other cultures, expressing interest in Tarot cards and the predictions of Nostradamus. He likes to keep himself fit, does not drink or smoke, drives a Porsche and is considered to be sociopathic. A psychologist who visits the office to carry out a study of workplace stress describes Damien's personality as \"completely stress-free. Psychotic, but stress-free\". Some indication as to why Damien became the driven, amoral individual he is was provided when his mother, Professor Avril Day (Rosemary Martin), made a one-off appearance: she was a nuclear physicist who had unrealistically high expectations of her son, rarely if ever praised him and constantly pressured him to achieve. Damien gets his kicks from danger and excitement, and has virtually no interest in actual sex, except in one episode at the end of Series 4, in which he loses his virginity to a similarly danger-obsessed GlobeLink weather girl. Despite his high opinion of himself, Damien's frequent breaches of ethical standards do not go unnoticed by other stations and he fails job interviews in the final series. After going off to film a piece on an Amazonian tribe, Damien is made a God by the natives \u2013 who refuse to let him return to civilisation."]}, {"page": "Private Lives", "response": ["In 1963, at the start of what Coward called \"Dad's Renaissance\", a London revival directed by James Roose-Evans at the Hampstead Theatre Club heralded Coward's return to critical favour.\"Timeless Revival of Coward\", The Times, 26 April 1963, p. 6 The success of the production, with Edward de Souza as Elyot and Rosemary Martin as Amanda, led to its transfer to the Duke of York's Theatre.Fay, Gerard. \"Private Lives at the Duke of York's\", The Guardian, 4 July 1963, p. 7 The West End producer wanted to cast established stars in the transfer, but Coward insisted that the young Hampstead cast should be retained.Hoare, p. 480 It ran in the West End for 212 performances.Coward (2007), p. 709 A May 1968 Off-Broadway production directed by Charles Nelson Reilly starred Elaine Stritch as Amanda, and ran for nine performances at the Theatre de Lys.Sullivan, Dan. \"The Theater: 'Private Lives' Revived; Noel Coward's Farce Stars Elaine Stritch\".

Maurice's girlfriend, Vera Parkinson, was played by Rosemary Martin in the first series. In the second and third series (during which Maurice and Vera marry), Vera was played by Lynda Baron. A running gag is Froggitt's mother saying \"Don't open that cupboard our Selwyn, things fall out!\" whenever he opens the cupboard in the Froggitt front room, before objects fall from it. Froggitt is on the committee of his local working men's club, serving as concert secretary in charge of booking \"turns\". Froggitt's colleagues on the committee are the dour Scouser Jack (Bill Dean), Harry (Harold Goodwin) and excitable, stereotypical Welshman Clive (Richard Davies), often referred to as Taff by Selwyn. All decisions taken by the club committee are taken on a \"show of hands...\" and \"carried unanimously\". In keeping with the A Midsummer Night's Dream characterisations, Maynard saw the committee as the mechanicals. Froggitt is incompetent at everything he turns his hand to, being equally inept at his day job (digging holes and filling them in), do-it-yourself at home, and booking acts for the club. Nevertheless, he is honest and hard-working, unlike the other committee members, who usually sit back in comfort while Froggitt does the manual labour. They generally tolerate him because he is prepared to volunteer for unwanted tasks. Barman at the club is Raymond (Ray Mort), often seen answering the telephone with a number of highly fictitious and fanciful addresses."]}, {"page": "Bill Brand (TV series)", "response": ["Produced as one series of eleven episodes, Bill Brand stars Jack Shepherd in the title role.
