During April 1965, the British government announced that it had decided to withdraw its order for the TSR-2, leaving it without an established customer. By this point, the programme was already in the prototype phase and the aircraft had already flown, but political pressure forced development work to cease, leading to the remaining airframes and most supporting equipment and documentation to be destroyed.Burke 2010, pp. 109, 276.\"Sir Frederick Page.\" The Daily Telegraph, 7 May 2005.
