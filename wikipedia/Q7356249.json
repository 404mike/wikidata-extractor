In a game against Swansea Town in September, Revie dropped many senior players and played Charlton in a young new defensive line-up: Gary Sprake (goalkeeper), Paul Reaney (right-back), Norman Hunter and Charlton (centre-back), and Rod Johnson (left-back). With the exception of Johnson, this defensive line-up would remain consistent for much of the rest of the decade. Charlton took charge of the defence that day, and insisted upon a zonal marking system; Revie agreed to allow Charlton to become the key organiser in defence. Aided by new midfield signing Johnny Giles, Leeds put in a strong promotion challenge and finished fifth, before securing promotion as champions in the 1963\u201364 campaign, topping the table two points ahead of Sunderland. Other players that began to make their mark on the first team included Billy Bremner, Paul Madeley and Peter Lorimer."]}, {"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["|Rod Johnson||||1970s||||", "*  Rod Johnson"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Rod Johnson||||1973\u20131979||192||16||"]}, {"page": "Rod Johnson", "response": ["Rod Johnson may refer to:", "* Rod Johnson (footballer) (1945-2019), English retired football player", "* Rod Johnson (politician), former Oregon state legislator", "* Rod Johnson (programmer), founder of the Spring Framework, an open source application framework for Java"]}, {"page": "Rod (given name)", "response": ["* Rod Johnson (footballer) (born 1945), English retired football player", "* Rod Johnson (programmer), founder of the Spring Framework, an open source application framework for Java"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 in English football", "response": ["* 16 December 2019: Rod Johnson, 74, Leeds United, Doncaster Rovers, Rotherham United and Bradford City midfielder."]}, {"page": "Rodney Johnson (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rod Johnson (footballer)"]}]}}
