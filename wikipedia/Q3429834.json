In later life, Lawrence arranged to pay a military colleague to administer beatings to him, and to be subjected to severe formal tests of fitness and stamina.Knightley and Simpson, p. 29 John Bruce first wrote on this topic, including some other statements that were not credible, but Lawrence's biographers regard the beatings as established fact.Wilon, 1989, chapter 34.

Phillip suggested that the Petra arc of the novel was anticlimactic. Upon hearing this criticism, Card rethought this entire book and decided to split it into two books. At the time of publication, Card thought the Bean series (Shadow series) of the Enderverse would only be four books long.Orson Scott Card, Shadow of the Hegemon (Tor Books, 2000).

The film was discussed or reviewed in Newsweek, Time, the Washington Post, The Public Historian, Cross Currents, The Journal of Asian Studies, Film Quarterly, The Progressive, The Christian Century and elsewhere. Ben Kingsley's performance was especially praised. Among the few who took a more negative view of the film, historian Lawrence James called it \"pure hagiography\" while anthropologist Akhil Gupta said it \"suffers from tepid direction and a superficial and misleading interpretation of history.\" Also Indian novelist Makarand R. Paranjape has  written that \"Gandhi, though hagiographical, follow a mimetic style of film-making in which cinema, the visual image itself, is supposed to portray or reflect 'reality'\". The film was also criticised by some right-wing commentators who objected to the film's advocacy of nonviolence, including Pat Buchanan, Emmett Tyrrell, and especially Richard Grenier. In Time, Richard Schickel wrote that in portraying Gandhi's \"spiritual presence... Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.\" A \"singular virtue\" of the film is that \"its title figure is also a character in the usual dramatic sense of the term.\" Schickel viewed Attenborough's directorial style as having \"a conventional handsomeness that is more predictable than enlivening,\" but this \"stylistic self-denial serves to keep one's attention fastened where it belongs: on a persuasive, if perhaps debatable vision of Gandhi's spirit, and on the remarkable actor who has caught its light in all its seasons.\"  Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and called it a \"remarkable experience\", and placed it 5th on his 10 best films of 1983.Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967 to Present.

It has long been held that the Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britain in large numbers in the 5th and 6th centuries, substantially displacing the British people. The Anglo-Saxon historian Frank Stenton in 1943, although making considerable allowance for British survival, essentially sums up this view, arguing \"that the greater part of southern England was overrun in the first phase of the war\".F.M. Stenton, The Anglo-Saxons, 3rd edition, (Oxford: University Press, 1973), p.30 This interpretation was based on the written sources, particularly Gildas but also the later sources such as the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede, that cast the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons as a violent event. The toponymic and linguistic evidence was also considered to support this interpretation, as very few British place names survived in eastern Britain, very few British Celtic words entered the Old English language and the Brythonic language and peoples migrated from south-western Britain to Armorica, which eventually became Brittany. This interpretation particularly appealed to earlier English historians, who wanted to further their view that England had developed differently from Europe, with a limited monarchy and love of liberty. This, it was argued, came from the mass Anglo-Saxon invasions. While this view was never universal\u00a0\u2013 Edward Gibbon believed that there had been a great deal of British survival\u00a0\u2013 it was the dominant paradigm. Though many scholars would now employ this argument, the traditional view is still held by many other historians, Lawrence James writing in 2002 that England was \"submerged by an Anglo-Saxon current which swept away the Romano-British.\"Lawrence James, Warrior Race, (London: Abacus. 2002), p.30"]}, {"page": "Alleged British use of chemical weapons in Mesopotamia in 1920", "response": ["Another historian, Lawrence James, stated, \"By September the local commander, General Sir Aylmer Haldane, was beginning to get the upper hand, although he was still desperate enough to clamour for large supplies of poison gas.

Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe. Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century.James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (1997) pp. 307\u2013318", "In recent decades numerous scholars have tried their hand at one volume surveys including T.
