He made 123 appearances in all competitions for the club over the next four seasons, before joining Crewe Alexandra in July 2017. He spent the 2018\u201319 season on loan at Wrexham in the National League despite switching from Crewe to Shrewsbury Town in January 2019. Finding first-team games hard to come by in the 2019\u201320 season, he began 2020\u201321 in good form before being sidelined with a serious ankle injury.

However no move materialized and in November Clarke confirmed that Burgess would be reintegrated into the squad and become available for selection for first-team games, though said that Ben Garrity, Tom Pett, Tom Conlon, Jake Taylor and Brad Walker \"are probably ahead of him in the pecking order as things stand\".
