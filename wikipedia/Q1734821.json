He was a pioneer of modern ballroom dancing, a leading adjudicator and organiser,  a dance teacher of international renown and the author of classical ballroom dancing texts. His Ballroom Dancing is considered to be the 'Bible' of International-style ballroom dancing.\nHis dancing career started at the age of 6. In 1926 he was placed second in a World Championship of ballroom dancing, dancing with his sister. In 1932 he partnered Pat Kilpatrick, who would become his wife. In both his dancing and later his teaching he travelled all over the world.\nHe held the post of Chairman and later President of the ISTD, and was Honorary President of the International Council of Ballroom Dance. From 1932 Alex Moore issued the Alex Moore Monthly Letter Service, a periodical about ballroom dancing, with hints for dancers and instructors and news about dance championships. It was circulated in 40 countries in several languages. His 1936 Ballroom Technique book is the base of the ISTD reference for the category of International Standard. Addressing the need in quick reference, he devised the chart format of the description of ballroom dance figures, used today.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jive (dance)", "response": ["After the war, the boogie became the dominant form for popular music. It was, however, never far from criticism as a foreign, vulgar dance. Ballroom dancing guru Alex Moore said that he had \"never seen anything uglier\". In 1968 it was adopted as the fifth Latin dance in International competitions. The modern form of ballroom jive since the 1990s is a very happy and boppy dance, with frequent lifting of knees and bending or rocking of the hips."]}, {"page": "World Dance Council", "response": ["* Alex Moore (ICBD)"]}, {"page": "List of partner dance books", "response": ["*Alex Moore:", "**The Ballroom Technique, (numerous reprints and editions since 1948) originally based on a work of the same name by Alex Moore."]}, {"page": "Alex Moore", "response": ["*Alex Moore (dancer) (1901\u20131991), pioneer of modern ballroom dancing", "*Alex Moore (footballer) (1918\u20131989), Australian footballer for Collingwood", "*Alex Moore (rugby union) (born 1963), Scottish rugby player", "*Alex Moore (American football) (born 1945), American football player", "*Whistlin' Alex Moore (1899\u20131989), American blues pianist", "*Alex Moore, singer/songwriter, lead guitarist for The Lathums"]}, {"page": "List of dancers", "response": ["*Alex Moore (1901\u20131991), pioneer of modern ballroom dancing, a dancer, dance teacher and author of classical ballroom dancing books.
