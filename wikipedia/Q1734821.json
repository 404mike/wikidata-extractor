He was a pioneer of modern ballroom dancing, a leading adjudicator and organiser,  a dance teacher of international renown and the author of classical ballroom dancing texts. His Ballroom Dancing is considered to be the 'Bible' of International-style ballroom dancing.\nHis dancing career started at the age of 6. In 1926 he was placed second in a World Championship of ballroom dancing, dancing with his sister. In 1932 he partnered Pat Kilpatrick, who would become his wife. In both his dancing and later his teaching he travelled all over the world.\nHe held the post of Chairman and later President of the ISTD, and was Honorary President of the International Council of Ballroom Dance. From 1932 Alex Moore issued the Alex Moore Monthly Letter Service, a periodical about ballroom dancing, with hints for dancers and instructors and news about dance championships. It was circulated in 40 countries in several languages. His 1936 Ballroom Technique book is the base of the ISTD reference for the category of International Standard. Addressing the need in quick reference, he devised the chart format of the description of ballroom dance figures, used today.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
