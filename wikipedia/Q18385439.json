The loss of Peake also meant the loss of the fledgling company's main source of income. However, having successfully obtained official distribution rights to Dungeons & Dragons and other TSR products in the UK, and maintaining a high profile by running games conventions, the business grew rapidly. It opened its first retail shop in April 1978."]}, {"page": "Steve Jackson (British game designer)", "response": ["Steve Jackson began his career in games in 1974 as a freelance journalist with Games & Puzzles magazine. In early 1975, Jackson co-founded the company Games Workshop with school friends John Peake and Ian Livingstone. They started publishing a monthly newsletter, Owl and Weasel, which was largely written by Jackson, and sent copies of the first issue to subscribers of Albion fanzine; Brian Blume, co-partner of American publisher TSR, received one of these copies and in return sent back a copy of TSR's new game Dungeons & Dragons. Jackson and Livingstone felt that this game was more imaginative than anything being produced in the UK at the time, and so worked out an arrangement with Blume for an exclusive deal to sell D&D in Europe. In late 1975, Jackson and Livingstone organized their first convention, the first Games Day. While selling game products directly out of their flat, their landlord kicked them out in the summer of 1976 after people kept showing up there looking for an actual store. By 1978 the first Games Workshop store had opened, in London."]}, {"page": "John Peake", "response": ["*John Peake's profile at databaseOlympics", "*John Peake's profile at Sports Reference.com"]}, {"page": "Peake (surname)", "response": ["*John Peake, multiple people", ":*John Peake (born 1924), English field hockey player", ":*John Peake (game designer), British board game maker"]}, {"page": "John Peake (craftsman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Peake (game designer)"]}, {"page": "John Peake (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Peake may refer to:", "* John Peake (born 1924), English field hockey player", "* John Peake (game designer), game designer"]}]}}
