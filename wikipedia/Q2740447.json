Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at the feet of Murphy to win the ball, but in the collision Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead.Whittell, Manchester City Greats, p.\u00a021. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p.\u00a0180.", "|Half back ||5 ||Dave Ewing"]}, {"page": "1955 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|5 || Dave Ewing"]}, {"page": "1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["Manchester City started strongly, particularly Francis Lee; The Guardian correspondent wrote \"Lee, indefatigable and nigh irresistible continually embarrassed the G\u00f3rnik defence in the early stages\". Lee had the first chance of the match, a close range shot which was saved by Kostka. Manchester City took the lead in the 12th minute. Lee cut in from the left wing, escaping a tackle from Alfred Olek, and struck a fierce shot.Gardner, The Manchester City Football Book No. 2, p. 20. Goalkeeper Hubert Kostka parried the ball, only for it to land at the feet of Neil Young for a simple finish.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 66. Shortly after City defender Mike Doyle sustained an ankle injury after colliding with Stefan Florenski. Manchester City played on with ten men for a period as Doyle received treatment from trainer Dave Ewing, but the defender was unable to continue. Substitute Ian Bowyer replaced him.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p. 133. The change prompted an alteration in formation, in which Colin Bell switched to a deeper position.  Shortly before half-time, Young won the ball after loose play from Florenski, which put him clear on goal. As Young moved into the penalty area Kostka rushed out of his goal and upended him, leaving the referee no option but to give a penalty. Lee struck the spot-kick with power into the centre of the goal. Kostka's legs made contact with the ball, but the force of the shot carried it into the net to make it 2\u20130.James, The Big Book of City, p. 41 G\u00f3rnik got a goal back midway through the second half, but there were no more goals and the match finished 2\u20131."]}]}}
