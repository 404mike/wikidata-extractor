He was considered a bare-knuckle welterweight champion of England during his career, and was an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2002.", "Young Dutch Sam was born Samuel Evans on 30 January 1808  on Well Street, Ratcliffe Highway in London's East End, a handsome son of the Jewish bare-knuckle English boxing champion Samuel Elias known as Dutch Sam. His father was of fairly recent Dutch heritage.  According to a few accounts, particularly the 1904 volume, Famous Fights Past and Present,May have been illegitimate in Famous Fights Past and Present, Volume 1, no. 4, edited by Harold Furniss, London, England, 1904, pg. 186 he may well have been an illegitimate child, born out of wed-lock, though his mother, not his father's parentage was in question.  Ratcliffe Highway was considered a poorer section of London, and known for robberies in London's early nineteenth century, most notably around 1810.\"Fight Between Young Dutch Sam and Jack Martin for 100 Pounds a Side\",The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 3, 5 November 1823 In his earliest days, Young Dutch worked as a shop boy in a potato warehouse, and later as a press boy and sheet folder for the printing presses of Pierce Egan.  He was also a marker at the King's Bench Racket-ground, where he earned to play the game with science and skill, rivaling the greatest players of his era.   Most important in his youth, was Young Dutch's work for Egan, the early boxing journalist and publisher.  Evans also worked as a \"runner\" distributing  Egan's weekly newspaper Pierce Egan's Life, in London to sports fans in pubs.", "By some accounts, at least according to the boxing site Boxrec, his victory over Harry Jones, known as the \"Sailor Boy\", at Shere Mere on 18 October 1825 cemented his informal title of English or World bareknuckle welterweight champion, though no sanctioning bodies at the time could officially bestow this title.  Though questionable, the writer for the 1904 publication Famous Fights Past and Present, wrote that Sam's fight with Jones was a pre-arranged match and that Jones had decided to throw the fight.Famous Fights Past and Present, Volume 1, no. 4, edited by Harold Furniss, London, England, 1904, pg. 186  Both Jones and Sam were well known boxers at the time.  Jones appeared more muscular and likely stronger, though Young Dutch was noticeably the taller of the two competitors. The match was fought in the rain, and the well known bare-knuckle boxer Dick Curtis was Young Dutch's second.  In the tenth round Jones caught Sam around the neck and threw him to the ground.  This tactic, known as fibbing, would be illegal using today's Marquess of Queensbury rules.  The last blow in the 18th round was a right to the jaw, which ended the match in 53 minutes, as Jones did not wish to continue when his seconds attempted to lift him. The reporter for London's Morning Chronicle wrote that Jones showed less aggression in the final rounds, where Young Dutch Sam took the lead in the fighting.  Tellingly, Jones was frequently down which ended rounds thirteen through fifteen.\"Boxing, Fight Between Young Dutch Sam and Jones\", The Morning Post, London, England, pg. 3, 19 October 1825 The purse was set for \u00a325 a side, a considerable sum, for an early career match.\"Young Dutch Sam and Jones\", Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 3, 19 October 1825", "In a bout with Tom \"Gypsey\" Cooper in Gravesend in Essex close to the Thames on 25 April 1826, Sam was a clear winner in an eighteen round bout according to the Boxing Register, though London's Morning Post listed the match as lasting 5 rounds. The more detailed London Morning Chronicle listed the action in 15 rounds, a far more accurate tally.  Sam was the favorite in the betting at 2-1, for an early career purse of \u00a330 a side.  Gypsey Cooper was the brother of Jack Cooper who attended him at the match.  Sam took a clear lead, landing a right and left to Gypsey's mouth in the first that floored him, and floored Cooper again with a right and left at the end of the third.  In the sixth, Sam showed his ability to rush away from the blows of his opponents, as he had in earlier rounds.  In the tenth through the fifteenth Sam dominated, badly punishing his opponent.Five rounds for \u00a330 in \"Boxing, Dutch Sam and Gypsey Cooper\", The Morning Post,  London, England, pg. 3, 26 April 1826  Sam's habit of drawing his man to him, and then taking advantage of the closeness to punch with accuracy echoed the scientific boxing style of his primary mentor Dick Curtis.  Gypsey Cooper, though a stouter and somewhat more muscular opponent, left his head unguarded during his mad rushes which gave Young Dutch the opportunity to frequently connect with blows to this vital spot.\"Fight Between Young Dutch Sam and Tom Cooper, Remarks\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 26 April 1826", "In one of his best remembered bouts on 19 June 1827, it took 30 rounds requiring a time of 3 hours and 35 minutes to defeat Dick Davis at Haversham, England.  The purse of \u00a350 a side was considerable but would increase in subsequent fights.  Davis was not a widely known boxer and lost decisively to Young Dutch, who by the end of the bout had done considerable damage to Davis's eyes and face, peppering him with blows.  Sam fought cautiously, nearly always inflicting damage, but taking his time and retreating effectively when necessary.  Though Davis was determined to continue the bout, in the late rounds his handler could not induce him to get close to Young Dutch, and he received the worst of the exchanges without getting inside his opponent.\"Young Dutch Sam and Dick Davis\", The Morning Post, London, England, pg. 3, 21 June 1827", "On 4 November 1828, Young Dutch Sam defeated Jack Martin in seven rounds taking sixteen minutes on Knowle Hill, fifty miles Southeast of London, on Berks, near Maidenhead, for the impressive purse of \u00a3100 a side.   Dutch Sam had taken a commanding lead in the fighting by the second through sixth rounds, and when the seventh came, the fight ended.  In the sixth, Young Dutch floored Martin with a right to the cheek, one of the strongest blows in the match, and the first clear knockdown caused by a blow in the match.  The London Morning News wrote that Young Dutch was not as fit and fast as in his earliest days, as Martin was  32 years of age during their bout, while Young Dutch was only 21.  Apparently even three years of bare-knuckle fighting had begun to take its toll on Young Dutch Sam.  Oddly, the early betting favored Martin at 6-4.", "upright=.8|left|thumb|Young Dutch Sam and Ned Neale", "Young Dutch Sam defeated Ned Neale on 7 April 1829 in 78 rounds, lasting around 1 hour 41 minutes,\"Column 2, Boxing\", Jackson's Oxford Journal, Oxford, England, pg. 2, 11 April 1829  in Ludlow, England, though the attendance at the fight was not great as Ludow was over 100 miles from London.  Young Dutch fought at around 154 pounds or 11 stone, still near the modern welterweight range which ends at 160.  The boxers met for a considerable purse of \u00a3100 which was collected by subscription from the townspeople.  London's Morning Chronicle wrote that Young Dutch had never been defeated, and that Neale had lost only once in a boxing competition.  At the end of the match, it was noted that Sam appeared to be a more scientific boxer, with greater speed and skill.  From the 66th to the final round, it was clear that Sam had a defining lead, and it was noted that Neale landed on the ground to end the round quickly in many rounds, a factor that shortened the length of rounds and the duration of the match.  By the fight's end, Neale was functionally blinded by the swelling of his eyes and required the intervention of a doctor, and though Sam was able to walk to his coach with difficulty, the damage to the left side of his face and head was considerable.  Many believed that Ned's loss of weight to make the pre-fight weigh-in cost him in physical endurance and was a factor in his poor performance in the late rounds.\"Game Fight Between Ned Neal and Young Dutch Sam in Ludow for \u00a3100\", Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 9 April 1829", "upright=.8|right|thumb|Young Dutch Sam and Tom Gaynor;Sam lands a left", "On 24 June 1834, Sam was present in Andover at Hurstbourne Common before an impressive audience of nearly 10,000 in a particularly brutal fight of Owen Swift's lasting seventy-three rounds.  The bout tragically resulted in the death of Swift's opponent Anthony Noon.  Upon Noon's death, a warrant was issued for the apprehension of Young Dutch Sam on 26 June 1834.  Immediately prior to the fight between Noon and Swift on 24 June 1834, Young Dutch had defeated a boxer named Tom Gaynor in seventeen rounds in two hours and five minutes.\"The Prizefights Near Andover\", The Observer, London, England, pg 4. 29 June 1834   Young Dutch administered his strongest blows with his left hand, as according to London's Morning Chronicle, he had injured his right hand in the second round.

At the time of the assault, he was in the company of Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford, also known as Lord Waldegrave and occasionally titled \"The Mad Marquis\", and the two were under the influence of alcohol. Lord Waldegrave, though not arrested at the time, was fined 5 pounds, and detained for attempting to obstinately rescue Sam from the policeman. The imprisonment led to a substantial decline in Sam's health.3rd Marquess of Waterford in \"Lord Waldegrave and Young Dutch Sam\", Leiscester Chronicle, Leicester, England, pg. 4, 24 Feb 1838\"Young Dutch Sam and The Morning Star Marquis\", The Charter, London, England, pg. 9, 7 April 1839", "In 1840, Young Dutch Sam's residence was used to finalize the financial arrangements as specified by contract for the English championship fight between Ben Caunt and Nick Ward.\"The Championship of England\", The Morning Post, London, England, pg. 4, 16 December 1840", "Young Dutch Sam died at the age of 35 in 1843 after retiring from boxing around 1834.

Several reliable accounts state that Sam left a widow but no children.He left a widow in \"Death of Young Dutch Sam\", The Newcastle Weekly Courant, Tyne and Wear, England, pg. 8, 10 November 1843.

The early betting favored Baldwin 2-1.  In the 9th, he floored Sam with a terrific blow to the temple, improving the already superior odds on his winning to 4-1, but tired in the later rounds.  By the 20th, the tide turned, and the younger Sam struck with uppercuts wreaking havoc on the face of Baldwin.   The uppercut was considered Sam's signature punch, a blow he was credited with introducing to in the ring, and his right uppercut was considered particularly powerful.  The fight was stopped in Sam's favor after thirty-seven rounds of hard fighting, and Sam's uppercuts proved so devastating that Baldwin had to be carried from the ring.
