His mother was a member at Pen-y-Garn, the Calvinistic Methodist church at Rhydypennau while his father attended Bethel Independent church at Tal-y-bont. William Williams was a lead miner and due to lack of work in the local industry he went to work for some time in 1879-80 at the collieries in Mountain Ash. In 1882 the whole family settled in Penrhiwceibr in the Aberdare valley where they became members at Carmel chapel. Shortly afterwards they moved to Ynysybwl and joined Tabernacle, where the young Williams began preaching while working as a miner."]}, {"page": "1919 in Wales", "response": ["*National Eisteddfod of Wales: Crown \u2013 William Williams (Crwys)"]}, {"page": "Crwys", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Williams (Crwys)"]}, {"page": "1875 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 January \u2013 William Williams, Welsh poet and Archdruid (died 1968)"]}, {"page": "1875 in Wales", "response": ["*4 January \u2013 William Williams (Crwys), poet and Archdruid (died 1968)"]}, {"page": "William Crwys Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Williams (Crwys)"]}, {"page": "2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony", "response": ["| Tune Cwm Rhondda by John Hughes  Lyrics: William Williams  Arr.
