In the show's fifth season finale, a special appearance from Napalm Death's Mark \"Barney\" Greenway featured a scene in which he and Rich have a heart-to-heart. Regarding the band's appearance, Barney stated, \"One thing that bothers me about TV is the way that teenagers are portrayed. It's down to the f--king Daily Mail's war on teenagers. They stigmatize young kids and it's bulls--t. The thing I like about 'Skins' is it gives a genuine perspective on growing up. That's why we agreed to do this show.\""]}, {"page": "Alex Arnold", "response": ["* Alex Arnold (footballer) (born 1928), former Scottish footballer"]}]}}
