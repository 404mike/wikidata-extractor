His father, also William Adams Brodribb, was an attorney who was convicted of administering unlawful oaths in 1816 and transported for seven years. He arrived at Sydney in Sir William Bensley in March 1817, and was sent to Hobart. In February 1818 his wife and children arrived at Hobart in Duke of Wellington. They settled on a farm near New Norfolk and three more sons were born.\nIn April 1835 William junior moved to New South Wales and became a partner in a cattle station. In 1836 he overlanded the second draft of cattle to Melbourne.  On returning from Port Phillip Brodribb relocated to what later became the site of Gundagai.  In August Brodribb  petitioned for a punt over the Murrumbidgee near his Gundagai hut and in January 1838 Deputy Surveyor General Samuel Perry reported that 'a better site could not have been chosen for a Town of the first class' in reference to Gundagai. In 1841, following Strzelecki, he formed an expedition to Gippsland which named Port Albert, the Latrobe River, the Albert River and explored inland.\nIn 1843 he became manager of the Monaro runs of William Bradley. For the next twelve years he lived on Coolringdon station near Cooma.  In 1855 he settled on the Wanganella run, near Deniliquin.  He owned a series of properties in western New South Wales until retiring to Sydney in 1879.\nAt the 1859 election he was a candidate for the seat Balranald in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, but was unsuccessful. In July 1861 Brodribb won the seat of Brighton in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, but resigned the following year. His brother Kenric was also a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing St Kilda from 1861 to 1864.
