While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg, Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen. The show focused on the men's interaction with Clegg's new neighbour, Howard (Kenneth Waller), and his wife, Pearl, played by a local actress. The first act built up to the appearance of Marina (Jean Fergusson), who was in correspondence with Howard. At the end of the first act, Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot.Bright and Ross (2000), pp.\u00a025\u201326 Howard and Marina's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television show. In the first series, the librarian, Mr. Wainwright, was having a love affair with his married assistant, Mrs. Partridge. Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret, especially from Mrs. Partridge's husband, the trio of old men were well aware of the affair. The summer season reversed the roles: Howard became the married partner, and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife."]}, {"page": "Are You Being Served?", "response": ["* \"Old\" Mr Grace (Kenneth Waller) (series 8), \"Young\" Mr Grace's even-older brother\u00a0\u2013 replaced him at the store when he took a sabbatical to write his memoirs.

When the family arrive at the Police Station to collect him, Nellie refers to Freddie as Grandad's son-in-law for the only time, confirming that he is, in fact, her own father. In later series we are told Grandad's name is William Duval and Nellie refers to her maiden name of Duval. This confirms that Grandad was Nellie's father. He appeared in all seven series and was in the last episode's final scene, alongside Jean Boht.

Both were old but loved young, curvaceous women. They both treated their employees with respect and encouragement, hence Young Mr Grace's catch phrase, \"You've all done very well!\" However, they were terminally naive to the fact that Grace Brothers was in its declining years. Despite the wealth of the family, they were somewhat stingy with money and paid their workers terribly, causing many strikes, disagreements and disruptions. Young Mr Grace started off as a fish salesman before inheriting the store from an uncle in 1926. Old Mr Grace remained an unseen character until series eight, and there was a recurring joke for many years in which, upon seeing Young Mr Grace for the first time, someone would ask in surprise, \"That's Young Mr Grace?\" The other person always replied, \"Old Mr Grace doesn't get about much these days.\" Ironically, when he finally did appear in the show, Kenneth Waller (as Old Mr Grace) twenty-eight years younger than Harold Bennett (as Young Mr Grace), and thus the character was in much better condition both mentally and physically. It was revealed that Young Mr Grace had a wife who died in 1935. Young Mr Grace's age was a mystery. In 1976, it was said he was 80, yet in 1977, it was said he was born in 1897, and his 80th birthday was celebrated in that episode. In 1978, it was said that it was his 80th birthday then. Old Mr Grace was born in 1891, and celebrated his 90th birthday in 1981.
