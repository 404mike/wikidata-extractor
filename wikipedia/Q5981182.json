Many stage works of this period cry out for filmic extension\u2014in fact, Medak had just filmed a very different play that mingled fantasy and reality by a writer often bracketed with Barnes, Peter Nichols\u2019 A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. But what makes The Ruling Class exceptional (and difficult for some) are its outrageous mixing of genres and its sheer ambition. Not only are there allusions to Shakespeare and Marlowe, but also to Wilde and Whitehall farce; to the gentility of Ealing Studios, with a plot that distantly evokes that other great black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets, and to Hammer's gore-fests.\"", "*The Ruling Class an essay by Ian Christie at the Criterion Collection"]}, {"page": "Michael Powell", "response": ["* 1994: (with Emeric Pressburger and Ian Christie) The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp.

Powell noted ruefully in his autobiography, \"I make a film that nobody wants to see and then, thirty years later, everybody has either seen it or wants to see it.\" An account of the film's steady reappraisal can be found in Scorsese on Scorsese, edited by Ian Christie and David Thompson. Martin Scorsese mentions that he first heard of the film as a film student in the early 1960s, when Peeping Tom opened in only one theatre in Alphabet City, which, Scorsese notes, was a seedy district of New York. The film was released in a cut black-and-white print but immediately became a cult fascination among Scorsese's generation. Scorsese states that the film, in this mutilated form, influenced Jim McBride's David Holzman's Diary. Scorsese himself first saw the film in 1970 through a friend who owned an uncut 35mm colour print. In 1978, Scorsese was approached by a New York distributor, Corinth Films, which asked for $5,000 for a wider re-release. Scorsese gladly complied with their request, which allowed the film to reach a wider audience than its initial cult following.

Ian Christie in the Daily Express excoriated the film, saying that the plot was \"absurd but fundamentally dull\", a further problem being that as \"there isn't a coherent storyline to link [the stunts], they eventually become tiresome.\""]}, {"page": "Never Say Never Again", "response": ["Never Say Never Again was broadly welcomed and praised by the critics: Ian Christie, writing in the Daily Express, said that Never Say Never Again was \"one of the better Bonds\", finding the film \"superbly witty and entertaining,\u00a0... the dialogue is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative\". Christie also thought that \"Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero\". David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: \"Connery\u00a0... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way\". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo \"very nearly make it all worthwhile.\" The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying \"The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff.\""]}, {"page": "A Matter of Life and Death (film)", "response": ["Ian Christie wrote, \"the chess plot may also be of more significance than at first appears. The Conductor tries to tempt Peter by offering him the opportunity to pit his skill against the great chess masters; and he 'borrows' Alekhine's famous book, only to return it in an extraordinary transitional shot which introduces the final sequence of Peter waking up in hospital. As a token of Peter's life, the book tumbles from one photographic world to another within the same shot\".

YouTube has \"become a hugely successful aggregator of ephemeral media\". In 2009, Ian Christie considered that a substantial amount of modern media, aligned with \"rapid proliferati[on]\", \"may prove much more ephemeral than the flip-book\".
