Giblin is an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Liverpool where he has served on staff for more than 40 years. His positions at Liverpool have included Head of Department (of mathematical sciences), and Head of Division (of pure mathematics).\nHe is the author or co-author of eight published books, some of which have been translated into Russian. The foreword for the Russian translation of his book Curves and Singularities was written by V. I. Arnold. Giblin has also authored or co-authored over a hundred peer reviewed published articles. The first of these was published in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Giblin, peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Giblin"]}, {"page": "P. J.
