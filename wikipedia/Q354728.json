He rejected sacred magic (miracles) under Church auspices and looked for cures in nature. He preached but he also pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine. His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man (microcosm) and Nature (macrocosm). He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.Charles Webster, Paracelsus: Medicine, Magic, and Mission at the End of Time (Yale Univ.

Paracelsus is a highly controversial figure in the history of medicine, with most experts hailing him as a Father of Modern Medicine for shaking off religious orthodoxy and inspiring many researchers; others say he was a mystic more than a scientist and downplay his importance.Roy Porter, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind (1997), 201\u201311", "Across Europe medical schools relied primarily on lectures and readings.

In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced including inducing seizures (by electroshock, insulin or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart (leucotomy or lobotomy).

Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.Roy Porter, The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment (2000), pp. 1\u201312, 482\u201384.", "Enlightenment historiography began in the period itself, from what Enlightenment figures said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took. D'Alembert's Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclop\u00e9die provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge \u2013 of which the Encyclop\u00e9die forms the pinnacle.Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Discours pr\u00e9liminaire de l'Encyclop\u00e9die In 1783, Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason.Outram, 1. The past tense is used deliberately as whether man would educate himself or be educated by certain exemplary figures was a common issue at the time. D'Alembert's introduction to l'Encyclop\u00e9die, for example, along with Immanuel Kant's essay response (the \"independent thinkers\"), both support the later model. Immanuel Kant called Enlightenment \"man's release from his self-incurred tutelage\", tutelage being \"man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another\".Immanuel Kant, \"What is Enlightenment?\", 1. \"For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance\". The German scholar Ernst Cassirer called the Enlightenment \"a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness\".Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of the Enlightenment, (1951), p. vi According to historian Roy Porter, the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance, is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture."]}, {"page": "Christ's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Roy Porter"]}, {"page": "Lobotomy", "response": ["The clinician-historian Joel Braslow argues that from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, physical psychiatric therapies \"spiral closer and closer to the interior of the brain\" with this organ increasingly taking \"center stage as a source of disease and site of cure\". For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, were at least deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate last resort remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless.;  Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights."]}, {"page": "Miracle", "response": ["* Roy Porter The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity, W.W.
