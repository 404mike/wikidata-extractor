The show was first broadcast on the BBC on 14 June 1958. It developed into a regular 45-minute show on Saturday evening prime time television, featuring a sing-along format with both solo and minstrel pieces (often with extended segueing), some country and western and music derived from other foreign folk cultures. The male minstrels performed in blackface; the female dancers and other supporting artists did not. The show included \"comedy interludes\" performed by Leslie Crowther, George Chisholm and Stan Stennett. It was initially produced by George Inns with George Mitchell. The minstrels' main soloists were baritone Dai Francis, tenor John Boulter, and bass Tony Mercer.Television Heaven  During the nine years that the show was broadcast in black and white, the blackface makeup was actually red, as black did not register as well."]}, {"page": "Television Wales and the West", "response": ["Much of the station's closing night was made up of in-house produced output including Live Like A Lord (a music and comedy show with mainstay TWW personality Ivor Emmanuel and Clive Dunn), teenybopper music show Discs a Go-Go (with future Radio Caroline/United DJs presenter Tony Prince) and Sing Me A Fantasy (a musical film).

This was especially the case with writing - he had completed and published a novel, Mr Lonely, while convalescing after his operation, and had written two children's books, The Reluctant Vampire and The Vampire's Revenge. During the beginning of 1984 he was completing a book about one of his other passions, fishing, and was in the process of writing a second adult novel.
