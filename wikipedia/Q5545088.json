In 1836 he compiled a guide to The Lakes of England illustrated with forty-three charming line drawings, and he showed skill as an architect by building various stables and kennels, including the Tattersall stud stables at Willesden. His experience in this and similar undertakings led him to publish Sporting Architecture (1841).In the same year, under the pseudonym \"Wildrake,\" he published Cracks of the Day, describing and illustrating sixty-five racehorses. He also contributed illustrations to the Hunting Reminiscences of Nimrod (Charles J. Apperley), the Book of Sports (1843), and the New Sporting Almanack.
