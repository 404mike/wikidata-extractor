In 1836 he compiled a guide to The Lakes of England illustrated with forty-three charming line drawings, and he showed skill as an architect by building various stables and kennels, including the Tattersall stud stables at Willesden. His experience in this and similar undertakings led him to publish Sporting Architecture (1841).In the same year, under the pseudonym \"Wildrake,\" he published Cracks of the Day, describing and illustrating sixty-five racehorses. He also contributed illustrations to the Hunting Reminiscences of Nimrod (Charles J. Apperley), the Book of Sports (1843), and the New Sporting Almanack. He was for a brief period the editor of the Almanack and Sporting Magazine.Shortly after a visit to the United States he married, in 1837, Helen Pritchard; they had four children. He died of brain fever at his home in Cadogan Place, London and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tattersalls", "response": ["*George Tattersall (1817\u20131849), a son of the second Richard Tattersall, who was a well-known sporting artist."]}, {"page": "Sir Hercules", "response": ["Weatherby sent him to stand at stud at George Tattersall's stud, Dawley Wall Farm.

In 1844, Herbert sent the stallion to Tattersall's Willesden Paddocks, where he was available to public mares. Soon, however, Herbert broke up his stud and sold Sir Hercules to Mr. Phillips of Bushbury Stud, where the stallion eventually died at the age of thirty."]}, {"page": "Tattersall", "response": ["* George Tattersall (1817\u20131849), English sporting artist"]}, {"page": "Army and Navy Club", "response": ["It was reported in January 1847 that the club would hold an open competition for the design of its planned new building, with prizes of \u00a3200 and \u00a3100 for the two best entrants.The Builder, 9 January 1847, p. 18 The club committee initially chose a design by the sporting artist George Tattersall, of St James's Street, who planned a two-storey classical building with Corinthian columns and a crowning balustrade ending with martial trophies and a Doric entrance portico of three bays. As well as various statues in niches, over the portico he drew a pedestal with bas-reliefs, surmounted by lions and a group symbolising Britannia and Neptune. This choice was confirmed by a ballot of the club members in April 1847. However, The Builder pilloried the choice, pointing out that \"the space devoted to the purposes of the club is very meagre, indeed quite insufficient\".The Builder, 1 May 1847, p. 205, and 8 May 1847, pp. 213\u201315 The club held an extraordinary general meeting on 11 May 1847 and decided to buy another house in Pall Mall to make its site larger, and also to hold another competition.
