The album was called a \"treat for any Cole fan\" by Andy Kellman of AllMusic, who drew attention to how it sounds like it was recorded at a \"leisurely pace\". Continuing this thought, Kellman noted that Cole was \"breez[ing] through an easygoing set of covers\". The BBC's Chris Rogers defined the album as \"an ultra smooth mix of standards both tasteful and obtuse\". Jay S. Jacobs of PopEntertainment.com compared Leavin'  to Cole's 1999 release, Snowfall on the Sahara, and viewed it as \"jazzy but decidedly more modern and surprisingly strong\". People's Ralph Novak, Chuck Arnold, V. R. Peterson, and Monica Rizzo commended Cole's decision to \"ditch the evening-gown fare on her new CD\" by recording more contemporary songs. Gugu Mkhabela from News24 awarded the album three out of five stars, describing the material as \"pure old school with a modern twist\", with Cole providing \"a touch of class and some depth to boot\"."]}, {"page": "Scala Radio", "response": ["* Chris Rogers"]}]}}
