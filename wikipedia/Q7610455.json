Salter is also a proponent of geoengineering and is responsible for creating the concept of the mechanical enhancement of clouds to achieve cloud reflectivity enhancement.The wide tank at the University of Edinburgh\u2014a novel design and invention by Salter, built in 1977\u2014was the world's first multi-directional wave tank equipped with absorbing wavemakers. Feedback control systems on the wavemaking flaps were used for the absorption of reflected waves, propagating along the water surface of the tank interior towards the 89 flaps.Salter is a Specialist Advisor at wave energy company Aquamarine Power advising on the development of the Oyster wave energy converter.Salter was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to engineering. In 2012 he received the Royal Academy of Engineering Sustained Achievement Award.Salter \"has been one of the leading voices\" of the marine cloud brightening movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of inventions named after people", "response": ["* Salter's duck \u2013 Stephen Salter"]}, {"page": "1974 in science", "response": ["* Stephen Salter invents the \"Salter Duck\", a wave energy converter."]}, {"page": "Wave power", "response": ["A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the oil crisis in 1973.

Their goal was to make clouds more reflective to bounce more of the Sun's heat generating rays back into space as a stop-gap against global warming. By changing the size of water droplets within a cloud, they make clouds brighter and reflect the Sun's heat into space. They choose to seed marine stratocumulus clouds because of their commonality around the world and the fact that they are low-lying, making it easier for man-made droplets to reach them. The Project Earth team uses the potassium chloride and sodium chloride from (salt-based) flares to form droplet particles that are one micrometre in diameter, and that can rise to , even in adverse (cloudless) conditions. The experiment proves that man-made droplets can indeed seed stratocumulus clouds."]}, {"page": "Jeff Goodell", "response": ["In 2010 he published How to Cool the Planet: Geoengineering and the Audacious Quest to Fix Earth\u2019s Climate\"Can We 'Cool the Planet' through Geoengineering?\", NPR interview on Fresh Air, April 15, 2010 about geoengineering, global warming, and climate change mitigation.

The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray would change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter. The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth. The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect."]}, {"page": "Marine cloud brightening", "response": ["In the earliest published studies, John Latham and Stephen Salter proposed a fleet of around 1500 unmanned Rotor ships, or Flettner ships, that would spray mist created from seawater into the air.  The vessels would spray sea water droplets at a rate of approximately 50 cubic meters per second over a large portion of Earth's ocean surface. The power for the rotors and the ship could be generated from underwater turbines. Salter and colleagues proposed using active hydro foils with controlled pitch for power.[1]"]}, {"page": "Salter's duck", "response": ["Salter's duck, also known as the nodding duck or by its official name the Edinburgh duck, is a device that converts wave power into electricity. The wave impact induces rotation of gyroscopes located inside a pear-shaped \"duck\", and an electrical generator converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90%. The Salter's duck was invented by Stephen Salter in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s and was one of the earliest generator designs proposed to the Wave Energy programme in the United Kingdom. The funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the UK government moved away from alternative energy sources.
