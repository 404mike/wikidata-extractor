Interested in the theatre too, he wrote for the magazine Encore, which existed for a decade (1954 to 1965).\nMilne wrote for Sight & Sound, the Monthly Film Bulletin, The Observer and The Times during his career. During the 1960s he was associate editor of Sight & Sound and editor of the Monthly Film Bulletin. His book length studies of film directors include monographs on Joseph Losey (1968) and Rouben Mamoulian (1969) in the Thames & Hudson Cinema One series, the former comprising a series of extended interviews with the director. He also wrote a short study on the Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer (1971) and edited and translated an anthology of interviews and writings on Jean-Luc Godard (1972).In addition, Tom Milne oversaw the translation and subtitling of French films for television screenings. He was the founding editor of the Time Out Film Guide, which went through nineteen editions from 1989 through 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Author Aaron Sultanik observed that in Sellers's early films, such as I'm All Right Jack, he displays \"deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization\", which \"...\u00a0reduces each of his characters to a series of gross, awkward tics\". Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers's external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers's work was \"true\" acting. Critic Tom Milne saw a change over Sellers's career and thought that his \"comic genius as a character actor was\u00a0... stifled by his elevation to leading man\" and his later films suffered as a result. Sultanik agreed, commenting that Sellers's \"exceptional vocal and physical technique\" was under-used during his career in the US."]}, {"page": "Richard Burton", "response": ["In 1968, Burton enjoyed a commercial blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; he received a $1\u00a0million fee plus a share of the film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, \u201cHe did that one for us kids, because we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?\" Eastwood  thought the script \"terrible\" and was \"all exposition and complications\". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking \"I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue.\" Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he \"did all the talking and [Eastwood] did all the killing\". Burton's last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which he was paid $1.25\u00a0million, () was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that Burton \"plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity\". Conversely, Vincent Canby of The New York Times appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he \"is in excellent form and voice\u2014funny, loutish and sometimes wise\". Anne of the Thousand Days received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, Staircase in which he and his Cleopatra co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful."]}, {"page": "Rocky III", "response": ["Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"Sorry to say this, but there's not anything new in Rocky III, and we sit there wondering why it exists.\" He added that \"we see nothing new about Rocky's character, except that the tender side of his soul, which made him so appealing, is now virtually missing.

In Sight and Sound, Tom Milne said the film was well-constructed and had good characterisation, but lacked the mystery and charisma of the earlier American crime films it attempted to emulate.

'Claudine' is a first-rate American comedy that gives stature to a popular form. The difference between it and dozens of television comedies is the difference between interests, to say nothing of talents.

Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, calling it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\". Ebert wrote, \"In the two hours of this film that I saw, there were no scenes of joy, natural pleasure, or good sensual cheer. There was, instead, a nauseating excursion into base and sad fantasies.\" It is also notable for being one of the few films Ebert ever walked out of\u2014he walked out 2 hours into its 170-minute length after feeling \"disgusted and unspeakably depressed\". He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their \"dogs of the year\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews.

Jay Scott, reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail, said, \"Caligula doesn't really work on any level\".Jay Scott, The Globe and Mail, February 7, 1980. Scott unfavourably compared Caligula with In the Realm of the Senses, describing the latter film as a better treatment of extreme sexuality. Scott's review went on to say \"Rome would seem to be at least as fecund a territory for the cinematic exploration of sex, death and money, as pre-war Japan ... but what's missing from Caligula, which is rife with all three, is any connective tissue (also any point of view, any thought, any meaning)\". Scott concluded his review by claiming the whole film's production was \"a boondoggle of landmark proportions\". New York critic David Denby described the film as \"an infinitely degraded version of Fellini Satyricon.\" Tom Milne (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the film was \"by no means so awesomely bad as most critics have been pleased to report\u2014but pretty bad all the same\" and found the film to be \"notable chiefly for the accuracy with which it reflects this anonymity.\""]}, {"page": "Seven Days in May", "response": ["British references also show high regard for the film, with TimeOut Film Guide's founding editor Tom Milne indicating that \"conspiracy movies may have become more darkly complex in these post-Watergate days of Pakula and paranoia, but Frankenheimer's fascination with gadgetry (in his compositions, the ubiquitous helicopters, TV screens, hidden cameras and electronic devices literally edge the human characters into insignificance) is used to create a striking visual metaphor for control by the military machine.

Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded his highest grade of four stars and called it \"some kind of bizarre masterpiece,\" concluding that \"'Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia' is Sam Peckinpah making movies flat out, giving us a desperate character he clearly loves, and asking us to somehow see past the horror and the blood to the sad poem he's trying to write about the human condition.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that although Peckinpah's films were noted for their violence, \"What Peckinpah does much better, and what distinguishes his film The Ballad of Cable Hogue as his best work, is to portray a lyrical mood between society's outcasts. A hooker and a prospector hook up in 'Cable Hogue,' the pairing of Bennie and Elita in 'Alfredo Garcia' is equally affecting.
