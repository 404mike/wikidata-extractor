It often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475 CE. In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut and fuck off.\nFuck is considered offensive and vulgar. In the United States, fuck is often removed from music broadcast over radio. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that usage of fuck is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments. Instances of public figures such as politicians using fuck often gain significant attention.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John le Fucker", "response": ["* Roger Fuckebythenavele"]}, {"page": "Paul Booth (historian)", "response": ["In 2015 Booth was in the news when he discovered the apparent first known use of a now commonly used expletive, within the name of one Roger Fuckebythenavele, in the plea rolls of the Chester County Court for the years 1310\u20131311."]}]}}
