In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third \u2014 Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup \u2014 were in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to remain in the competition. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished."]}, {"page": "Dancing with the Stars", "response": ["Series 6, 2008: Tom Chambers & Camilla Dallerup"]}, {"page": "Tubridy Tonight", "response": ["| 10 January 2009 || Tom Chambers, Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli (Strictly Come Dancing), Mark Hamilton, Amanda Brunker, Duncan Bannatyne (Dragons' Den) ||  ||  || Details "]}, {"page": "Gethin Jones", "response": ["Jones was one of the celebrities who took part in the Strictly Come Dancing: The Live Tour! 2009.
