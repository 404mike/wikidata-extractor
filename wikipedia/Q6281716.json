In 1772 he became minister of King Edward Street Chapel, Macclesfield. There was an orthodox secession from his ministry; he consequently resigned in 1779, and moved to Birmingham without regular charge, being in independent circumstances. At Birmingham he renewed his acquaintance with Priestley, and was a member of a fortnightly clerical club which arranged the material for the Theological Repository. In 1782 Priestley recommended him, but without effect, as colleague to Joseph Bretland at Exeter."]}, {"page": "John Cameron (Reformed Presbyterian)", "response": ["He wrote anonymously several works (some in the form of dialogues) attacking from various points of view the principle of subscription to creeds. The authorship was no secret; but the extent of Cameron's doctrinal divergence from the standards of his church was not publicly revealed till nearly thirty years after his death. A paper rejecting the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was forwarded by Cameron to Archdeacon Francis Blackburne, in expectation of a reply. Blackburne sent the paper to Joseph Priestley, who published it in his Theological Repository, vol. ii. 1771, with the signature of \"Philander\" (\"Philander\", in later volumes, is one of the many signatures of Joseph Bretland). It led to a correspondence between Priestley and Cameron, and to the settlement of Cameron's son William, as a button-maker in Birmingham."]}, {"page": "Timothy Kenrick", "response": ["In 1798 Kenrick declined an invitation to the divinity chair in the Manchester Academy. In the summer of 1799 he opened a dissenting academy at Exeter, with Joseph Bretland. He followed the Daventry model, and used a library formed for the academy run (1690\u20131720) by Joseph Hallett II, and revived (1760\u201371) under Samuel Merivale. In Kenrick's academy, which closed on 25 March 1805, eleven students, including James Hews Bransby, received the whole, and four others, including Kenrick's eldest son, a part of their training."]}, {"page": "Bretland, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Bretland"]}]}}
