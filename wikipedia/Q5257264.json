The musical show was made by TWW (Television Wales and the West) in Cardiff\u2019s Pontcanna studios, and was designed to celebrate Wales within Wales and beyond.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["**Denis Griffiths, tenor (d. 2001)"]}, {"page": "Gwlad y G\u00e2n", "response": ["In addition, around five members of the BBC Octet (\"BBC Welsh Singers\") were drafted in to provide a disciplined musical core. Cliff Bunford, himself a talented tenor, was one of them, as was his fellow octet tenor Denis Griffiths. Along with them came baritone Bryn Williams and sopranos Esme Lewis and Ann Davies. This group was supplemented by additional altos, one of whom was Madelaine Rees, and some extra tenors, including Maldwyn Phillips. Whitehead added basses John Williams and a \u2018rough-looking\u2019 singer from the Rhondda called Harry Price whose big bass voice and \u2018working class\u2019 looks made him ideal for drinking and tavern scenes and other light-hearted scenarios. Altogether, the adult chorus was sixteen strong, consisting of eight male and eight female voices.", "For many of the set-piece scenes, Ivor Emmanuel was accompanied by a quartet of male singers drawn from the adult chorus. Most often these were tenor Denis Griffiths, baritone Bryn Williams, and basses John Williams and Harry Price. This line-up grew into a favourite grouping that producer Chris Mercer was happy to repeat over and over again.", "Regular solo spots were also given to Sian Hopkins, a member of the Canton contingent in the Children's Chorus. Aged about 13 or 14 in 1958, and with a clear sweet soprano voice, Hopkins quickly became a favourite young soloist on Land of Song. She was also paired in duets with Denis Griffiths, who was himself an occasional soloist. Other featured Welsh singers included the soprano Marion Davies.Marion Davies appears, singing an Osborne Roberts song of lost love, in the ten minutes of Land of Song footage that survives in the TWW archive now owned by HTV."]}, {"page": "RiverPines Golf", "response": ["RiverPines Golf opened in the fall of 1990 as a 9 hole par 3 course and driving range.
