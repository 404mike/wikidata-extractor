With innovative use of statistics in biology, he was one of the founders of neo-Darwinism. He served in the Great War, and obtained the rank of captain. Despite his lack of an academic degree in the field,  he taught biology at the University of Cambridge, the Royal Institution, and University College London. Renouncing his British citizenship, he became an Indian citizen and worked at the Indian Statistical Institute for the rest of his life.  \nHaldane's article on abiogenesis in 1929 introduced the \"primordial soup theory\", which became the foundation for the concept of the chemical origin of life. He established human gene maps for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome, and codified Haldane's rule on sterility in the heterogametic sex of hybrids in species. He correctly proposed that sickle-cell disease confers some immunity to malaria. He was the first to suggest the central idea of in vitro fertilisation, as well as concepts such as hydrogen economy, cis and trans-acting regulation, coupling reaction, molecular repulsion, the darwin (as a unit of evolution) and organismal cloning. \nIn 1957 he articulated Haldane's dilemma, a limit on the speed of beneficial evolution which subsequently proved incorrect. He willed his body for medical studies, as he wanted to remain useful even in death. He is also remembered for coining the words \"clone\" and \"cloning\" in human biology, and \"ectogenesis\". With his sister, Naomi Mitchison, Haldane was the first to demonstrate genetic linkage in mammals. Subsequent works established a unification of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution by natural selection whilst laying the groundwork for modern evolutionary synthesis and thus helped to create population genetics.\nHaldane was a professed socialist, Marxist, atheist and humanist whose political dissent led him to leave England in 1956 and live in India, becoming a naturalised Indian citizen in 1961. \nArthur C. Clarke credited him as \"perhaps the most brilliant science populariser of his generation\". Nobel laureate Peter Medawar called Haldane \"the cleverest man I ever knew\". According to Theodosius Dobzhansky, \"Haldane was always recognized as a singular case\"; Ernst Mayr described him as a \"polymath\"; Michael J. D. White as \"the most erudite biologist of his generation, and perhaps of the century\"; and Sahotra Sarkar as \"probably the most prescient biologist of this [20th] century.\" According to a Cambridge student, \"he seemed to be the last man who might know all there was to be known.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kin selection", "response": ["Charles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects, such as honey bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms (the same \"stock\") would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time. R.A. Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S. Haldane in 1932 set out the mathematics of kin selection, with Haldane famously joking that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins. In 1964, W.D. Hamilton popularised the concept and the major advance in the mathematical treatment of the phenomenon by George R. Price which has become known as Hamilton's rule. In the same year, John Maynard Smith used the actual term kin selection for the first time.", "The earliest mathematically formal treatments of kin selection were by R.A. Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S. Haldane in 1932 and 1955. J.B.S. Haldane fully grasped the basic quantities and considerations in kin selection, famously writing \"I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins\". (see also: Haldane's Wikiquote entry)  Haldane's remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a \"fair deal\" in evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent, nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a diploid population that is randomly mating and previously outbred). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings.q:J. B. S. Haldane In 1955 he clarified:"]}]}}
