His collection of humorous postcard cartoons \"The Rules Of Golf\" was published by Perrier in 1906, and rapidly became a best-selling series. Other similar sporting themes (including \"The Rules Of Cricket\") followed with equal commercial success.\nHe married Helena Wallace (of Wadhurst, Sussex) in Lambeth in 1907, and by 1911 the couple were living at Hogarth House, Richmond Upon Thames, Surrey. Their daughter Irene Crombie was born there in 1914.\nIn 1915, part of Hogarth House was sold to leading Bloomsbury Set socialites Leonard and Virginia Woolf, who named their hobby business the Hogarth Press after the building.\nCharles Crombie continued to produce illustrations for books and magazines in the UK and US throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including the Dodd Mead edition of W. M. Thackeray's Vanity Fair (New York City, 1924). He illustrated 11 of P. G.
