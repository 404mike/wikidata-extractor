Foggo's music, which he describes as \"modern, bizarre, non-influenced, up tempo ska\", is characterised by his observational and darkly comic lyricism, as well as his manic and boisterous stage personality.\nFoggo's most recent studio album, Mad, was released in 2010 on V2 Records, and his band continues to tour Europe extensively. In addition, Foggo has also operated his own all-ska record label and booking agency Skanky'Lil Music since 1990, leading him to be called \"the hardest working man in ska\" and \"a ska missionary\" on a \"never ending quest of playing and supporting ska music where ever he goes\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jaya the Cat", "response": ["After the release of Hedonism, the band was joined by Johan \"Leon\" van 't Zand (live keys, ex-Mark Foggo) to complete the live formation.
