His first published work, A Lecture on Human Happiness, was broadly supportive of the ideas of Robert Owen, although he would later criticise Owen's communitarianism. Gray's critique of laissez-faire capitalism is usually associated with the school of Ricardian socialism and he was one of the earliest writers to advocate a centrally-planned economy. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Gray", "response": ["John Gray may refer to:", "*John Gray (North Carolina politician), American politician, member of the North Carolina General Assembly of 1777", "*John Gray (socialist) (1799\u20131883), English economic pamphleteer, utopian socialist, and exponent of Ricardian economics", "*John Gray (New Zealand politician) (1801\u20131859), member of the New Zealand Parliament", "*Sir John Gray (Irish politician) (1815\u20131875), Irish Member of Parliament for Kilkenny, 1865\u20131875", "*John Gray (Wisconsin politician, born 1817) (1817\u2013?), American politician, member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*John Gray (Ontario politician) (1837\u20131917), Canadian politician, member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario", "*John Gray (New South Wales politician) (1841\u20131914), Australian senator", "*John Gray (Victorian politician, died 1925) (c. 1853\u20131925), Australian politician, member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "*John Gray (North Dakota politician) (1877\u20131952), American politician, North Dakota State Treasurer", "*Sir John Gray (diplomat) (1936\u20132003), British diplomat", "*John Gray (Oshawa politician) (born 1959), former mayor of Oshawa, Ontario, Canada", "*John Gray (barrister) (1807\u20131875), British barrister and legal writer", "*John Gray (American Revolutionary War soldier) (1764\u20131868), U.S. soldier, said to be the longest surviving veteran of the war", "*John Gray (Medal of Honor) (1836\u20131887), Medal of Honor recipient in the American Civil War", "*Sir John Gray (Royal Navy officer) (1913\u20131998), British admiral", "*John Gray (1811\u20131891), Scottish engineer and philanthropist for whom the Gray's School of Art is named", "*John Gray (poet) (1866\u20131934), English poet and Catholic priest", "*John Gray (mythologist) (1913\u20132000), Scottish author of books on history and mythology", "*John Gray (philosopher) (born 1948), British philosopher", "*John Gray (American author) (born 1951), American author best known for his book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus", "*John Gray (Canadian author), Canadian journalist and biographer", "*John Gray (museum administrator), American museum director", "*John Gray (Episcopalian minister) (1646\u20131717), minister of the Episcopal Church of Scotland", "*John Gray (Scottish bishop) (1817\u20131872), Roman Catholic vicar apostolic for Western Scotland", "*John Gray (Anglican priest) (1823\u20131890), Archdeacon of Hong Kong", "*John Gray (New Zealand bishop) (1947\u20132015), New Zealand Anglican bishop", "*John Gray (mathematician) (died 1769), Scottish mathematician, author and Rector of Aberdeen University", "*John Gray (locomotive engineer), locomotive superintendent of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, 1845\u20131847", "*Sir John Gray (physiologist) (1918\u20132011), British physiologist", "*John Gray (Canadian banker) (c. 1755\u20131829), president of the Bank of Montreal", "*John Gray, British founder of Gray and Davison pipe organ builders in 1841", "*John Gray (British banker) (1934\u20132009), British banker", "*John Gray (Australian footballer) (1888\u20131947), Australian rules footballer for Melbourne University FC and medical doctor", "*John Gray (runner, born 1894) (1894\u20131942), American Olympic runner", "*John Gray (boxer) (1906\u20131964), Filipino Olympic boxer", "*John Gray (English sportsman) (born 1948), English cricketer, and rugby union and rugby league footballer", "*John Gray (ice hockey) (born 1949), Canadian ice hockey player", "*John Gray (director), American writer and director", "*John Gray, television news anchor on WXXA-TV in Albany, New York", "*John Gray (master mariner) (1819\u20131872), British captain of the SS Great Britain", "*John Gray (nightwatchman) (died 1858), owner of Greyfriars Bobby"]}, {"page": "Real prices and ideal prices", "response": ["A distinction between real (or actual) prices and ideal prices, was introduced in Marx's Grundrisse notebooks.Karl Marx, Grundrisse.

Orbiston was visited by several English co-operators who were keen to see its progress. One visitor was the economic writer John Gray, who published an address of advice and criticism of Combe's experiment: A Word of Advice to the Orbistonians, on the Principles Which Ought to Regulate their Present Proceedings (1826). Like George Mudie before him, Gray was alarmed by the lack of any management plan for the community. Combe had accepted all applicants for membership, without regard for what type of work they were capable of undertaking. As a result, Gray thought, the community was failing to perform the tasks necessary for its survival. While Gray was fulsome in his praise of Combe as a person he said that he was \"too little of a theorist... his mind was very prematurely devoted to practical measures.\"Gray, John, The Social System (London, 1831) pp. 341/53.
