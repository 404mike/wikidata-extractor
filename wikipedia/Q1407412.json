While still at school he was the first captain of the newly formed Welsh Secondary Schools XV in 1924. He then joined Llanelli RFC, moving to Swansea in December 1927. A teacher by profession, he moved to St Helens to teach at Cowley Grammar School in 1929, and played rugby for Waterloo and Lancashire, captaining Lancashire to the championship in 1934\u201335.\nAfter Llanelli's victory against the touring New Zealand Maoris, he won his first cap for Wales against England in 1927. Against Scotland in 1931 he played for 70 minutes with a broken collarbone and scored a try. As captain he led Wales to victory over England at Twickenham in 1933, overcoming the \"Twickenham bogey\" that had haunted Wales. However, after the match against Ireland the same year, Thomas fell out with the selectors, who had selected a prop as flanker and a flanker as prop for the match. Thomas ignored this and played them in their usual positions, and never played for Wales again.\nIn 1936 he moved to Birmingham to teach at King Edward VI School Aston, and died there in 1977. An extension to a building at the school, opened in May 2008, is named in his honour.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wales national rugby union team", "response": ["A resurgence of both economy and rugby union followed in the 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years.

In 1933 Boon was chosen to face England at Twickenham, a stadium Wales had failed to win at in ten attempts. Captained by Watcyn Thomas, Boon later argued that the Welsh forwards deserved all the credit for the Welsh victoryGoodwin (1984), pg 192. even though Boon scored all the Welsh points in a 7\u20133 victory. At half-time, England led the game 3\u20130 with a try from Walter Elliot; but soon after the restart, England's Ronald Gerrard kicked a loose ball across the ground straight into Boon's arms,Wales Rugby Union, Wales vs England Classics 1933 and he calmly drop kicked the ball through the posts to take a 4\u20133 lead. A few minutes later Boon had extended the lead when the ball came back from a maul to Davey, who passed to Boon, and with the English defence out of position, he crossed at the corner and touched the ball down behind the posts for a try. Vivian Jenkins converted the try which was registered on the score board, but strangely the referee would later disallow the attempt after the game. The decision did not change the result, and Wales had finally beaten the 'Twickenham bogey' and Boon was hailed as a Welsh hero. Boon missed the next game against Scotland due to a knee injury but was back to face Ireland. Wales lost the game and the Welsh selectors dropped 11 of the squad from future fixtures.

Isaac was placed at open-side flanker, opposite the veteran Tom Arthur who was positioned on the blind side.Smith (1980), pg 274. In an exciting match Isaac, along with Turnbull, and Arthur, continually spoiled the English scrum.Smith (1980), pg 276.
