Norman's early success was based in part on the frankness of his memoirs and in part on the style of his writing, which contained both renditions of cockney speakers and his own poor spelling. Jeffrey Bernard in an obituary of Norman wrote that he was\n\na 'natural' writer of considerable wit, powers of sardonic observation and with a razor sharp ear for dialogue particularly as spoken in the underworld.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theatre Workshop", "response": ["*1959 Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be by Frank Norman, music by Lionel Bart", "* Frank Norman"]}, {"page": "List of musicals: A to L", "response": ["| Frank Norman"]}, {"page": "Tom Keating", "response": ["The same year Keating was arrested (1977), he published his autobiography with Geraldine and Frank Norman.

James Booth stands out for his genuinely observed portrait of Spider, Bernie Winters appears to be one of those rare comedians who can keep his moronic style of clowning free from offensiveness, and Niall MacGinnis (Governor), Harry Andrews (Chief Officer) and Ian Hendry (rival mobsters) all catch the eye.  Anthony Newley is rather at sea as a psychiatrist, but plays with a likable modesty and warmth, and an improved Anne Aubrey discretely burlesques Jayne Mansfield.  There is much in this film that is conventionally weak and structurally uneven, yet it gets closer to contemporary feeling than numerous more ambitious comedies.  The dialogue, particularly, strikes an authentic note, and Ken Hughes' debt to Frank Norman, who wrote the original story, seems considerable.\" while TV Guide noted, \"Though there are some genuinely funny moments in the film, Newley is miscast as the compassionate psychologist. Though relatively straightforward for its first half, the plot becomes convoluted and the motivations are twisted in the second half.\""]}, {"page": "Maurice Richardson", "response": ["After leaving the Communist Party in the 1950s, Richardson worked as a book reviewer.
