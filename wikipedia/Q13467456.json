He then captained his first match as the club's player, following Henri Lansbury's injury, on 29 August 2015, in a 2\u20131 loss against Cardiff City. Following his debut, Mills started each of Nottingham Forest's first eight matches of the season, scoring twice, before an injury sustained shortly after equalizing against Middlesbrough on 19 September 2015, forcing him to miss the club's next away match Huddersfield Town. He returned to the starting eleven in Nottingham Forest's next game at home to Hull City on 3 October 2015, but received a straight red card from referee Nigel Miller in the 87th minute of the game following an aerial challenge with Hull's on-loan Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom, as the club lost the game 1\u20130. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up as captain against Sheffield Wednesday on 31 October 2015, as Nottingham Forest lost 1\u20130. Since returning to the first team, Mills regained his first team place, playing in the centre\u2013back position and resumed his captain duties in the absence of Chris Cohen and Andy Reid. On 5 December 2015, he scored twice in a 3\u20130 defeat of Fulham, with a third headed effort in injury time hitting the crossbar. Following his performance, Mills was named Team of the Week. Having played an integral role in an unbeaten December for the club, he was nominated for the SkyBet Championship Player of the Month Award on 7 January 2016, but lost out to Adam Clayton. Five days later on 12 January 2016, just after the announcement, he scored his fifth goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Birmingham City. Mills followed up with the next four matches by helping the club keep four consecutive clean sheets between 16 January 2016 and 6 February 2016.
