He is best known in the English-speaking world for his roles as the villain Hugo Drax in the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker, the detective Claude Lebel in The Day of the Jackal, The Abbot in The Name of the Rose and Dupont d'Ivry in The Remains of the Day.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2020", "response": ["** Michael Lonsdale, French actor (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Centre Pompidou", "response": ["* Lewis Gilbert, Moonraker, 1979.

The film starred Edward Fox as an English assassin hired to kill French president Charles de Gaulle, and Michael Lonsdale as the French detective charged with stopping him. Zinnemann was intrigued by the opportunity to direct a film in which the audience would already be able to guess the ending (the Jackal failing his mission), and was pleased when it ultimately became a hit with the public.Arthur Nolletti, ed., The Films of Fred Zinnemann: Critical Perspectives, SUNY Press, 1999, p. 20"]}, {"page": "Vaux-le-Vicomte", "response": ["The ch\u00e2teau buildings and grounds have been used in at least 13 productions, a full 70, in fact, according to the owners.

It can also be seen in the background in the 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask. In addition, the ch\u00e2teau appeared in several episodes of The Revolution, which is a documentary television series about the American Revolutionary War that was broadcast by History Channel in 2006.

In Frankenheimer's film, the r\u014dnin are former intelligence operatives who are unemployed at the end of the Cold War; devoid of purpose, they become highly-paid mercenaries. Michael Lonsdale's character elaborates on the analogy in an anecdote about the forty-seven r\u014dnin told with miniatures, comparing the film's characters to the 18th-century r\u014dnin of Japan. In his essay, \"Action and Abstraction in Ronin\", Stephen Prince wrote that the r\u014dnin metaphor explores themes of \"service, honor, and obligation to complex ways by showing that service may entail betrayal and that honor may be measured according to disparate terms\".
