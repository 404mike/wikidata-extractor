His style is surreal and contains elements of slapstick, absurdity and silliness. He is currently presenting The Sexy Ads Show on Fiver/Channel Five.\nHe co-hosted ITV2's Lip Service with Holly Willoughby, and acted in a number of notable television comedies including Nathan Barley, Man to Man with Dean Learner, and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, as well as in London's West End. His stand up album, Things I Don't Have To Do, was released in the summer of 2006. He appeared on the fifth season of the NBC TV show Last Comic Standing. He was a member of the Cambridge Footlights troupe that included Matthew Holness, Richard Ayoade and John Oliver. He was also a founding member of the Alternative Alternative movement. In 2009, Brown appeared in 3 mobile's sponsorship bumpers for various Channel 4 comedy programmes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "response": ["Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC's The Big Read survey and programme, broadcast in late 2003. The film, directed by Deep Sehgal, starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent, alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect, Nigel Planer as the voice of Marvin, Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought, Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide, Roger Lloyd-Pack as Slartibartfast, and Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg."]}, {"page": "Nathan Barley", "response": ["Other recurring characters include Nathan's idiot flatmate Toby (Rhys Thomas) and the staff at Dan Ashcroft's magazine, Sugar Ape: asinine chief editor Jonatton Yeah? (Charlie Condou), Ned Smanks (Richard Ayoade) and Rufus Onslatt (Spencer Brown), a pair of gormless graphic designers, and receptionist Sasha (Nina Sosanya). Barley has an inoffensive young assistant called Pingu (Ben Whishaw). The eccentric and ludicrous Doug Rocket, founder member of The Veryphonics, and played by comedian David Hoyle (a spoof of Dave Stewart of Eurythmics), also appears in several episodes.", "*Spencer Brown as Rufus Onslatt", "In the pilot of the show, characters are different from those in the actual series. The character of Claire already knows Nathan and Pingu instead of meeting them in the first episode of the series. The character of Dan is decidedly darker and gets one up on Nathan and the idiots more often. Ned Smanks and Rufus Onslatt do not appear in the pilot, but Spencer Brown does play a minor character in the art gallery scene. Jonattan Yeah? makes a brief appearance and is largely the same. The pilot was never transmitted, but was included as an extra on the DVD.  Story elements and some scenes shot for the pilot became used in the third, fourth and fifth episodes of the series, where the familiarity between the characters, and Dan Ashcroft's darker nature, make greater sense in context."]}, {"page": "Spencer Brown", "response": ["Spencer Brown may refer to:", "*Spencer Brown (offensive tackle) (born 1998), American football offensive tackle", "*Spencer Brown (running back) (born 1998), American football running back", "*Spencer Brown (fighter) (born 1997), Scottish fighter", "*Spencer Brown (rugby union, born 1921) (1921\u2013c. 1973), rugby union player who represented Australia", "*Spencer Brown (rugby union, born 1973), English rugby union player", "*Spencer Brown (comedian), English comedian, actor and writer", "*Spencer Brown (musician) (born 1994), American musician"]}, {"page": "List of former Footlights members", "response": ["| Spencer Brown || 1978 || \u2014 ||  Comedian"]}]}}
