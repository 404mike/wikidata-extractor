I. Taylor in a paper of 1958. This situation is most often encountered during drainage processes through media such as soils.  It occurs when a less viscous fluid is injected, displacing a more viscous fluid; in the inverse situation, with the more viscous displacing the other, the interface is stable and no instability is seen. Essentially the same effect occurs driven by gravity (without injection) if the interface is horizontal and separates two fluids of different densities, the heavier one being above the other: this is known as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the rectangular configuration the system evolves until a single finger (the Saffman\u2013Taylor finger) forms, whilst in the radial configuration the pattern grows forming fingers by successive tip-splitting."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (P)", "response": ["*Philip Saffman"]}, {"page": "Burgers vortex", "response": ["Non-axisymmetric Burgers' vortices emerge in non-axisymmetric strained flows.
