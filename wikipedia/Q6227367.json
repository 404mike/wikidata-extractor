Among them was Orpen's studio assistant and former pupil, Se\u00e1n Keating. Keating encouraged Orpen to do likewise, but he refused and committed himself to supporting the British war effort. In December 1915 Orpen was commissioned into the Army Service Corps and reported for clerical duty at London's Kensington Barracks in March 1916. Throughout 1916 Orpen continued painting portraits, most notably one of a despondent Winston Churchill, but soon started using both his own contacts, and those of Evelyn Saint-George, to secure a war artist posting. Orpen knew both Philip Sassoon, the private secretary to Sir Douglas Haig, and also Sir John Cowans, the Quartermaster General of the British Army. In January 1917, the Daily Mirror reported that Haig himself had \"conferred\" on Orpen the title of an official artist with the British Army in France. The Department of Information, who were actually running the British war artist scheme, were given little choice but to accept the situation. While the other artists on the Department scheme remained at the honorary rank of second lieutenant and were restricted to three weeks visiting the Western Front, Orpen was promoted to major and given indefinite permission to remain at the Front. An officer from Kensington Barracks was appointed as his military aide, a car and driver were made available in France and Orpen paid for a batman and assistant to accompany him."]}, {"page": "Order of the Redeemer", "response": ["* John Cowans"]}, {"page": "Quartermaster-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1912\u20131919 General Sir John Cowans"]}, {"page": "John Cowan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Cowans (1862\u20131921), Quartermaster-General to the Forces"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir John Cowans"]}, {"page": "Burney's Academy", "response": ["*John Cowans (1862\u20131921)"]}, {"page": "General Officers of World War I", "response": ["# General Sir John Cowans (Quartermaster-General to the Forces from 1912 to 1919)"]}, {"page": "1913 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Major-General John Cowans, CB, MVO, Quartermaster-General to the Forces, Third Military Member, Army Council."]}, {"page": "John Steven Cowans", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Cowans"]}, {"page": "Cowans, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Cowans"]}, {"page": "Francis George Bond", "response": ["Following the outbreak of the First World War, on 26 August 1914 Bond was recalled, and was appointed Assistant Director (Quartering) by his former colleague in India, General Sir John Cowans, now Quartermaster-General to the Forces.
