He played for just one season \u2013 1962 \u2013 captaining the team as an amateur in the year before the players and gentlemen distinction was formally abolished.\nA fine all-round sportsman at Repton, Joe Blackledge joined the Army and played much cricket for it in Germany. On leaving the Army, he captained Lancashire's second XI and was a successful batsman for Chorley in the Northern League. He was the second-top scorer in the league in 1961.The Lancashire team he led in 1962 was one of the weakest in the club's long history and finished second from bottom in the table, losing 16 matches and winning only two. Blackledge hit 33 and 68 in the first match against Glamorgan, but contributed little with the bat thereafter, finishing with 548 runs at 15.65 in the Championship. He returned to running the family textile business at the end of the season.\nHe later served on the Lancashire committee for many years and was President of the club in 2001.\nHe was the uncle of the former England rugby union captain Bill Beaumont, who took over the family textile business from him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["With the retirement of Nigel Howard in 1954, Lancashire appointed its first professional captain, Cyril Washbrook, who would captain the club for the next six years. In 1954 Geoff Pullar, Ken Grieves and Alan Wharton all scored over 2,000\u00a0runs, whilst Brian Statham, Ken Higgs and Tommy Greenhough all took over 100\u00a0wickets; despite this, Lancashire managed to finish only 5th. Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, Bob Barber. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000\u00a0runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100\u00a0wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber's inexperience and Statham's and Geoff Pullar's England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of Joe Blackledge, who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches. After a period of unrest, Brian Statham was appointed captain between 1965 and 1967 and Lancashire's results improved. Statham retired in 1968 with 1,816 first-class wickets, a record for the club.

He was replaced by Joe Blackledge in 1962, who met with no greater success as the county endured a difficult season. Joining Warwickshire, Barber was encouraged to play his shots and began to play regularly for England as an opening batsman. His greatest innings, and his only Test century, was made in the Third Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1965\u201366. He made 185 off 255 balls and added 234 in even time with Geoff Boycott for the first wicket. It remains the highest score by an Englishman on the opening day of an Ashes Test. E.W.
