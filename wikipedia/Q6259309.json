He played at representative level for Great Britain, and at club level for Swinton, as a left wing, i.e. number 5. Stopford formed a highly successful left-wing partnership with his left-centre, and fellow Great Britain international, Alan Buckley. He coached at representative level for Wellington and at club level for Swinton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swinton Lions", "response": ["Throughout the late 1940s, and the 1950s the Lions strove unsuccessfully to repeat former glories and often flattered to deceive, but the appointment of Welshman Cliff Evans as coach signalled a renaissance. Concentrating on a youth policy and training methods beyond his era, Evans began to model an exciting, young Swinton team. This new era saw some notable Welshmen in the Lions' ranks such as Rees Thomas, Ralph Morgan, Frank Osmond, Dai Moses, Ron Morgan and Graham Rees. Also in the 'swinging 1960s' years the Lions fielded real top class performers such as GB internationals Ken Gowers at full-back, Alan Buckley at left-centre plus his wing partner, John Stopford. During this same decade, local talent came to the fore with the likes of Graham Williams (scrum-half), Derek Whitehead (full-back/utility), Barry Simpson (2nd-row) and classy GB loose-forward Dave Robinson. During the second half of the decade other prominent players turned out for the Lions. Of these, perhaps the most worthy were stand-off Billy 'Daz' Davies, scrum-half Peter Kenny and 2nd-rowers Rod Smith (ex-Workington Town) and the highly respected Bill Holliday (ex-Whitehaven, Hull Kingston Rovers, Cumberland and GB). In fact it was the Lions 1960s quartet of Gowers, Buckley, Stopford and Robinson who were selected to play for the GB tourists on the 1966 tour to Australasia. Gowers was even given the honour of being awarded the position of tour vice-captain. However, some critics saw this as an apology for overlooking him when the previous tourists were chosen in 1962, when many believe he was easily the most outstanding player to wear a full-back's jersey in the British game.", "* John Stopford won caps for Great Britain while at Swinton 12-caps", "*Most tries in a season: 48 by Jim Valentine, 1888\u201389, (2nd most tries in a season, John Stopford, 42, season 1963\u201364)"]}, {"page": "1936 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 23 August \u2013 John Stopford, rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Stopford", "response": ["* John Stopford (rugby league)", "* John Stopford, Baron Stopford of Fallowfield"]}, {"page": "Alan Buckley (rugby league)", "response": ["Four Swinton (\"the Lions\") players took part in the 1966 Great Britain Lions tour to Australasia, they were; Alan Buckley, Ken Gowers (vice-captain), Dave Robinson and John Stopford."]}, {"page": "Ken Gowers", "response": ["Four Swinton (\"the Lions\") players took part in the 1966 Great Britain Lions tour to Australasia, they were; Alan Buckley, Ken Gowers (vice-captain), Dave Robinson and John Stopford."]}, {"page": "Dave Robinson (rugby league)", "response": ["Four Swinton (\"the Lions\") players took part in the 1966 Great Britain Lions tour to Australasia, they were; Alan Buckley, Ken Gowers (vice-captain), Dave Robinson, and John Stopford."]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* John Stopford circa-1961"]}, {"page": "John Stopford", "response": ["John Stopford may refer to:", "* John Stopford (rugby league)", "*John Stopford, Baron Stopford of Fallowfield, British peer, physician and anatomist"]}, {"page": "Johnny Stopford", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Stopford (rugby league)"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|John Stopford||align=\"center\" style=\"background: #eeeeee\"|WG||align=\"center\"|Peter Dimond", "|align=\"center\"|John Stopford||align=\"center\" style=\"background: #eeeeee\"|WG||align=\"center\"|Peter Dimond"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 1998", "response": ["*John Stopford, 61, English rugby player."]}, {"page": "List of British rugby league champions", "response": ["|  John Stopford ( Swinton)"]}]}}
