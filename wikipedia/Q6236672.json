Gwynn's editions comprised the third and final section of the 1905 United Bible Societies Peshitta, still the standard scholarly edition today. Gwynn considered that this Aramaic Revelation was not from the original Peshitta version but one which Gwynn identified as being from what he called the Philoxenian Version, an Aramaic revision of the Syriac Bible made under the auspices of Philoxenus, bishop of Mabbug circa 507.Matthias Henze The Syriac Apocalypse of Daniel: Introduction, Text, and Commentary 2001- Page 16 \"The book of Revelation was initially not included in the Peshitta and only slowly won canonical esteem in Syrian Christianity.
