Having been commissioned to remix Chakra's \"Home\", Tony McGuinness recruited Grant and Siljam\u00e4ki to help him complete the remix. When the group was searching for a name to use for their Chakra remix, the inspiration came from a web page belonging to an American motivational trainer coincidentally named Jono Grant. Grant had the poster stuck to his wall. The slogan used by the motivational trainer was \"Above & Beyond\", and they decided to use that as their name. Although the group was relatively unknown at the time, their remix of Chakra's \"Home\" was picked over remixes by Rob Searle and Tilt to be the A-side mix, and, after plays by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1, it reached number one in the UK club charts.", "Following acoustic shows in London and Los Angeles, Above & Beyond premiered the concert film Live From Porchester Hall on 24 January 2014 across the world.
