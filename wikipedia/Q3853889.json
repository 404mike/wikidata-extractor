The approach of these revivals mirrors shifting views of the play on the part of literary critics. One of the most influential 20th-century readings of the play is by the critic Jonathan Dollimore, which claims that the play is essentially a form of radical parody that challenges orthodox Jacobean beliefs about Providence and patriarchy.Dollimore, Jonathan (1984) Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; pp. 139\u201350. Dollimore asserts the play is best understood as \"subversive black camp\" insofar as it \"celebrates the artificial and the delinquent; it delights in a play full of innuendo, perversity and subversion ... through parody it declares itself radically skeptical of ideological policing though not independent of the social reality which such skepticism simultaneously discloses\".Dollimore, p. 149.

The play critiques the failings of the legal system by demonstrating how easily it may be abused by powerful political figures. Marston also follows the generic tradition of forcing the revenger to compromise his own morality in the process of exacting revenge. Eric Hobsbawm characterizes this didactic paradox as \"banditry,\" or the necessity of individual transgression in the face of unjust rule and the popular elevation of such individuals to the status of \"folk hero.\" This moral quandary is further complicated by the religious ethics of the early modern period, including conflicting Protestant and Catholic ideas about the relationship between the living and the dead. Andrugio, like the ghosts of Shakespeare's Hamlet and Kyd's Spanish Tragedy, personifies the period of unrest between death and interment, sometimes interpreted as an allusion to Catholic purgatory. The play is also fraught with physical violence, including the display of Feliche's mutilated body, the strangulation of Strotzo, the murder of the child Julio and subsequent revelation of his body at the banquet table, and the forcible removal of Piero's tongue. Piero makes his first entrance with \"his arms bare, smeared in blood, a poniard in one hand bloody, and a torch in the other\" (1.1, s.d.) and Antonio enters in an almost identical manner after his murder of Julio, \"his arms bloody, [with] a torch and poniard\" (3.5, s.d.). This dramaturgical parallel is not only a visual representation of culpability but a means of foregrounding one of the other common themes of revenge tragedy, namely the inevitable mirroring of the villain and the tragic hero. At stake here is a physical manifestation of what Jonathan Dollimore describes as \"discontinuous identity,\" or the plight of characters experiencing social and psychic dislocation as they struggle against an inherently corrupt society. The theme of disorientation is further complicated by extreme feelings of grief which lead to distraction and madness, another common feature of revenge tragedy, displayed in Antonio's Revenge both by Maria's running onstage with \"her hair about her ears\" (3.1, s.d.) and Pandulpho's inability to adhere to his stoic philosophy after his son's murder. Antonio's Revenge is typical of its genre in depicting the fatal consequences of socio-political and moral confusion.
