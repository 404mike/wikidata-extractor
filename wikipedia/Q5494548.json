He made exactly 400 Football League appearances in thirteen seasons with Burnley.Born in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, Barron began his career with Northern League side Stockton St. Mary's in the late 1890s. Described as 'the best back in the Northern League', he was signed by newly promoted Football League First Division club Burnley in June 1898. At the start of the 1898\u201399 season, Barron was unable to displace David Beveridge from the right-half position. He made his debut for the club in the sixth match of the campaign, a 1\u20131 draw away at Sheffield United on 1 October 1898. Barron kept his place in the Burnley team for the remainder of the season, playing in 29 league matches and 2 FA Cup ties. He retained his starting berth for the majority of the 1899\u20131900 season, making 30 league appearances, but was dropped for the final two matches of the campaign in favour of Bill Jenkinson. The season ended in disappointment for Burnley as they were relegated to the Second Division after winning only 11 of their 34 fixtures.Barron was an ever-present for Burnley during the 1900\u201301 season as the side finished third in the Second Division. On 26 January 1901 he scored his first Football League goal, netting the first in the 5\u20131 win against Chesterfield at Turf Moor. Barron scored again six matches later as Burnley were beaten 1\u20132 away at Barnsley. He made his 100th league appearance for Burnley on 12 October 1901 in the 0\u20133 home defeat to local rivals Preston North End, and was again almost ever-present in the 1901\u201302 season. He scored a penalty kick in the 1\u20130 win against Newton Heath, who would later become Manchester United, on 28 March 1902, Burnley's last win of the campaign. Barron played in all 99 of the side's competitive fixtures between March 1902 and January 1905, scoring seven goals (five of them penalties) during this period. During the 1902\u201303 campaign, he had a brief spell at outside forward following the departure of Tommy Morrison to Manchester United.On 8 October 1904, Barron played his 200th league match for Burnley in the 1\u20133 loss to Gainsborough Trinity, the first in a run of seven consecutive defeats. He missed only one game during the 1904\u201305 season; his place at right-half was taken by David Walders for the 0\u20132 defeat away at Blackpool on 21 January 1905. Barron then played 37 competitive matches for Burnley in the 1905\u201306 season, scoring once. Following the arrival of half-back Rupert Cawthorne from Clitheroe before the 1906\u201307 campaign, Barron began to play at right-fullback. For the fourth time in his Burnley career, he played in every Second Division game during the campaign. His 300th Football League appearance came in the final match of the season, a 1\u20131 draw with Glossop at Turf Moor.Barron remained a regular member of the Burnley team well into the 1909\u201310 season, but found himself out of the side after the death of manager Spen Whittaker in April 1910. Caretaker manager Richard Wadge selected youngster Tom Bamford for the last eight matches of the campaign. The Horwich-born defender would go on to play 137 league games for the Clarets. In the summer of 1910, new manager John Haworth signed Scottish fullback Bob Reid from Cowdenbeath, and Barron subsequently found his first-team opportunities limited, playing only four matches in the 1910\u201311 campaign. He made his 400th and final league appearance for Burnley in the goal-less draw with Barnsley on 1 April 1911. Barron retired from professional football at the end of the season, aged 31, and later became the landlord of a public house in Burnley town centre.Barron died 18 August 1939 at his home in Burnley following a long illness, he was 60 years old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rupert Cawthorne", "response": ["At the end of that season, Cawthorne signed for Second Division Burnley. He went straight into their league team at right half with Jonathan Cretney at centre half, displacing Fred Barron from the half-back line to right back. After the first match, Cretney and Cawthorne changed places, and Cawthorne continued in his preferred centre-half position until the turn of the year, when he lost his place through injury and, following the arrival of the ageing but still influential former England international centre half Alex Leake, did not regain it. He was not retained at the end of the season, and returned to Clitheroe Central. By the end of November 1907, his standard had \"greatly improved\", according to the Lancashire Daily Post, and Burnley re-signed him. He remained on their books for the next two-and-a-half seasons, but appeared only rarely for their first teamthree times in the 1908\u201309 season and once in 1909\u201310."]}, {"page": "Barron (surname)", "response": ["*Fred Barron (fl. 1898\u20131911), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Fred Baron", "response": ["* Fred Barron (1879\u20131939), English football wing half", "* Fred Barron (producer), American television producer, created My Family"]}, {"page": "Fred Barron (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Barron"]}, {"page": "The Life and Love of Dr. Susan", "response": ["Eleanor Phelps starred as Dr. Susan Chandler, a physician who was married with two children, twins Marilyn and Dickie (Gloria Mann and Tommy Hughes).
