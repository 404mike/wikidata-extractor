He joined Middlesbrough in 1901 becoming a professional player. He played only four games for the club.In 1904 manager Syd King signed Piercy for West Ham United from Middlesbrough, along with Christopher Carrick. He appointed him as captain in 1907 to replace David Gardner who had retired the previous season. \nNicknamed \"The Old War Horse\" during his time at West Ham, Piercy had a tough tackling style and was regularly in trouble with referees. He was once suspended for a month, in September 1907, for punching an opposition player in a match against Swindon Town. In October with little regard for his previous suspension he was sent-off again in a match against Millwall. Piercy tackled Millwall's Charlie Comrie, resulting in him being carried from \"the field in an unconscious state\". Piercy was again suspended.Despite his disciplinary problems Piercy became the first West Ham United player to play 200 games when he appeared on 17 April 1911 against Southampton. Tommy Randall replaced Piercy as captain for the 1911\u201312 season and on 20 January 1912 Piercy was injured against Plymouth Argyle in what turned out to be his final game for West Ham. After playing 214 games he retired from playing and was appointed assistant trainer under Charlie Paynter with responsibility for the reserve team.\nHe was awarded two benefit or testimonial games. The first in 1910 when he was allowed to keep the gate receipts from a West Ham game against New Brompton and posthumously in 1931 when an Isthmian League side played West Ham on 1 October 1931. Piercy was also a member of Essex County bowls team, a cricketer for local teams and held a golf handicap of two.He died in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["|  Frank Piercy"]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Frank Piercy"]}, {"page": "Christopher Carrick", "response": ["Born in Stockton, Carrick played for Middlesbrough, scoring six goals in 26 Football League matches over three seasons. He was signed by West Ham United manager Syd King for the 1904\u201305 season, part of an influx of new players that also included Boro teammate Frank Piercy. He made his debut on 8 October 1904 in a 2\u20130 home win against Swindon Town. On 28 January 1905 he scored his first goals for West Ham with a hat-trick in a 6\u20132 home win against Luton Town. He played only 18 games, scoring six goals, before he came to the attention of Tottenham Hotspur, moving to them in the summer of 1905. Signed to replace John Kirwan who had moved to Chelsea, Carrick did not play regularly for Tottenham until the middle of the 1905\u201306 season. In March 1906 Tottenham travelled to play away games at Bristol Rovers and at Plymouth Argyle. On returning to London Carrick and a teammate were suspended by Tottenham for \"ignoring training rules\". He did not play for them again and was transferred to Reading before moving to Bradford Park Avenue for the 1907\u201308 season. In 1908 he moved to Ireland to play for Glentoran. "]}]}}
