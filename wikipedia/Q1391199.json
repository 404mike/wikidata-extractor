Upon arriving, Abu Bakr addressed the assembled men with a warning that an attempt to elect a leader outside of Muhammad's own tribe, the Quraysh, would likely result in dissension, as only they can command the necessary respect among the community. He then took Umar and Abu Ubaidah, by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. Habab ibn Mundhir, a veteran from the battle of Badr, countered with his own suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly. The group grew heated upon hearing this proposal and began to argue amongst themselves.

The alleged verses can be read in early biographies of Muhammad by al-W\u0101qid\u012b, Ibn Sa'd and Ibn Ishaq, and the tafsir of al-Tabar\u012b. The first use of the expression is attributed to Sir William Muir in 1858.", "al-L\u0101t, al-'Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t were three goddesses worshipped by the Meccans. Discerning the precise meaning of \"ghar\u0101niq\" has proven difficult, as it is a hapax legomenon (i.e. used only once in the text). Commentators wrote that it meant \"the cranes\". The Arabic word does generally mean a \"crane\" - appearing in the singular as ghirn\u012bq, ghurn\u016bq, ghirnawq and ghurnayq, and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including \"raven, crow\" and \"eagle\". Taken as a segment, \"exalted ghar\u0101niq\" has been translated by Orientalist William Muir to mean \"exalted women\", while contemporary academic Muhammad Manazir Ahsan has translated the same segment as \"high-soaring ones (deities)\". Thus, whether the phrase had intended to attribute a divine nature to the three \"idols\" is a matter of dispute.https://brians.wsu.edu/2017/02/08/the-satanic-verses/ In either case, scholars generally agree on the meaning of the second half of the verse, \"whose intercession is hoped for\", and this by itself would contradict a core tenet of what would become orthodox Islamic doctrine, namely that no saint or deity - nor Mohammad himself - can intercede for Muslims.
