His first work was When Pirates Ruled the Waves, which ran to four editions within a short space of time between 1968 and 1970. This was published by his own company, Impulse Books in Aberdeen.\nHis second book, To be a Pirate King, extended the story into 1971 and caused a sensation in the Netherlands, where it was published by De Telegraaf. It led directly to him working for the British intelligence service, MI6, and a long time involvement in analysis of Libya and, later, the Lockerbie disaster.\nFollowing these, he branched out in the topics covered, including the oil industry, murder, and Scottish Art. As of 2012, he was the author of 42 published books.\nA third offshore radio book appeared consolidating and updating the previous books, entitled Broadcasting from the High Seas.He was a founder member of the Scottish General Publishers' Association.  The first meeting of what was to become what is now Publishing Scotland, took place in a late afternoon in 1973 in the offices of Canongate in Jeffrey Street.\nHe had an Honours degree in Politics and International Relations (Aberdeen University 1970). After fifteen years in publishing, he became a publishing consultant. As a result, he found himself trapped in Yugoslavia as war broke out there on 26 June 1991. His Airbus was bombed in the attack on Ljubljana airport and he then stayed on to report from the front line; from children's hospitals; from refugee columns under fire; and, even, from the mortuaries in Christmas week. This also resulted in his book Somebody Else's War, published in 1992.\nHe stayed on and became a journalist, covering eighteen wars between 1991 and 2001. He worked for the London Daily Telegraph as Colombo correspondent 2000-01 and was columnist for the Daily Mirror there, during which he released 'Fractured Paradise' a photographic analysis of the Sri Lankan conflict found critical of the terrorist group Tamil Tigers. He was expelled as a danger to Sri Lanka's national security in November 2001, at the behest of the Tamil Tigers. He was an editor on the Shanghai Daily from January 2002.\nThe publishers Kennedy & Boyd (Glasgow) brought out an updated version of When Pirates Ruled the Waves in 2007, the fortieth anniversary of the Marine Broadcasting (Offences) Act. In 2009, his autobiography More Thrills than Skills: adventures in journalism, war and terrorism was published by Kennedy & Boyd After settling in Coldingham, Berwickshire, he established a gallery and auction house for Chinese art.  He died on 24 May 2018, leaving behind his wife Sulee and daughter Lucy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Radio City (pirate radio station)", "response": ["* Paul Harris (author) Author Paul Harris' book, When Pirates Ruled the Waves"]}, {"page": "Paul Harris", "response": ["Paul Harris may refer to:", "* Paul Harris (actor) (1917\u20131985), African-American character actor", "* Paul Harris (artist) (1925-2018), American artist and sculptor", "* Paul Harris (author) (1948\u20132018), author and publisher, based in Scotland", "* Paul Harris (choreographer), English", "* Paul Harris (DJ), English DJ, producer and member of house music group Dirty Vegas", "* Paul Harris (film critic) (born 1950), Australian", "* Paul Harris (magician), American", "* Paul Harris (musician), American keyboards player and musician", "* Paul Harris (Home and Away), fictional character in Australian soap opera Home and Away", "* Paul Harris (American football) (born 1954), American football player", "* Paul Harris (basketball) (born 1986), American", "* Paul Harris (Bedfordshire cricketer) (born 1955), English cricketer for Bedfordshire 1976\u201380", "* Paul Harris (South African cricketer) (born 1978), for Northerns, Titans, Western Province and Warwickshire", "* Rousimar Palhares (born 1980), Brazilian mixed martial artist (known in America as Paul Harris)", "* Sir Paul Harris, 2nd Baronet (1595\u20131644), English baronet and Surveyor of the Ordnance", "* Paul Harris (politician) (born 1953), member of the Washington House of Representatives", "* Paul Harris (public servant) (born 1946), head of Electoral Commission in New Zealand", "* Paul Harris (Rotary) (1868\u20131947), lawyer who founded the Rotary Club in 1905", "* Paul Harris, name on the passport of the British activist Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) a founder of the English Defence League)", "* Paul Harris, lawyer, chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association from 2021", "* Paul Harriss (born 1954), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "Radio Caroline", "response": ["*Last of the Pirates.
