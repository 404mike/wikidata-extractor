Produced by Andrew Chen, it is a moderate Eurodance love song. The song's rhythm complements Tsai's interpretation, and its lyrics depicted a love player two-timed a girl. The music style was what Tsai had never performed before, and Tsai indicated: \"In fact, I have always wanted to do different love songs, no longer ballads, but slow songs with rhythm. I have been thinking about it for many years, so when I listened to the demo of this song, I was very excited. Fortunately, the company also supported me.\" The interlude \"Missed Call\" opens with a melody of \"Honey Trap\" and is followed by an intercept message after the disconnection of the destination phone. It is a situational scene of presenting confident love attitude delivered by \"Honey Trap\" turning to the plight of love."]}, {"page": "List of songs recorded by Plan B", "response": ["| \"I Wanna Get Next to You\" (remix) || Danielle Senior, Plan B, Wretch 32, Blemish || \"Take You Home\" || align=\"center\"| 2006 ||"]}, {"page": "List of songs recorded by Jolin Tsai", "response": ["|Luke TsuiGino ChenDanielle SeniorScott Wild"]}]}}
