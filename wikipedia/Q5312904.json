The group has been called \"the all-time giant of sound systems\" and helped launch several notable artists. Count Matchuki is generally credited as Tom's first deejay, before he joined Coxsone Dodd, and Duke Vin was one of Tom's selectors. The sound was also backed by Prince Buster. It was later known as Metromedia.", "Tom played rhythm and blues loved by the \"ghetto folk\" and music intended to attract a more upper-class audience, such as merengue and calypso. There are rumors that Duke Reid, a competing sound system operator who started four years after Tom and is credited with bringing gangland-style tactics to dancehall, drove Tom out of the downtown area of Kingston using ruffians from the Back-O-Wall slum, but Duke Vin insists that Duke and Tom were friends and that Duke's followers never bothered Tom. The closest they came to a sound clash was a set of competing parties in adjacent yards; they never went head-to-head. Tom did, however, move away from the violence of the downtown area to the Silver Slipper club in the more upscale Cross Roads area, a move which did not harm him financially."]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Duke Vin, disk jockey and sound system operator."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2012", "response": ["*Duke Vin, 84, Jamaican-born British disk jockey and sound system operator.Unsung: Duke Vin: sound system pioneer"]}, {"page": "Count Suckle", "response": ["He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and grew up in poverty as one of thirteen children.
