In 1986 she argued that her work and that of her colleagues, mostly women, was of equal value to clinical psychologists, who were predominantly men. Her employers said the difference in pay could be justified because the two groups bargain separately. This claim launched the second longest group action for equal pay for equal work since a 1985 claim by female canteen workers against British Coal. The case involved twenty-six court appearances (including at the European Court of Justice), 2,000 applicants and sixteen test cases."]}, {"page": "Enderby (surname)", "response": ["*Pamela Enderby (born 1949), British speech therapist and academic"]}, {"page": "Pam Enderby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pamela Enderby"]}]}}
