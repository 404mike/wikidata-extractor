During his refereeing career he was initially based in Salford before moving to Kearsley, part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, in 1987. He lived there with his wife Barbara until his death in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UEFA Euro 1988", "response": ["| Neil Midgley"]}, {"page": "Brian Kilcline", "response": ["Kilcline captained Coventry City in the 1987 FA Cup Final at Wembley against Tottenham Hotspur. At the time it was thought that Kilcline was possibly responsible for scoring an own-goal to give Spurs a 2\u20131 lead on the 40 minute mark, but this goal was eventually accredited to Gary Mabbutt. Kilcline and Mabbutt were to clash again in the second half when Kilcline brought down Mabbutt with a tackle. Kilcline was not cautioned by referee Neil Midgley but had to be replaced by substitute Graham Rodger just a minute before the end of normal time due to the injury he himself sustained in the clash. After Coventry's extra time winner (the match finished 3-2) Kilcline limped slowly up the famous Wembley step to receive the trophy for the only time in Coventry's history."]}, {"page": "1989 FIFA World Youth Championship", "response": ["* Neil Midgley"]}, {"page": "FA Cup Final referees", "response": ["|1987||Neil Midgley||R.

Chris Waddle played in a cross from the right wing and Clive Allen beat defender Trevor Peake to the ball to head it past Steve Ogrizovic in the Coventry goal.  The scores were level seven minutes later: a deep cross from Greg Downs was headed on by Keith Houchen to Dave Bennett who rounded Ray Clemence and struck the ball past Steve Hodge into the corner of the Tottenham goal.  Coventry's Cyrille Regis had a goal disallowed and then, five minutes before half-time, Tottenham restored their one-goal lead.  A free kick from Waddle was touched on by Gary Mabbutt and bounced into the far corner of the Coventry goal.  Midway through the second half, Coventry were level once again, with Houchen converting a Bennett cross with a diving header, which would later be selected as the BBC Goal of the Season.  With the game even at full time, extra time was needed to decide the match. The only goal of extra time was scored in its first period when a cross from Lloyd McGrath looped off Mabbutt's left knee and over Clemence for an own goal, making the final score 3\u20132 to Coventry.", "Tottenham wore all-white kit while Coventry played in blue-and-white striped shirts, navy shorts and blue socks. In the league match at Highfield Road, the referee had deemed the two kits too similar in colour and, because they had not brought their away kit, Tottenham had been ordered to wear Coventry's yellow away shirts. There was no such issue with their kit for the final, although due to a mix-up only half of the Tottenham players wore the Holsten sponsorship on their shirts. The referee for the match was Neil Midgley of Greater Manchester.  After the national anthem was played, the Duchess of Kent was introduced to both sides by their respective captains, while accompanied by Bert Millichip, chairman of the Football Association., 00:05:10\u201300:09:18"]}, {"page": "Neil Midgley", "response": ["Neil Midgley may refer to:", "* Neil Midgley (referee), English football referee", "* Neil Midgley (footballer), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2001", "response": ["*Neil Midgley, 58, English football referee, cancer."]}, {"page": "UEFA Euro 1988 Group 1", "response": ["Neil Midgley (England)"]}]}}
