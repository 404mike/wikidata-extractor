John Radcliffe of Philadelphia had offered him $175 in exchange for favoring Chicago, and had implicated teammates Bill Craver, Candy Cummings, Nat Hicks, and Denny Mack, the manager. The Philadelphia ballclub moved against Radcliffe alone and expelled him but the decision was overturned before the next season, on Radcliffe's appeal to the Association.\nMcLean called three no-hitters during his career:  Hugh Daily's on September 13, 1883, Larry Corcoran's on June 27, 1884, and Pud Galvin's on August 4, 1884.
