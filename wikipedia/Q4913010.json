John Radcliffe of Philadelphia had offered him $175 in exchange for favoring Chicago, and had implicated teammates Bill Craver, Candy Cummings, Nat Hicks, and Denny Mack, the manager. The Philadelphia ballclub moved against Radcliffe alone and expelled him but the decision was overturned before the next season, on Radcliffe's appeal to the Association.\nMcLean called three no-hitters during his career:  Hugh Daily's on September 13, 1883, Larry Corcoran's on June 27, 1884, and Pud Galvin's on August 4, 1884.

On August 20, umpire Billy McLean came forward with allegations that a game between Mack's Philadelphia Whites and the Chicago White Stockings had been thrown by the Philadelphia club. McLean claimed that Philadelphia's John Radcliffe had approached him with an offer of $175 in exchange for making calls favorable to the White Stockings. According to McLean, Radcliffe named four other players as complicit in the fix: Mack, Candy Cummings, Bill Craver, and Nat Hicks. The board of directors for the Whites met to consider these charges on September 1, and they elected not to pursue the matter further with any players but Radcliffe, describing McLean's claims as \"hearsay\". The stockholders of the club voted to expel Radcliffe on September 8, by a count of 26\u201315, but he appealed to the judiciary committee of the National Association, and was reinstated on March 2, due to what Henry Chadwick characterized as procedural errors during the course of his expulsion."]}, {"page": "William McLean", "response": ["*Billy McLean (umpire) (1835\u20131927), English professional baseball umpire"]}, {"page": "Kick Kelly", "response": ["After his playing days were over, Kelly became an umpire, working games in both the National League and the American Association.
