The 2014 side were again lauded as Classy Cas for their fast-paced and exciting style, with home grown players such as club captain Michael Shenton, Daryl Clark, Adam Milner, Oliver Holmes, Craig Huby and Andy Lynch, who was returning to the club. The side reached the Challenge Cup final in August 2014, losing to local rivals Leeds 23\u201310, watched by a crowd of 77,914 at Wembley Stadium.

They were beaten 14 \u2013 30 and therefore knocked out of the play-offs. On 29 September 2015, the club announced the death of chairman Jack Fulton. In 2017, the Tigers enjoyed a phenomenal 23 game regular season as they finished 10 points clear at the top of the table prior to the split having won 20 and losing just 3 of their games. They went into the Super 8's having already secured a top four playoff spot by the end of the Super 8's and winning the League Leaders' Shield in the process. In the semifinal against St Helens, Luke Gale\u2014just days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy\u2014kicked a drop-goal in extra time to send Cas to their first Grand Final with a 23\u201322 win. Sadly they didn't carry on the form they had shown all season and were deservedly beaten by Leeds Rhinos 24\u20136 with a late consolation score coming in the last minute to spare Castleford being the first team to fail to score in a Grand Final.
