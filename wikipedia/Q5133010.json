He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler who played from 1935 to 1952 for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. Monks was born at Keynsham, Somerset.Monks made 65 first-class appearances, scoring 1,589 runs @ 18.91 with a highest innings of 120, his sole century in addition to 7 half-centuries. He held 32 catches and took 36 wickets @ 45.25 with a best analysis of 4\u201370.Monks died at Coalpit Heath, Bristol on 23 January 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Clifford Monks (1935\u20131952) : C.
