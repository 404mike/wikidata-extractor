With Beatles manager Brian Epstein, he co-owned Brydor Cars in the 1960s, supplying sportscars to many figures in the Swinging London era, including the Beatles and members of the Rolling Stones and the Moody Blues. In 1967, he became the manager of Apple Publishing, the first appointment in the Beatles' Apple Corps business organisation. He also managed the Apple artists Grapefruit and Mary Hopkin. He was a personal assistant to John Lennon and then George Harrison. Throughout the 1970s, he worked as Harrison's estate manager at Friar Park in Oxfordshire and assisted in restoring the property.\nDoran first met the Beatles in Liverpool, through Epstein, and sold the band their first car, as well as the van in which they travelled to gigs around the North of England. He relocated to London in 1963 when they moved south to capitalise on their national breakthrough. He remained among the group's inner circle, along with other friends from Liverpool who went on to work at Apple, and was a trusted confidant to each of the band members. He is often cited as the inspiration behind the line \"Meeting a man from the motor trade\" in the Beatles' 1967 song \"She's Leaving Home\", although Paul McCartney later denied the story. Doran died of COVID-19 aged 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Strawberry Fields Forever", "response": ["After recording the second version of the song, Lennon wanted to do something different with it. Martin recalled: \"He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) ...\" For this purpose, another basic track was recorded on 8 and 9 December, with the group attempting the song at a faster tempo than before. At the start of the first session, recording was overseen by Dave Harries, an EMI technical engineer, in the temporary absence of Martin and Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' usual recording engineer. The band focused on achieving a percussion-heavy rhythm track, which included Starr's drums, and backwards-recorded hi-hat and cymbals. The latter process involved writing down the parts before Starr played them, as Harrison had done for his backwards guitar solo on \"I'm Only Sleeping\". Described by Winn as a \"cacophony of noise\", the 8 December tape also included timpani and bongos, played by McCartney and Harrison, and other percussion, which, in Harries' account, was provided by Beatles associates Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall and Terry Doran."]}, {"page": "A Day in the Life", "response": ["The story had been sold to the Daily Mail in Manchester by Ron Kennedy of the Star News agency in Blackburn. Kennedy had noticed a Lancashire Evening Telegraph story about road excavations and in a telephone call to the Borough Engineer's department had checked the annual number of holes in the road. Lennon had a problem with the words of the final verse, however, not being able to think of how to connect \"Now they know how many holes it takes to\" and \"the Albert Hall\". His friend Terry Doran suggested that the holes would \"fill\" the Albert Hall, and the lyric was eventually used."]}, {"page": "With a Little Help from My Friends", "response": ["The Beatles began recording the song on 29 March 1967, the day before they posed for the Sgt. Pepper album cover. They recorded 10 takes of the song, wrapping up sessions at 5:45 in the morning. The backing track consisted of Starr on drums, McCartney playing piano, Harrison playing lead guitar and Lennon beating a cowbell. At dawn, Starr trudged up the stairs to head home \u2013 but the other Beatles cajoled him into doing his lead vocal then and there, standing around the microphone for moral support.  The following day they added tambourine, backing vocals, bass and more electric guitar. American TeenSet editor Judith Sims interviewed each Beatle separately on the 29th as they became available. Others in the studio at various times included roadies Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, publicists Tony Barrow and Terry Doran, photographers Leslie Bryce and Frank Herrmann, and Cynthia Lennon."]}, {"page": "Mary Hopkin", "response": ["The next single was \"Goodbye\", written by McCartney (credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney), and released on 26 March 1969. It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 15 on the RPM chart in Canada. Hopkin said she interpreted \"Goodbye\" as McCartney pledging to stop \"micromanaging\" her career, since she was uncomfortable with his positioning of her as a pop chanteuse. She also expressed dissatisfaction with her manager at this time, Terry Doran."]}, {"page": "Apple Corps", "response": ["Apple's music publishing arm predated the record company. In September 1967, the first artistes to be signed by Apple Publishing were two songwriters from Liverpool. Paul Tennant and David Rhodes were offered a contract after meeting McCartney in Hyde Park. They were advised to form a band by Epstein after he and Lennon heard their demos, calling the group Focal Point. Epstein was to have managed the band but died before he could become involved. Terry Doran MD of Apple Publishing became their manager and they were signed by Deram Records. Apple published the group's self-penned songs from early 1968. Another early band on its publishing roster was the group Grapefruit."]}, {"page": "Live Peace in Toronto 1969", "response": ["On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon, who was still a member of the Beatles, to ask him to be the master of ceremonies for the festival. Instead, Lennon offered to perform at the show with a new group, the Plastic Ono Band.Lewisohn 2000, p. 332\" Brower readily agreed, but since Lennon did not actually have a new group, he quickly began making phone calls to potential members to accompany himself and Yoko Ono. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling him and only believed that the real John Lennon was on the phone when he called a second time."]}, {"page": "Dark Horse (George Harrison album)", "response": ["The LP's gatefold cover design was credited to Tom Wilkes and includes photography by Terry Doran,Harry, p. 143. a long-time friend of the Beatles and Harrison's original estate manager at Friar Park.Clayson, p. 319.George Harrison, p. 71fn.

Their brand of music was a typical late 1960s blend of rock, which they often fused with psychedelic effects such as phasers and vocoders, or classical arrangements.", "Before the next single could be released, RCA dropped the band in the UK, and the new head of Apple Publishing, Mike O'Connor, released the group from its Apple contracts, (except for the original publishing contract with George Alexander), and Terry Doran (still managing Grapefruit) signed the band directly to Equinox.  Terry Melcher then resumed producing Grapefruit, including re-mixing or re-recording earlier songs (for which Apple was willing to supply the tapes), but the Lennon-McCartney version of \"Lullaby\" was still not released."]}, {"page": "Alexander Young (musician)", "response": ["Young was signed as songwriter with Apple Music Publishing Ltd. by Terry Doran, managing director of Apple Publishing, friend of the Beatles, and later manager of Grapefruit, during the summer of 1967.

With its reference to roads and the UK's Highway Code, \"Everybody, Nobody\" has been described by musical biographer Simon Leng as Harrison's first \"motoring\" song.Leng, p. 95.

The two sections describing the spiritual world serve as the song's middle eightsHuntley, p. 92. and use a more gentle melody backed by Indian instrumentation.Greene, p. 195. In Leng's view, these sections recall Harrison's 1967 composition \"Within You Without You\". While remarking on how Harrison's lyrics from his 1973 album Living in the Material World \"resembled Vedic sutras\", author Joshua Greene writes that in the song \"Living in the Material World\", he \"condensed a lengthy passage from the Bhagavad Gita into a dozen simple words\".Greene, pp. 194\u201395."]}, {"page": "His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)", "response": ["By 1973, SellersClayson, pp. 333\u201334. and MilliganOlivia Harrison, pp. 322, 362. were among the comedians who formed part of Harrison's social circle at his Friar Park estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.Carol Clerk, \"George Harrison 1943\u20132001\", Uncut, February 2002, p. 56; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).
