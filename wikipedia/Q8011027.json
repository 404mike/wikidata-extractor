Slade was awarded by a jury \u00a323,000 as compensation (a sum considered high at the time), and the whole of the old building was removed and new rooms erected, on the east side of Regent Street at the north-west corner of Argyll Place. The new building was designed by Nash: on the side next Regent Street was a balcony supported by eight caryatids. The group by whom it was erected were 21 of the prominent London musicians in London, who had formed the Royal Harmonic Institution to publish music. This organisation occupied, for the purposes of its trade, the southwestern angle of the new building (at the corner of Regent Street and Argyll Place), circular with a domed roof. The cost of the building, with other factors, soon led to the withdrawal of most of the original investors, at a loss of about \u00a31800 each, and the place eventually fell into the hands of two of them, Thomas Welsh and William Hawes. They then fell out, and ultimately Hawes, by an act of bankruptcy, forced a dissolution of the partnership, and the concern then remained in the hands of Welsh alone."]}, {"page": "William Hawes (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Hawes was an English musician.", "William Hawes may also refer to:", "*William Hawes (physician) (1736\u20131808), English founder of the Royal Humane Society", "*William Hawes (1805\u20131885), English businessperson and reformer, grandson of the physician"]}, {"page": "Hawes, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Hawes"]}, {"page": "Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal", "response": ["* 1817 William Hawes"]}, {"page": "Gentleman of the Chapel Royal", "response": ["* William Hawes"]}, {"page": "Musical Antiquarian Society", "response": ["Among members of the council not included in the above list were Sir John Goss, Sir W.
