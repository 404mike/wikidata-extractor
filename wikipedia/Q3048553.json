The film is \"glorious fun as it grows increasingly implausible\", for the plot \"is all historical rubbish\".. Damon Wise, reviewing the film for The Guardian, appraises Emmerich's \"meticulously crafted\" and \"stunningly designed takedown of the Bard\", as shocking only in that it is rather good. Emmerich's problem, he argues, is that he was so intent on proving his credentials as a serious director that the film ended up \"drowned in exposition\". Orloff's screenplay heavily confuses plotlines; the politics are retrofitted to suit the theory. The lead roles are \"unengaging\" but special mention is given to Edward Hogg's performance as Robert Cecil, and Vanessa Redgrave's role as Elizabeth.."]}]}}
