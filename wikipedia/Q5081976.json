He made his highest score of 77 in his third match for the club, an innings victory over Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Hind continued to play steadily in the upper-middle order for most of the rest of the 1876 season. At the start of the  1877 season, Hind hit a rough patch in his batting form, and was at times replaced in the batting order by Charles Regan. However he achieved his best bowling performance with 4-9 against MCC and managed an innings of 43 against Hampshire in his penultimate first-class fixture."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1877", "response": ["The captain for the year was Robert Smith.
