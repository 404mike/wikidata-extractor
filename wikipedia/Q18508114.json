In September 1838 the wrecking of the steamship Forfarshire off the Northumberland coast with the loss of 62 lives and a heroic rescue of five of the nine survivors by lighthouseman William Brook Darling and his daughter Grace Horsley Darling became a national sensation. Parker saw a commercial opportunity and enlisted the talents of his friend John Wilson Carmichael (1800\u20131868) \u2013 an artist specialising in marine subjects \u2013 to work collaboratively on a painting that was to be known as William and Grace Darling Going to the Rescue of the SS Forfarshire.Carmichael had a studio near Parker\u2019s in Brunswick Place. He made his debut at the Royal Academy in 1835 with a picture of a similar subject, Saving the Crew of a Wreck \u2013 scene Scarborough. This work and his 1838 painting Shipping in the Open Sea owe a stylistic debt to J. M. W. Turner\u2019s The Ship Wreck of 1805. They paid four fishermen to row them to the Longstone Lighthouse, the home of the Darlings.  Carmichael was taken beyond the lighthouse to sketch the wreckage, while Parker stayed for most of a week making watercolour studies and portraits.The resultant painting is now owned and displayed by the RNLI Grace Darling Museum, Bamburgh. The project generated press coverage, and Parker supplemented the collaborative painting with two further related paintings. The set were engraved by David Lucas(1802\u20131881) and became very popular and well known.The mezzotint, also known as The Rescue on the 7th September, 1838, on the Farne Islands of the Nine Survivors of the Wreck of the Steam Packet Forfarshire, was published on the first anniversary of the tragedy by Francis Moon, London. In 1853 it was reprinted by Thomas Boys, London.  A letter from Parker to Lucas in Newcastle City Libraries, dated 26 April 1839, shows Parker\u2019s concern to ensure that the engraving captured the \u2018somewhat Bonaparte character\u2019 of Grace Darling's face.

The Examiner described it as having \u2018a more exact look of nature than any picture we have ever seen by an Englishman\u2019. It acquired a buyer in the loyal John Fisher, who purchased the painting for 100 Guineas, a price he himself thought too low.  He gifted the painting to his solicitor and friend John Pern Tinney. Tinney loved the painting and offered Constable another 100 Guineas to paint a companion picture, Constable declined. In the years to follow Tinney would have to put up with numerous requests from Constable to borrow back his prized possession for rework and exhibitions.National Gallery: Stratford Mill After Tinney's death David Lucas produced a mezzotint, which was published in 1840 under the name \u2018The Young Waltonians\u2019 in reference to the Izaak Walton book, The Compleat Angler.National Gallery: Stratford Mill"]}, {"page": "James Alphege Brewer", "response": ["Brewer and his wife Florence Lucas lived on Avenue Road in Acton throughout their marriage.
