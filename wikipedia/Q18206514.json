Because Government funding was prioritised for the similar Forth Road Bridge (opened in 1964), construction of the Severn Bridge was not started until 1961: the UK government announced in 1962 that construction costs would be recovered by a toll of 2s\u00a06d (\u00a30.125) on all vehicle crossings, though walking or cycling across the bridge would be charge-free.
