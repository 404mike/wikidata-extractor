He appeared once on the tour against Sri Lanka A. No first-class appearances came in the 1998 English cricket season, it was in 1999 what he played his second and final first-class match for Essex against Cambridge University.His three first-class matches bought him little success with the ball, with Powell taking just a single first-class wicket (that of Leicestershire's David Millns).

He had a little more success with the ball in this format, claiming 4 wickets in his 6 matches at an average of 31.25, with best figures of 2/10.Eventually leaving Essex at the end of the 2000 season, Powell played a single match for the Surrey Cricket Board in the 2001 MCCA Knockout Trophy against Oxfordshire.
