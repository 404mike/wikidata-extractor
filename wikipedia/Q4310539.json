Comparing the LSO of 2004 with the orchestra of the 1960s and 1970s, Murphy said, \"Now the strings have improved so much, the playing is fantastic, but it has lost something of its gung-ho quality.\"Quoted in Morrison, p. 187 The orchestra of the 1960s had a reputation for tormenting conductors it disliked; even such notorious martinets as George Szell were given a hard time.Morrison, p. 123 By the 21st century the orchestra had long abandoned such aggression; civilities were maintained even with conductors whom the orchestra took against: they were simply never re-engaged.Morrison, p. 124"]}, {"page": "Black Dyke Band", "response": ["* Maurice Murphy, principal cornet"]}, {"page": "List of trumpeters", "response": ["* Maurice Murphy "]}, {"page": "Denis Wick", "response": ["He held the position of principal trombone at the London Symphony Orchestra from 1957\u20131988.

According to pianist Steve Boudreau, the main chord progression is a variant of the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart staple \"My Funny Valentine\", with both songs relying on a minor chord with all the harmonic motion in the upper voice. In \"My Funny Valentine\" it descends chromatically from the root, while in \"Isobel\" it forms more of a circle. Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive pace, with Pulse!'s Tom Lanham describing it as \"lazy [and] unassuming\", like \"a camel making its way across the desert\", and Rolling Stones Lorraine Ali writing the song \"snakes along like a patient desert caravan\". Maurice Murphy's trumpet opens the piece, followed by Deodato's lush string arrangements and Hooper's sound effects which Bj\u00f6rk has described as \"jungle-istic\".
