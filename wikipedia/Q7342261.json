He also lectures in the controversial subject of the European Civil War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World War I reparations", "response": ["Several historians take the middle ground between condemning reparations and supporting the argument that they were not a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, \"Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy\" as had been feared, however the \"psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system\". P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a \"strain on the German balance of payments\", they could be paid and were \"compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry\". According to Martel, Robert Boyce said reparations were \"a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge\u00a0...\u00a0and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments\". However, he says that while \"Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations\" this was far from the truth, and that \"\u00a0...\u00a0Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad\". William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, \"an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt\". However, Charles Feinstein writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans \"to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries\". Feinstein says that \"even if the economic aspects\u00a0...\u00a0were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany\"."]}, {"page": "European Civil War", "response": ["The central proponents of the European Civil War were originally based at the history department of the London School of Economics. In his 1996 work The Republic Besieged: Civil War in Spain 1936\u20131939, Paul Preston describes the Spanish Civil War as an \"episode in a greater European Civil War that ended in 1945\". The department even included the subject as a course in its own right (taught by Dr. Robert Boyce).\"LSE Course Guide, 2004-2005\".
