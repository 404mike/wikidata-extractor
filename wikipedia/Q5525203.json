A midfielder, he scored 15 goals in 292 league appearances in a 12-year career in the Football League with Sheffield United, Leeds United, Bristol City, and Port Vale. He retired as a player in March 1988, and after a brief spell coaching at Port Vale he took up work as a financial adviser.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1986\u201387 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a 2\u20132 draw at crisis club Middlesbrough, who were forced to play the fixture at Hartlepool, after finding themselves kicked out of Ayresome Park. Vale also drew their opening home match the following week against Rotherham United, and Grew was forced off with a knee injury and Alan Webb split his shinbone. Jim Arnold agreed to return to the club on non-contract terms to replace the injured Grew. Playing a 'fluent, passing game', Vale defeated bogey-team Walsall, who had maintained a 21-game unbeaten league run against the \"Valiants\" since 1965. Ageing Arnold failed to maintain his fitness and Vale struggled around the foot of the table. Rudge signed 'giant' Alex Williams on loan from Manchester City. Despite Andy Jones leading the scoring charts, Vale still suffered, and Rudge's attempts to sign Steve Bull from West Bromwich Albion failed. On 9 November, Vale Park hosted an American football match, in which Locomotive Derby beat the Stoke Spitfires 13\u20138. By the end of the month Vale were cut four points adrift at the bottom of the league. The next month John Williams was sold to Bournemouth for \u00a330,000, having been in poor form for Vale. Rudge then splashed out \u00a35,000 on Bristol City's Gary Hamson. He also brought Bob Hazell in from Reading on a free transfer.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gary Hamson", "|\u2013||MF||||Gary Hamson||1||0||0||0||1", "| December 1986 || MF ||  || Gary Hamson || Bristol City || \u00a35,000 || "]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Rumours of a Rudge exit from Vale Park came after Alan Oakes quit in protest after being demoted to youth coach, and 'taskmaster' Mike Pejic was promoted in his place. Nevertheless, he signed Gary Ford from Leicester City for \u00a336,000, whilst Pearson had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. Michael Cole also arrived on loan from Ipswich Town. Rudge switched from a formation of 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133 and only one defeat followed in the next thirteen league games. As Barnes returned to Manchester, Richard O'Kelly was transferred to Walsall. Cole was replaced by another loanee Dean Holdsworth (from Watford), who found greater success with Vale. However Gary Hamson was forced to retire through injury. A 5\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers on 2 April helped the Vale into tenth place, giving Vale a faint hope of reaching the play-offs. Vale ended the season poorly however, winning just two of their final nine games.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Gary Hamson", "|\u2013||MF||||Gary Hamson||2||1||0||0||3", "| March 1988 || MF ||  || Gary Hamson || colspan=\"2\"| Retired|| "]}, {"page": "Hamson, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Hamson"]}]}}
