She was associated with the Norwich School of painters, Britain's first provincial art movement. Along with her niece Eloise Harriet Stannard, she is considered to be the most accomplished British female still life artist of the 19th century.\nStannard was born in Norwich of artistic parents. In 1820, she travelled with her father  Daniel Coppin to the Netherlands to study the paintings of Jan van Huysum and other Dutch masters, an episode which influenced her artistic style. She married the Norwich artist Joseph Stannard in 1826, but was widowed four years later. She painted until she was in her eighties, mainly depicting paintings of flowers in vases, fruit or game animals. She exhibited in both Norwich and London, and was awarded a large gold medal in 1820 for an original painting of flowers, and two further gold medals in later years. She became  an honorary member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1831. Her works were favourably received by the local press during her lifetime, and in recent decades, art historians have praised the highly finished appearance of her paintings and her use of colour.\nThe largest collection of works by Stannard are held by the Norfolk Museums Collections, based at Norwich Castle. Her works were shown at an exhibition of paintings by her family held in Norwich in 1934, and she was among those women artists featured in 2018 and 2019, at the exhibition Visible Women at Norwich Castle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["*Emily Stannard (Emily Coppin)"]}, {"page": "Joseph Stannard", "response": ["thumb|left|Joseph and Emily Stannard's home in Norwich |alt=photograph of the Stannard family home"]}, {"page": "James Sillett", "response": ["Of their five children, three died in infancy.
