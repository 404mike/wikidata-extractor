The two wharfs, known as the French and English Hatoba, were too shallow for the ocean going ships to dock, and so barges were used to carry passengers and freight to and from the ships in the outer harbour.  In 1894, the Japanese government provided funding for an extended steel pier to replace the English Hatoba.  Designed by British engineer, Henry Spencer Palmer, the new pier was able to accommodate up to four ships simultaneously."]}, {"page": "Richard Mayne (explorer)", "response": ["In 1856 Lieutenant Mayne was attached to the Nautical Survey of Vancouver Island and British Columbia. Mayne sailed with Captain George Henry Richards on his expedition in HMS Plumper and also on HMS Hecate to survey the coast of British Columbia (1857\u20131859), and there came to serve in the Royal Engineers under Colonel Richard Moody and was assigned the exploration and mapping of hitherto unknown parts of the colony.  His journal of these activities is a classic source of British Columbia history, as are those of his Royal Engineer colleague Lieutenant Henry Spencer Palmer. Mayne Island in the Gulf Islands is named after him, and Hecate Strait for his vessel. For this work, in 1860, he was promoted to Commander and returned to England.Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xxxi, p.297, and vol. xxxii, p123 In 1862 he was appointed to the command of HMS Eclipse, for service in New Zealand, and took part in the New Zealand Wars until severely wounded in 1863 and invalided home. For these services he was mentioned in despatches and promoted to the rank of Captain; and in 1867 received the Companionship of the Bath.Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society: Obituary, p.473-5"]}, {"page": "Palmer (surname)", "response": ["*Henry Spencer Palmer (1838\u20131893), British army military engineer and surveyor"]}, {"page": "Henry Palmer", "response": ["*Henry Spencer Palmer (1838\u20131893), British army military engineer and surveyor"]}, {"page": "General Palmer", "response": ["*Henry Spencer Palmer (1838\u20131893), British Army major general"]}, {"page": "Aoyama Cemetery", "response": ["* Henry Spencer Palmer (1838\u20131893) British engineer and journalist."]}]}}
