Until 1952, it was the only regularly-published journal in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.During the 1930s, the first generation of Sudanese graduates from the Gordon Memorial College founded journals partly in response. These include al-Fajr (established 1934) and al-Nahda (established 1930). See  The idea for the journal was suggested by the Director of Survey, Lt. Col. Milo Talbot, to Edgar Bonham-Carter (later Sir), then the Legal Secretary of the Sudan government. Talbot felt that \"year by year much valuable information was lost or buried in inaccessible files because there was no convenient medium for recording it in the country.\" This was a problem that might be corrected with a journal. Bonham-Carter took the proposal to J.W. Crowfoot, the Director of the Education Department, and a meeting chaired by Sir Lee Stack was held where it was decided to start a journal. Stack became the Journal's patron. After the death of Stack, Geoffrey Archer took on the role of patron."]}, {"page": "Bethnal Green North East (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| Edgar Bonham-Carter"]}]}}
