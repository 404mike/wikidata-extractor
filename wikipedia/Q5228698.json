There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the Flamingo Club in London. According to Anderson, \"Mick was coming down the stairs ... and we were going up and I said, `Mick, this is my friend, Ian [Hunter] Patterson.'\" The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording \"To Make a Man Cry,\" but not the B-side, \"Thread of Time.\" John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of The Merseybeats, played on the record. Johnny Gustafson was also included in the session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium."]}, {"page": "Whatevershebringswesing", "response": ["* Dave Dufort \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 4\u20135)"]}, {"page": "Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes", "response": ["*Dave Dufort / drums on \"Stars\""]}, {"page": "Tytan (band)", "response": ["Tytan is a British heavy metal band formed at the height of the new wave of British heavy metal in the autumn of 1981 by the former Angel Witch rhythm section, bassist Kevin Riddles and drummer Dave Dufort (ex-E.\u00a0F.
