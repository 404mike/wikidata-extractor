This was a challenge to mainstream assumptions of 20th century research, especially to those that justified looking for origins of consciousness in evolution. It was also a challenge to the behaviorists, who, \"under the tutelage of John Watson, solved the problem of consciousness by ignoring it.\" What they had 'ignored' were the problems of introspection and the weaknesses of introspectionist methods of 19th century psychologists. Those 20th century thinkers who questioned the existence of introspection never doubted the existence of sense perception, however; they clearly distinguished between the two. On the other hand, in later years Jaynes's approach had become \"radical\" for emphasizing the distinction. Jaynes differed with those who ignored it, for example Stuart Sutherland, who simply defined consciousness as 'awareness'.  Jaynes acknowledged that his whole argument was \"contradictory to the usual and [...] superficial views of consciousness\", and he insisted that \"the most common error\" people make \"is to confuse consciousness with perception.\""]}, {"page": "Telepathy", "response": ["Psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote that cases of telepathy can be explained by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland, \"most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes think the same thought at the same time.\"Sutherland, Stuart. (1994). Irrationality: The Enemy Within. p. 314. Penguin Books.  Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.Graham Reed. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience. Prometheus Books. pp. 38-42.

Similarly, renowned scholars like Marcus Cunliffe, Gabriel Josipovici, Quentin Bell, Dame Helen Wallace, Stuart Sutherland and Marie Jahoda also became central figures at the university and founded many of its current departments.

On the other hand, confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict.
