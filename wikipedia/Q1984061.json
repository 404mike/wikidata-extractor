Entering a bedroom, she enters a wardrobe for a few minutes and begins to steal jewellery before Matthew Bellamy and Christopher Wolstenholme appear playing in the mirrors on the doors either side of her. Before she can see them, they quickly disappear in reality. Standing in front of a giant mirror, she's shocked when Bellamy, Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard emerge, playing only as their reflections. The young woman struggles to cope with seeing them perform in the mirror, clasping her head in frustration and throws an object at the mirror, smashing it. The young boy enters, he sees the room in a mess and then looks behind him. In the mirror, Muse have strangely vanished, and in their place is the girl. The video ends in a still of the boy staring in disbelief at the empty sofa, while in the mirror the girl is sitting on it."]}, {"page": "Plug In Baby", "response": ["*Christopher Wolstenholme \u2013 bass, backing vocals, production, mixing"]}, {"page": "Morgan Nicholls", "response": ["Nicholls began his career with Senseless Things, with whom he released four studio albums between 1989 and 1995.
