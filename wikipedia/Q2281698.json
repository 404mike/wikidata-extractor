He was a boy chorister in the Chapel Royal and by the outbreak of the English Civil War was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. He joined the Royalist cause, in the service of which he rose to the rank of captain. With the Restoration of Charles II he returned to the Chapel Royal as Master of the Children and was responsible for the rebuilding of the chapel and the introduction of instrumental music into the services. The choristers in his charge included his successor and eventual son-in-law Pelham Humfrey, as well as Henry Purcell and John Blow.\nOn reconstituting the choir of the Chapel Royal, Dussuaze states:\n\nA year after the opening of his Majesty's Chapel, the orderers of the music were \"necessitated to supply superior parts of the music with cornets and men's feigned voices, there being not one lad for all that time capable of singing his part readily.\"\nThe conditions soon became better under Cooke's management. On 23 February 1660-1, Pepys mentions Cooke and his boy, apparently Pelham Humfrey, whom he heard make a trial of an anthem for the following day. By November, 1663, the first set was properly trained, and Cooke had already obtained remarkable results. On the 22nd Humfrey's first anthem, \"Have Mercy upon Me, O God,\" was sung in his Majesty's Chapel, and Pepys remarks: \"They say there are four or five of them that can do so much\"; the other four being probably Smith, Blow, Michael Wise, and Tudway or Turner.\nCooke was one of the five English composers who created music for Sir William Davenant's The Siege of Rhodes (1656), often called the first English opera.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Purcell", "response": ["After his father's death in 1664, Purcell was placed under the guardianship of his uncle Thomas, who showed him great affection and kindness. Thomas arranged for Henry to be admitted as a chorister. Henry studied first under Captain Henry Cooke, Master of the Children, and afterwards under Pelham Humfrey, Cooke's successor. The composer Matthew Locke was a family friend and, particularly with his semi-operas, probably also had a musical influence on the young Purcell. Henry was a chorister in the Chapel Royal until his voice broke in 1673 when he became assistant to the organ-builder John Hingston, who held the post of keeper of wind instruments to the King."]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*Henry Cooke"]}, {"page": "Matthew Locke (composer)", "response": ["Locke, with Christopher Gibbons (the son of Orlando), composed the score for Cupid and Death, the 1653 masque by Caroline-era playwright James Shirley.Music In The Baroque Era (From Monteverdi to Bach) - Manfred F Bukofzer - Published by J.M Dent & Sons (First UK Edition 1948) - p186 \"When the masque as a regular court institution fell with Cromwell's rise to power, it was an overripe and doomed form.

Purcell revised the setting up to around 1680, represented in a copied scorebook at Oxford's Christ Church, which was begun by Edward Lowe and continued by Richard Goodson. Other copies of the same version are also difficult to date. In 1681 at the latest, Purcell copied revised versions of other funeral sentences in a book of his collected works, leaving room for Thou knowest but not including it.
