The signings had no immediate impact and Brentford sank to the bottom of the Football League after a 4\u20131 defeat to Scunthorpe United at the Old Showground. The loss meant that Brentford became the first club to occupy both first and last places in the Football League, having risen to top position during the early months of the 1937\u201338 season. Behind the scenes, the Brentford board had split into two factions, with one side pushing for a move to a new stadium and the other half wishing to stay at Griffin Park. Joint-chairmen Les Davey and Walter Wheatley were split on the matter and Wheatley became sole chairman of the club in January 1974, though he would be ousted two months later.", "|Hughie Reed", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Hughie Reed", "| Hughie Reed"]}]}}
