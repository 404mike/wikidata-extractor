In October 2005, the JNF-KKL in Israel split from its British partner, accusing JNF-UK of having \"misled\" the public. The JNF-KKL claimed that the British group was using the KKL name to raise funds \"for their own causes which are not associated with KKL.\" The Israeli JNF-KKL said it would launch a separate fundraising operation in the UK. JNF-UK launched a legal action to stop KKL using the names \"JNF\" or \"Jewish National Fund\" in the UK. The two organisations made peace after the Israeli-born businessman Samuel Hayek took over as JNF-UK chairman in 2008. Israeli JNF-KKL ended its dispute with the JNF-UK within weeks of ending a similar dispute with the American JNF-USA On 1 May 2020 a ruling was issued to JNF on a will writing service encouraging elderly to leave money to KKL. District Judge Geddes noted on KKL's \"lack of independence from JNF UK\" ", "On 2 December 2021, JNF-UK Chairman Samuel Hayek gave an interview to The Jerusalem Post where he expressed concern over rising levels of antisemitism in the UK, claiming that \u201cin 10 years, maybe less, who knows, Jews will not be able to live in the UK.\u201d When asked by Jewish News 18 days later to clarify his reasoning, Hayek claimed the evidence lied in \u201cthe number of immigrants to England. The demographic of British society is changing.\u201d When asked to clarify if the immigrants he was referring to were Muslims, Hayek confirmed this, and went on to claim that Muslim immigrants \u201cdon\u2019t speak English [and] create their own ghettos, their own education, their own process of thinking.\u201d  Hayek appeared to echo sentiments closely associated with far-right great replacement theory when he continued, \u201cthe process is the white Christian majority is shrinking. It shrinks to a degree where there is a point it cannot protect itself anymore.\" Leaders of the Board of Deputies (BoD), the Jewish Leadership Council and the Community Security Trust all condemned Hayek\u2019s comments, as did the Chief Rabbi, while Jewish MP Alex Sobel called for Hayek\u2019s resignation as chair of JNF UK, or the isolation of the JNF UK from communal organisations while Hayek remained in his position. On 4 January 2022 a letter signed by 46 BoD Deputies called for Hayek to resign, stating they would continue to advise synagogues not to participate, support or cooperate with JNF-UK as long as he remained chair. On the 10 January 2022 another letter signed by 105 Jewish student leaders to suspend all programmes run by the JNF UK and to suspend JNF membership from the BoD. On the 13 January 2022 the Charity Commission for England and Wales opened a regulatory case on JNF UK to assess concerns.
