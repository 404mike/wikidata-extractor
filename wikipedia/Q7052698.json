During World War 2, Plummer served with the RAF, serving in the Far East and in Europe as a navigator in the Lancaster bombers. After the war he signed professional forms with Leicester City FC and established himself as a regular in the side at first as centre-forward, but eventually centre-half. He became captain of the side during the 1948/49 season, under John Duncan, and led Leicester City to their first cup final appearance, defeating the favourites Portsmouth F. C. 3\u20131 in the semi-final at Highbury. On 30 April 1949, Norman achieved his childhood dream of captaining Leicester City in their first ever FA Cup Final appearance at Wembley against Wolverhampton Wanderers, led by the great Billy Wright in front of a capacity 100,000 crowd. Leicester were the underdogs against a strong Wolves side, and eventually lost 3\u20131.  After several more seasons at Leicester, Norman eventually moved onto Mansfield Town, and finally ended his career at Kettering Town in the early 1960s.\nOnce he'd retired from football he ran the family shop on Victoria Road East, Leicester for many years until he retired. During his retirement he was a well known member of the RAFA and a regular at Glen Gorse Golf Club. He died on 25 October 1999, after a battle with cancer. He left behind his wife of 50 years Peggy, 3 children Sharon, Adrian and Nigel and 5 grandchildren Leanne, Ashley, Daniel, Justine and Roseanna.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plummer (surname)", "response": ["*Norman Plummer (1924\u20131999), English war hero and footballer", "*Norman Plummer (1924\u20131999), English war hero and footballer "]}, {"page": "1949 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||5 || Norman Plummer (c)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leicester and Leicestershire", "response": ["*Norman Plummer (Leicester City footballer, captain 1949 FA Cup Final, decorated World War II veteran)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 1999", "response": ["*Norman Plummer, 75, British Royal Air Force officer and footballer, cancer."]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Norman Plummer"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Norman Plummer"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Norman Plummer"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Norman Plummer"]}]}}
