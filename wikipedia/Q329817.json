In fact, the dialect in North Yorkshire and Humberside/East Yorkshire is quite different than in West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire and has much stronger Northumbrian and Scandinavian influences.Yorkshire dialect an explanation The Yorkshire Dialect Society draws a border roughly at the River Wharfe between two main zones. The area to the southwest of the river is more influenced by Mercian dialect whilst that to the northeast is more influenced by Northumbrian dialect. The distinction was first made by A. J. Ellis in On Early English Pronunciation.Ellis also identified a third area around Craven, Ribblesdale, upper Wensleydale and Swaledale as part of his \"West Northern\" area (numbered Area 31), alongside almost all of Cumbria as well as north Lancashire and south Durham.  In the tradition of the Yorkshire Dialect Society, this area is usually grouped with the North Riding dialect. The division was approved of by Joseph Wright, the founder of the Yorkshire Dialect Society and the author of the English Dialect Dictionary. Investigations at village level by the dialect analysts Stead (1906), Sheard (1945) and Rohrer (1950) mapped a border between the two areas.The Yorkshire Dialect Border  A rough border between the two areas was mapped by the Swiss linguist Fritz Rohrer, having undertaken village-based research in areas indicated by previous statements by Richard Stead and J.A. Sheard, although there were \"buffer areas\" in which a mixed dialect was used, such as a large area between Leeds and Ripon, and also at Whitgift, near Goole.", "* Th-fronting so that  for  (although Joseph Wright noted th-fronting in the Windhill area in 1892).", "* While is often used in the sense of until (e.g. unless we go at a fair lick, we'll not be home while seven.) Stay here while it shuts might cause a non-local to think that they should stay there during its shutting, when the order really means that they should stay only until it shuts. Joseph Wright wrote in the English Dialect Dictionary that this came from a shortening of the older word while-ever.", "The Yorkshire society is the oldest of the county dialect societies; it grew out of the committee of workers formed to collect material for the English Dialect Dictionary. The committee was formed in October 1894 at Joseph Wright's suggestion and the Yorkshire Dialect Society was founded in 1897. It publishes an annual volume of The Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society; the contents of this include studies of English dialects outside Yorkshire, e.g. the dialects of Northumberland, and Shakespeare's use of dialect.Brook, G.
