He played in nine Test matches but was never picked for a home Test or for an Ashes tour. However, for the best part of three decades he was a vital member of a generally struggling Leicestershire team. With no amateur able to play frequently for the county, Astill became the first officially appointed professional captain of any county for over fifty years in 1935. The county enjoyed a useful season, but at forty-seven years of age, Astill was only a stop gap before an amateur of the required standard and availability could be found. He was a nephew of Leicestershire fast bowler Thomas Jayes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 1", "response": ["*1888 \u2013 Ewart Astill, English cricketer and billiards player (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "1888", "response": ["* March 1\u00a0\u2013 Ewart Astill, English cricketer (Leicestershire) (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["In 1945 he went to Alf Gover's Cricket School for three weeks and his father enrolled him at Tonbridge School where he could qualify for Kent, Gover telling the Tonbridge coach Ewart Astill that Cowdrey should join the First XI immediately, a rarity for first year pupils.
