He won an Olympic silver medal in the 4\u00d7100 metres relay at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He was the 200 m gold medallist at the 1982 Commonwealth Games and a 60 metres gold medallist at the 1985 European Athletics Indoor Championships. McFarlane won two further sprint medals at the 1986 Commonwealth Games.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allan Wells", "response": ["In 1982, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Wells won two more Commonwealth titles in the 100 m, a wind assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a bronze medal in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with Mike McFarlane of England in a rare dead heat."]}, {"page": "Dwain Chambers", "response": ["Chambers transitioned into the senior ranks soon after, taking the 100\u00a0m silver medal behind his British teammate Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with a run of 10.03\u00a0s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100\u00a0m semi finalist and set a games record as part of the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay team.'I thought I'd won' . Sports Illustrated (21 September 1998). Retrieved on 5 May 2009.Commonwealth Games Records . Commonwealth Games official website. Retrieved on 5 May 2009. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100\u00a0m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99\u00a0s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98\u00a0s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.", "Chambers' coach Mike McFarlane struggled with the workload of full-time training. Frustrated by the distance between himself and the top sprinters, Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the run up to the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200\u00a0m personal best of 20.27\u00a0s in Athens on 10 June 2002.All results, times, personal bests, records, medals or other achievements flagged with an \"x\" label were nullified from the record by the IAAF as they were achieved while Chambers was using banned substances. Montgomery, impressed by Chambers' training regime, tipped the Briton to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.", "Chambers announced that he was to part with trainer Mike McFarlane in favour of a permanent relationship with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny. The sprinter started the 100\u00a0m season modestly, finishing third and fourth in|Modesto and Eugene, respectively. Chambers beat Montgomery in Glasgow in June, running a stadium record of 10.15\u00a0s into a headwind, and qualified for the World Championships by winning the AAA trials."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|  Elliot Bunney John Regis Linford ChristieMike McFarlaneClarence Callender* ||38.28"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Mike McFarlane"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1988 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* John Regis, Elliot Bunney, Linford Christie, and Mike McFarlane \u2014 Athletics, Men's 4\u00d7100 metres Relay"]}, {"page": "1986 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Elliot BunneyDaley Thompson Mike McFarlaneLinford Christie||38.71"]}, {"page": "Julian Golding", "response": ["Golding was born in Harlesden, North West London.
