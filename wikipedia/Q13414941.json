His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "Salford City F.C.", "response": ["They began their first season in the league with a 2\u20130 win against Stevenage, with both goals coming from Dieseruvwe.

They achieved their first away victory in the Football League on 5 October, when goals from Luke Armstrong, Jake Jervis, and Touray gave the club a 3\u20130 win against Walsall. Later in the season, the club would reach the EFL Trophy Final after defeating Newport County via a penalty shootout, where they were due to play League One side Portsmouth; the game was postponed indefinitely following the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In June, the league season was officially cut short after League Two clubs voted by an \"overwhelmingly majority\", with the league table to be decided on a points per game basis, meaning Salford finished their d\u00e9but season in the Football League in 11th. Later that month, Salford took the decision to scrap their Under 18 team, deciding to focus exclusively on the development squad. Phil Neville said that the reason was both financial and because lower-league clubs could not attract the best youth players, and that the club would have a better chance developing 18 to 20 year olds under Warren Joyce."]}, {"page": "List of foreign S\u00fcper Lig players", "response": ["*Jake Jervis \u2013 Elaz\u0131\u011fspor 2012\u201313"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["175px|thumb|Jake Jervis, 2011", "* Jake Jervis (born 1991) \u2013 professional footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Jake Jervis"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 27 ||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jake Jervis"]}, {"page": "Sein\u00e4joen Jalkapallokerho", "response": ["After the season SJK appointed Jani Honkavaara as the new head coach.
