A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987\u201388 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy a good relationship with the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988\u201389 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds went on to win promotion in 1990."]}, {"page": "Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC", "response": ["| Bobby Davison"]}, {"page": "Craig Short", "response": ["In September 2008, it was announced that Short had joined Sheffield United's sister club, Ferencvaros, as a player-coach to Bobby Davison.
