Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts. The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, A Pagan Place, in June 1984. The \"official\" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of A Pagan Place, was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others.", "Roddy Lorimer's participation began in 1983, contributing his trumpet playing \"on and off\" until 1990. He and Thistlethwaite took turns leading the brass section of the band, and Lorimer was also a featured soloist, most famously on \"The Whole of the Moon\" and \"Don't Bang the Drum\". He further contributed backing vocals to the song. His trumpet style is a combination of his classical training with an experimental approach encouraged by Scott. Lorimer returned for some studio work in 2006."]}, {"page": "The Great Escape (Blur album)", "response": ["* Roddy Lorimer \u2013 trumpet"]}, {"page": "Steel Wheels", "response": ["*Roddy Lorimer \u2013 trumpet (3)"]}, {"page": "A Pagan Place", "response": ["A Pagan Place was an album released in June 1984 by The Waterboys.

Band members Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Karl Wallinger, Chris Whitten, and Roddy Lorimer performed the new material.  Wallinger's home studio heard demo recordings for a number of the album's songs.  Some of the recordings, like the ones of the last two albums, are relatively untouched by studio engineering.  On other recordings, however, Scott added a drum machine and layered the sound, using a studio technique similar to that of the famous record producer Phil Spector, with help from Wallinger.  \"Having Karl [Wallinger] in the studio\", writes Scott, \"was like having a one-man orchestra around.  There might have been a This Is the Sea without him, but it wouldn't have been the same \u2013 or as good\".
