The Emily Wilson translation depicts Hephaestus demanding/imploring Zeus before Poseidon offers, however, leading the reader to assume Zeus did not give back the \"price\" Hephaestus paid for \"his daughter\" and was thus why Poseidon intervened.

Emily Wilson, a professor of classical studies at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that, as late as the first decade of the 21st century, almost all of the most prominent translators of Greek and Roman literature had been men. She called her experience of translating Homer one of \"intimate alienation.\" Wilson writes that this has affected the popular conception of characters and events of the Odyssey, inflecting the story with connotations not present in the original text: \"For instance, in the scene where Telemachus oversees the hanging of the slaves who have been sleeping with the suitors, most translations introduce derogatory language (\"sluts\" or \"whores\") [...] The original Greek does not label these slaves with derogatory language.\" In the original Greek, the word used is hai, the feminine article, equivalent to \"those female people\"."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["*Emily Wilson"]}, {"page": "The Bacchae", "response": ["* Emily Wilson, 2016: verseWilson, Emily, Greek Plays (Modern Library 2016)"]}, {"page": "The Trojan Women", "response": ["| Emily Wilson"]}, {"page": "Helen (play)", "response": ["*Emily Wilson, 2016 - verse"]}, {"page": "Electra (Euripides play)", "response": ["*Emily Wilson, 2016 - verse"]}, {"page": "A.

A language is not merely a collection of words and of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences, but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations and cultural references whose mastery, writes linguist Mario Pei, \"comes close to being a lifetime job.\"Mario Pei, The Story of Language, p. 424. The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator\u2014after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures\u2014may require a minimum of ten years' experience. Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them. Emily Wilson, a professor of classical studies at the University of Pennsylvania and herself a translator, writes: \"[I]t is [hard] to produce a good literary translation. This is certainly true of translations of ancient Greek and Roman texts, but it is also true of literary translation in general: it is very difficult. Most readers of foreign languages are not translators; most writers are not translators. Translators have to read and write at the same time, as if always playing multiple instruments in a one-person band. And most one-person bands do not sound very good.\"Emily Wilson, \"Ah, how miserable!\" (review of three separate translations of The Oresteia by Aeschylus: by Oliver Taplin, Liveright, November 2018; by Jeffrey Scott Bernstein, Carcanet, April 2020; and by David Mulroy, Wisconsin, April 2018), London Review of Books, vol. 42, no. 19 (8 October 2020), pp. 9\u201312, 14.
