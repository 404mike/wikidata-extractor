She was originally ordered in 1841 to a design of Sir William Symonds, the Surveyor of the Navy, but was not laid down until May 1849 at Pembroke Dock by which time Symonds had resigned and the design had been modified by the Assistant Surveyor John Edye. At this stage the ship was still intended as a sailing vessel. Although the Royal Navy had been using steam power in smaller ships for three decades, it had not been adopted for ships of the line, partly because the enormous paddle-boxes required would have meant a severe reduction in the number of guns carried. This problem was solved by the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s. Under a crash programme announced in December 1851 to provide the navy with a steam-driven battlefleet, the design was further modified by the new Surveyor, Captain Baldwin Walker. The ship was cut apart in two places on the stocks in January 1852, lengthened by 30\u00a0feet (9.1\u00a0m) overall and given screw propulsion. She received the 780\u00a0hp engines designed and built by Robert Napier and Sons for the iron frigate Simoon, which had surrendered them on conversion to a troopship. The ship was launched on 14 September 1852.

His ships were designed to be faster under sail, and have more room for the gunners to work the guns (improving ergonomics).  To achieve this, his ships were larger, and used a different hull form to provide stability without needing large amounts of ballast.  Unfortunately the Surveyor's department was understaffed for the amount of work they were undertaking, and mistakes were made.  Symonds' designs had more stability than was desirable, with the result that they rolled excessively and therefore were poor gun platforms.  Another problem with Symonds' ships was that they were very sensitive to the distribution of weights on board ship, such as the stores carried and consumed on a voyage.p66-87, Lambert The Last Sailing Battlefleet"]}, {"page": "Albion-class ship of the line (1842)", "response": ["The Albion-class ships of the line were a class of two-deck 90-gun second rates, designed for the Royal Navy by Sir William Symonds.
