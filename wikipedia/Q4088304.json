Kemal was characterized as the founder and sole leader of the nationalist movement.  Potentially negative facts were omitted in the orthodox historiography.  This interpretation had a tremendous impact on the perception of Turkish history, even by foreign researchers. The more recent historiography has come to understand the Kemalist version as a nationalist framing of events and movements leading to the republic's founding.  This was accomplished by sidelining unwanted elements which had links to the detested and genocidal CUP, and thus elevating Kemal and his policies.In the orthodox Turkish version of events, the nationalist movement broke with its defective past and took its strength from popular support led by Kemal, consequently giving him the title Atat\u00fcrk, meaning \"Father of Turks\". According to historians such as Donald Bloxham, E.J. Z\u00fcrcher, and Taner Ak\u00e7am, this was not the case in reality, and a nationalist movement emerged through the backing of leaders of CUP, of whom many were war criminals, people who became wealthy with confiscated equities and they were not on trial for their crimes owing to the accelerating support for the national movement. Kemalist figures, including many old members of the CUP, ended up writing the majority of the history of the war. The modern understanding in Turkey is greatly influenced by this nationalist and politically motivated history."]}, {"page": "Sayfo", "response": ["|Gaunt argues that this figure is most likely an overestimate and \"there is no reliable figure for the Assyrian victims in Persia\".

According to Donald Bloxham, Andranik initiated the change of Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land by destroying Muslim villages and trying to ethnically homogenize key areas of the Armenian state. In late 1918, Azerbaijan accused Andranik of killing innocent Azerbaijani peasants in Zangezur and demanded that he withdraw Armenian units from the area. Antranig Chalabian wrote that, \"Without the presence of General Andranik and his Special Striking Division, what is now the Zangezur district of Armenia would be party of Azerbaijan today. Without General Andranik and his men, only a miracle could have saved the sixty thousand Armenian inhabitants of the Zangezur district from complete annihilation by the Turko-Tatar forces in the fall of 1918\"; he further stated that Andranik \"did not massacre peaceful Tatars\". Andranik's activities in Zangezur were protested by Ottoman general Halil Pasha, who threatened the Dashnak government with retaliation for Andranik's actions.

Mann however states that even if those figures were reduced \"by as much as 50 percent, they still would horrify\".Mann, Michael (2005). The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing. Cambridge University Press. p. 113. . \"In the Balkans all statistics of death remain contested. Most of the following figures derive from McCarthy (1995: 1, 91, 161-4, 339), who is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate. Yet even if we reduced his figures by as much as 50 percent, they would still horrify. He estimates that between 1811 and 1912, somewhere around 5 1/2 million Muslims were driven out of Europe and million more were killed or died of disease or starvation while fleeing. Cleansing resulted from Serbian and Greek independence in the 1820s and 1830s, from Bulgarian independence in 1877, and from the Balkan wars culminating in 1912.\"  Donald Bloxham, a University of Edinburgh historian specializing in genocide studies, states that \"McCarthy's work has something to offer in drawing attention to the oft-unheeded history of Muslim suffering and embattlement... It also shows that vicious nationalism was by no means the sole preserve\" of the Ottoman ruling elite.Bloxham.

Bristol and Joseph Grew endorsed the Turkish nationalist view that the Armenian genocide was a war against the forces of imperialism. In 1922, before receiving the Chester concession, Colby Chester argued that Christians of Anatolia were not massacred; his writing exhibited many of the themes of later genocide denial. In the 1930s, the Turkish embassy scuttled a planned film adaptation of Franz Werfel's popular novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh by the American company MGM, threatening a boycott of American films. Turkish embassies, with the support of the US State Department, shot down attempts to revive the film in the 1950s and 1960s."]}, {"page": "Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia", "response": ["Andrija Artukovi\u0107, the Minister of Interior of the Independent State of Croatia, signed into law a number of racial laws.

Croats and about 750,000 Bosnian Muslims, whose support was needed against the Serbs, were proclaimed Aryans.

The Usta\u0161e introduced the laws to strip Serbs of their citizenship, livelihoods, and possessions. Similar to Jews in the Third Reich, Serbs were forced to wear armbands bearing the letter \u201cP\u201d, for Pravoslavac  (Orthodox). (Likewise, Jews were forced to wear the armband with the letter \"\u017d\", fort \u017didov (Jew). Usta\u0161e writers adopted dehumanizing rhetoric.
