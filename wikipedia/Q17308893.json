When he died in 1882 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners bought the property, intending to profit from development. However, John Runtz and Joseph Beck persuaded the Metropolitan Board of Works to purchase it in 1887, to open it as a public park. The two lakes were named Beckmere and Runtzmere in their honour."]}, {"page": "The Old Church (Stoke Newington)", "response": ["Bull's successor Sidrach Simpson (also master of Pembroke College, Cambridge) resided in the parish but was criticised for letting seats to those outside the parish, failing to carry out repairs to the chancel and expanding his pews into the main body of the church. 1716-1717 saw the addition of a north aisle, followed by an extension to the chancel in 1723, new west windows and a raising of the south walls in 1728, further repairs and a new clock bell in 1770 and a raising of the west end to the same height as the rest of the church in 1785, whilst 18th century curates to the parish included Augustus Clissold. The church's replacement was considered but rejected in 1791, with further restorations in 1806 and 1829, the latter by Charles Barry. 16th-century windows were donated by Jonathan Eade in 1811 and destroyed in bombing in October 1940. The building's tower bells were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry between 1828 and 1864. Struggles between low church and Tractarian factions in the parish in the 19th century culminated in the construction of the new St Mary's Church, opened in 1858. "]}]}}
