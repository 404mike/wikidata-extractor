In addition to parish ministry, he taught at Chichester Theological College and Ripon College Cuddesdon (both Anglican theological colleges). From 1985 to 2013, he was Professor of Liturgy at the University of Notre Dame in the United States.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lumpers and splitters", "response": ["Paul F. Bradshaw suggests that the same principles of lumping and splitting apply to the study of early Christian liturgy. Lumpers, who tend to predominate in this field, try to find a single line of successive texts from the apostolic age to the fourth century (and later). Splitters see many parallel and overlapping strands which intermingle and flow apart so that there is not a single coherent path in the development of liturgical texts. Liturgical texts must not be taken solely at face value; often there are hidden agendas in texts."]}, {"page": "Origin of the Eucharist", "response": ["Paul F. Bradshaw argues in Eucharistic Origins that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper. On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" (Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education)"]}, {"page": "Paul Bradshaw", "response": ["* Paul F. Bradshaw, British professor of liturgy at the University of Notre Dame"]}, {"page": "Lawrence A. Hoffman", "response": ["During the 1990s, he co-edited with Paul F. Bradshaw, a former colleague of his at Notre Dame University, and Janet Walton of Union Theological Seminary a series of five books on the dual liturgical traditions of Christianity and Judaism. The first two books discuss the history of the liturgies and the evolution of worship in Christian and Jewish communities in North America. The final three books were aimed at a more general audience and discuss the meaning of religious holidays, liturgical music and notions of the sacred and the profound."]}, {"page": "Ancient church orders", "response": ["To indicate the way of development of the ancient church orders the term \"living literature\" has been proposed by Bruce M. Metzger and Paul F. Bradshaw (and others) in order to note that these texts, of which only a part survived, were updated and amended generation after generation, mixing ancient parts with materials from the contemporary uses and tradition of the copyists and removing what was no more in line with the current understanding. Moreover, it is probable also that in many cases the copyists were not describing their current or more ancient uses, but what they considered to be the best practice, thus for example describing liturgies never performed. This kind of literature allows the scholars, after a process of evaluation, to look at the liturgies of the 3rd and 4th century, but it makes difficult to use these texts to describe more ancient liturgies."]}, {"page": "Ronald Jasper", "response": ["*With Paul F. Bradshaw, A Companion to the Alternative Service Book, SPCK, 1986."]}, {"page": "Barcelona Papyrus", "response": ["The liturgical scholar Paul F. Bradshaw suggests that this anaphora reached its final form in the 4th century, adding the Sanctus, as well as the Epiclesis and the Institution narrative, to a more ancient material, which could more likely derive from West Syria rather than from Egypt."]}]}}
