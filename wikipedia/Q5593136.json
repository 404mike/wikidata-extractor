Gillingham had hoped for a significantly higher fee, but with the two clubs unable to agree on terms, the transfer fee had to be set by an independent tribunal. Karl Elsey came close to leaving the club, but failed to agree a contract with Reading and so remained at Gillingham. The team prepared for the new season with several friendly matches, including a testimonial match for the long-serving Weatherly, for which Tottenham Hotspur of the First Division provided the opposition.  The team retained the first-choice kit worn in the previous season of blue shirts with a white panel down each side.
