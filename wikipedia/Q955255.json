He failed to persuade Fulham FC chairman Henry Norris to re-locate his club to the ground, and considered selling the land to the Great Western Railway Company, who wished to use it as a coal yard.\nMears was ultimately persuaded not to sell up, and instead decided to found his own team, Chelsea, in March, 1905. The story goes that he was on the verge of giving up on the football project when his Scotch Terrier bit his colleague Fred Parker, who still supported the idea. So impressed was Mears with his friend's reaction, he decided to take his advice.\nMears was on the club's first board of directors, but did not live to see the club achieve any success. His dream of making Stamford Bridge one of England's top stadiums was realised, however, as it staged the FA Cup Final from 1920-22. His descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when his great-nephew Brian sold it to Ken Bates.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.", "Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence, it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5\u00a0acre (51,000\u00a0m2) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.", "Chelsea Football Club were founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for \u00a31. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club \u00a326\u00a0million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players."]}, {"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["During this period, businessman and politician Henry Norris was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals Chelsea. When he rejected an offer from businessman Gus Mears to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium Stamford Bridge is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal. Fulham became the first British team to sell hot dogs at their ground in 1926. Fulham had several high-profile international players during the 1920s, including Len Oliver and Albert Barrett."]}, {"page": "Henry Norris (businessman)", "response": ["A keen football fan, Norris first became a director of Fulham, during which time the Cottagers were elected to the Football League. While chairman of Fulham, Norris had an indirect role in the foundation of nearby Chelsea Football Club.

In 1930 the platforms were lengthened to cope with this extra demand. According to the sports history writer Tim Harris, the station was the inspiration for naming the football club; the entrepreneur and founder of the club, Gus Mears, had considered Stamford Bridge FC, Kensington FC, and London FC, but chose Chelsea FC because of its proximity to Chelsea & Fulham station and in spite of the stadium not actually being located in Chelsea proper."]}, {"page": "Joe Mears", "response": ["Mears was the son and nephew of Chelsea F.C. founders, Joseph and Gus Mears respectively. He was a goalkeeper for the Old Malvernians before joining the Chelsea board in 1931, in doing so becoming the youngest director (aged 26) in the Football League. He became Chelsea chairman in 1940 following the death of Colonel Crisp.

Norris declined following a dispute over the rent; as a result, Mears formed his own club to occupy the ground, Chelsea. Fulham thus had an indirect role in Chelsea's foundation. It also ensured that, despite Chelsea's name, there were two clubs in the Fulham Borough.In 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham was merged with Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith, making possible a \"borough\" derby with neighbouring Queens Park Rangers. The geographical proximity of the teams is the basis for the rivalry, rather than religious or political reasons, as with other derbies."]}, {"page": "Henry Augustus Mears", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gus Mears"]}, {"page": "Mears", "response": ["*Gus Mears (1873\u20131912) (Henry Augustus Mears), English businessman, founder of Chelsea Football Club"]}, {"page": "Bishops Park", "response": ["The meadows had already been protected from flooding by the creation of an embankment; the river wall was built between 1889 and 1893 by Joseph Mears, the father of Chelsea F.C. founders Joseph and Gus Mears."]}, {"page": "History of Fulham F.C.", "response": ["During this period, businessman and politician Henry Norris was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals Chelsea.

Further problems arose when the team were denied entry to the Southern League following objections from Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, so admission to the Football League was applied for. Their candidacy was endorsed at the Football League annual general meeting on 29 May 1905. Scottish international John Robertson was hired as the club's first player-manager, a half-back who would go on to score Chelsea's first competitive goal in a 1-0 win against Blackpool. After this, the club recruited many established players from other teams, including 22 stone goalkeeper William \"Fatty\" Foulke previously of Sheffield United, and forward Jimmy Windridge who came from Small Heath."]}]}}
