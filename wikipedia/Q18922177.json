She worked in maternity hospitals for women refugees and was the president of the British Midwives Institute. Along with being a member of Friends Germany Emergency Committee, Red Cross, and the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees. In 1907, she became Superintendent of District Nurses in London, following her lengthy career in international relief efforts and as a midwife. She died at her home in Somerset in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quakers", "response": ["The Quaker Edith Pye established a national Famine Relief Committee in May 1942, encouraging a network of local famine relief committees, among the most energetic of which was the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, Oxfam. Irving and Dorothy Stowe co-founded Greenpeace with many other environmental activists in 1971, shortly after becoming Quakers."]}, {"page": "Hilda Clark (doctor)", "response": ["Her own WW1 relief work was with her life-long friend Edith Pye, a nurse and midwife, together they founded and ran a maternity hospital at Chalons-sur-Marne from 1914-18. By July 1919 Hilda was in Vienna, to witness the devastation and famine setting up a Quaker Help Mission at #16 Singerstrasse, she was joined by Edith Pye and then a Bertha Bracey in 1921. Bertha Bracey was to become extremely significant subsequently in the Kindertransport. By 1923, Vienna was on its feet and both women became engaged in various relief efforts with Hilda criss-crossing Europe and passing through the Quaker Help Mission in Vienna. As the Nazi regime took on momentum and Austria was  annexed to the Third Reich in the Anschluss (12 March 1938) Hilda became the Co-ordinator of the German Emergency Committee and returned to Vienna to use her expertise and connections, in generating documentations and placements and qualifications for Jewish people to aid their escape.", "As a child, she was involved in athletics and gymnastics. She had a Quaker education at Brighthelmston, at Birkdale in Southport, Lancashire, about 1896\u20137, and The Mount, in York, from about 1897 to 1900, before studying medicine at Birmingham University and the Royal Free Hospital, London where she graduated M.B. and B.S. in 1908. She was the sister of Alice Clark, the feminist and historian and the niece of Annie Clark, one the first pioneering women to formally train in medicine in Britain. Her mother and great-aunts helped to found a number of women's rights organizations in the 1860s. She developed expertise in pulmonary care treating her own sister Alice Clark for TB. During her medical training in Birmingham, she met Edith Pye in 1907-8 where Edith Pye qualified as a nurse and a midwife. This was to become a life-long friendship, which sustained them both.  Hilda's side of the correspondence between them survives, carefully curated by Edith Pye and these letters form the basis of the book \"War and its Aftermath\" published in 1956.  This account is written by a Quaker who has read one side of the original correspondence that survives, the letters from Hilda Clark to Edith Pye, all lovingly preserved and organised and archived in Quaker Archives in London.  It is clear that Edith Pye kept the whole of her side of the correspondence, which runs from 1908 when they met to the outbreak of WWII, when they could only return to England.", "For World War 1, the midwifery expertise of Edith Pye was needed and they went together to the maternity hospital at Chalons, close enough to the western front, to hear the boom of the cannons and from time to time to need to evacuate mothers and babes in arms into the cellars. Hilda was a doctor which informed her organisational and logistic abilities in identifying what was needed and working out how to get it there. There is one harrowing account of a 13-year-old girl, casualty not of the enemy but of drunken soldiers who had raped her, who the whole community of the hospital, mothers and medical staff cared for such that by the time the child was born the young woman was able to take it home.", "There is a letter from Hilda Clark to Edith Pye, taking great delight in the legion d'honneur awarded to Edith Pye, as she commented \"for once it has gone to the right person\". The legion d'honneur is located in the archive of the Royal College of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, of which Edith Pye was the President from 1929-49. Her nursing and midwifery certificates are also located there. In the 1940s she was awarded an OBE for her services to midwifery. Edith Pye became a Quaker by convincement, whereas Hilda Clark was a \"birthright\" Friend and of very historic Quaker stock, but this has tended to mean that she has been given the credit for the work of Edith Pye, and distorted the historical memory with a room named for Hilda Clark at Friends House (London) but not one for Edith Pye who was at least as deserving of recognition. Alice Clark was also a mainstay from England and was an essential part of ensuring the relevant supplies arrived from England.", "After World War I, they returned to England exhausted after their work at the maternity hospital in Chalons-sur-Marne but in 1919, a letter arrived from General Smuts in Vienna, telling them of the catastrophic conditions in the imperial capital of a collapsing empire. General Smuts knew the Clark family through Margaret, an elder sister of Hilda (and Alice) because Margaret Clark has gone to South Africa after the Boer War to organise war relief. General Smuts found himself part of the British occupying forces. It was he who ordered that Allied servicemen should have no greater rations than the Viennese had access to.  Vienna became a magnet for all the ethnic \"Germans\" from all parts of the vast Austrian Empire both bureaucrats and veterans and their families from across the former empire with no homes to return to, in newly independent countries happy to be free of the Austro-Hungarian empire, they all converged on Vienna in a truncated and defeated Austria, prostrate with economic sanctions of the victorious Allies. By the middle of July Hilda Clark was in Paris (with a hat box) working out how to get to Vienna, the only way was via Trieste. By the end of July Hilda wrote to Edith Pye with hand-written letter heading Quaker Help Mission 16 Singerstrasse, District 1 Vienna, in accommodation in the centre of Vienna allocated by the authorities, a building with an extremely ornate frontage. Hilda was to write of the wretchedness of having to eat, while hearing those outside with nothing to eat and described it as worse that the shelling at the western front. The next letter was dated 6 weeks later in September 1919. It was the same address but in German and in the German style and printed and even included a phone number. ", "Her home in London was bombed in 1940 and she moved to Kent, where she was active in the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmens Families Association. She became disabled as a result of Parkinson's disease and returned to Street in 1952, where she died at her home on 24 February 1955 and was buried at the Street Quaker burial ground. Edith Pye continued to live in Street after Hilda's death and herself died in 1965, she was buried under the same headstone."]}, {"page": "Edith Mary Pye", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Pye"]}, {"page": "Ethel Pye", "response": ["Margaret Ethel Pye was one of seven children (four brothers and two sisters) born to Margaret Thompson Kidston, daughter of James Burns Kidston of Glasgow, and William Arthur Pye JP from Exeter, a successful wine merchant and collector of oriental and contemporary art. She was the sister of the bookbinder Sybil Pye, the nurse Edith Pye and the engineer David Randall Pye. The family lived at Marylebone in London, where Ethel Pye grew up, before the family moved to Hampstead, then Surrey."]}, {"page": "Francesca Wilson", "response": ["In 1916, Wilson worked with French evacuee children at Samo\u00ebns in the Haute-Savoie, moving to Corsica the following year with the Serbian Relief Fund. She did similar work with her brother Maurice Wilson in North Africa before moving in February 1919 to distribute food and clothing in Ni\u0161, Grdelica, and Belgrade. Her first book, Portraits and Sketches of Serbia (1920) aimed to publicize Serbia's need for post-war relief. From 1919 to 1922, Wilson worked with Hilda Clark and Edith Pye for the Quaker Relief Mission in Vienna, acting as an interpreter and organizing food depots. After meeting the art educator Franz Ci\u017eek, she organized an exhibition of child art by his pupils, raising money for the recently founded Save the Children Fund. The exhibition toured the UK and the US."]}]}}
