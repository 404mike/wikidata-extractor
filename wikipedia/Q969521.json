One of the most popular illustrators in Victorian Britain, she illustrated 27 books. Her greatest ornithological achievement was the second edition of her Birds from Nature (1868). Most of the illustrations were watercolors, with early paintings often including some ink work. A few were collages, in which she cut out a bird's outline and transferred it to a different background, in a similar manner to John James Audubon. Her many watercolours showed daily family life in the late 19th-century Scottish Highlands as well as fantasy scenes from children's fables. She achieved widespread recognition under the initials JB or her married name Mrs Hugh Blackburn.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Jenner", "response": ["Jenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist Jemima Blackburn, a keen observer of birdlife, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

The children appear in one of the illustrations collecting Jemima's eggs from the rhubarb patch, and their mother is depicted in the opening picture feeding the barnyard fowl. Jemima was based upon a real world duck at Hill Top Farm who evaded Mrs. Cannon and her children in their attempts to locate her eggs before she mismanaged their incubation. Mrs. Cannon believed ducks made poor sitters, and routinely confiscated the ducks' eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Potter may have taken inspiration from a drawing in her father's 1853 sketchbook of a flying duck wearing a bonnet.Taylor 1987, p. 37 Potter almost certainly chose the name \"Jemima\" in honour of Jemima Blackburn, an ornithological painter and illustrator whose Birds from Nature she had received as a gift on her tenth birthday and whom she met in 1891.Lear 2008, p. 222"]}, {"page": "Jemima", "response": ["* Jemima Blackburn (1823\u20131909), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "Posthumous birth", "response": ["| Jemima Blackburn || 1 May 1823 || James Wedderburn || 7 November 1822 || 5 months, 23 days ||"]}, {"page": "List of atheists (miscellaneous)", "response": ["* Jemima Blackburn (1823\u20131909): Scottish painter and illustrator, especially of evocative images of rural life in 19th century Scotland.\"Around their dinner table could be found all shades of political and religious affiliation.

In 1854, Jemima Blackburn, an artist, and her husband, Hugh Blackburn, Professor of mathematics at Glasgow University, bought the Roshven Estate, from Doctor Donald Martin of the Beallach family. Blackburn was noted for capturing the area's scenery, flora and fauna in her nationally famous illustrations. She was particularly adept at painting birds and flowers.

Their homes in Glasgow and at Roshven became a focus for visits from some of the most celebrated figures of the century including John Ruskin, Sir John Everet Millais, Anthony Trollope, the Duke of Argyll, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Lister, Professor Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin and James Clerk-Maxwell, Jemima's first cousin.", "According to the Royal Meteorological Society, one of the descendants of Hugh and Jemima Blackburn, Vera Philippa Blackburn (widow of William) who died in 1932, was keen on meteorology and had kept a rain gauge at Roshven in which she recorded the climate and rainfall for many years."]}, {"page": "Hugh Blackburn", "response": ["Bailie Hugh Blackburn (; 2 July 1823, Craigflower, Torryburn, Fife \u2013 9 October 1909, Roshven, Inverness-shire) was a Scottish mathematician.
