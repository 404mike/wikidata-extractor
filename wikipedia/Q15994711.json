When she was promoted to a higher salary grade, there were no positions in the civil service for a \"senior female cryptanalyst,\" and she was listed as a linguist instead. While Clarke developed a method of increasing the speed of double-encrypted messages, unlike many of the men, her decryption technique was not named after her. Other cryptographers at Bletchley included Margaret Rock, Mavis Lever (later Batey), Ruth Briggs and Kerry Howard. In 1941, Batey's work enabled the Allies to break the Italians' naval code before the Battle of Cape Matapan. In the United States, several faster Bombe machines were created. Women, like Louise Pearsall, were recruited from the WAVES to work on code breaking and operate the American Bombe machines."]}, {"page": "Portsmouth High School, Southsea", "response": ["* Margaret Rock (1903\u20131983), Bletchley Park codebreaker"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Bletchley Park", "response": ["* Margaret Rock, mathematician"]}, {"page": "Signals intelligence in modern history", "response": ["Breakthroughs were also made with Italian signals.

At the outbreak of the war Dilly Knox was the GC&CS's chief cryptanalyst  and, as such, took a leading role in the work on the various Enigma networks. His team, which he staffed with women (\"Dilly's girls\"), included Margaret Rock and Mavis Lever, sometimes termed \"Dilly's Fillies\". During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, Winston Churchill reportedly remarked to head of GC&CS Alastair Denniston: \"I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.\""]}]}}
