This was in part due to a split in the nationalist vote.\nIn August 1960 he was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for County Tyrone.In 1962 he stood to defend his seat, but this time he finished second to Tom Gormley, the independent runner-up in 1958, who by 1962 had successfully gained the Nationalist Party nomination.\nIn 1964 when the Chairman of the Nationalist Party, Joseph Stewart died, Blevins contested the by-election in Stewart's former East Tyrone constituency, again as an Ulster Unionist.
