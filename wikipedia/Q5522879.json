First Gareth Johnson drilled home a Down goal before P\u00e1draig Boyle flashed an angle shot to the net at the other end. Kerry took the lead in the 15th minute with a goal from Shane Nolan, who had moments earlier had a point awarded on a Hawk-Eye call. Kerry eased into a five-point lead, but only after a let-off which saw Johnson flash a first-time shot just wide. Down were awarded a penalty in the 29th minute after a run by Michael Ennis was illegally halted, but Paul Braniff drilled over the bar. Down continued to press in the closing stages of the half, cutting the deficit further with three more points."]}, {"page": "2005 Christy Ring Cup Final", "response": ["An opportunist goal from Gareth Johnson on 43 minutes, after Westmeath goalkeeper, Mark Briody, had saved from Martin Coulter, edged Down 1-12 to 0-14 in front.

However, in the space of three minutes, Down were only a point adrift, with their second goal coming from Stephen Clarke, who drilled the sliotar to the top right-hand corner of the net. On 70 minutes, Martin Coulter levelled from a free, only for Westmeath to crucially hit the last two points."]}, {"page": "Down county hurling team", "response": ["**2013 Paul Braniff, Gareth Johnson, Conor Woods & Patrick Hughes"]}]}}
