To that end, Emma is the central figure within the Encomium Emmae Reginae (incorrectly titled Gesta Cnutonis Regis during the later Middle Ages) a critical source for the study of English succession in the 11th century. During the reign of \u00c6thelred, Emma most likely served as little more than a figurehead a physical embodiment of the treaty between the English and her Norman father. However, her influence increased considerably under Cnut. Until 1043, writes Stafford, Emma \"was the richest woman in England ... and held extensive lands in the East Midlands and Wessex.\" Emma's authority was not simply tied to landholdings\u2014which fluctuated greatly from 1036 to 1043\u2014she also wielded significant sway over the ecclesiastical offices of England."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred I of Wessex", "response": ["Alfred records in the preamble to his will that \u00c6thelwulf had left property jointly to three of his sons, \u00c6thelbald, \u00c6thelred and Alfred, with the proviso that the brother who lived longest would succeed to all of it. When \u00c6thelbald died in 860, \u00c6thelred and Alfred, who were still young, agreed to entrust their share to the new king, \u00c6thelberht, on a promise that he would return it to them intact. When \u00c6thelred succeeded to the throne, Alfred asked him at a meeting of the witan (assembly of leading men) to give him his share of the property. However, \u00c6thelred said that he had attempted many times to divide it but had found it too difficult, and he would instead leave the whole to Alfred on his death. Some historians see the bequest as including the whole of \u00c6thelwulf's bookland, his personal property which he could leave in his will (as opposed to the folkland which passed according to customary law and property earmarked for the support of the crown); it is further argued that it was considered desirable that the bookland would be kept by the king, so \u00c6thelwulf's provision implies that the throne would pass to each brother in turn. However, other historians assert that the bequest had nothing to do with the kingship, and Alfred Smyth argues that the bequest was provision for \u00c6thelwulf's young sons when they reached adulthood, with \u00c6thelbald as trustee and residuary beneficiary if they died young. When Alfred succeeded, the supporters of \u00c6thelred's infant sons complained that Alfred should have shared the property with them, and Alfred had his father's will read to a meeting of the witan to prove his right to keep the whole of the property. Alfred rarely witnessed \u00c6thelred's charters, and this together with the argument over their father's will suggests that they may not have been on good terms. The historian Pauline Stafford suggests that \u00c6thelred may have chosen to highlight his wife's status as queen in a charter in order to assert his own sons' claims to the succession."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d", "response": ["Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d but they agree that \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw.

Alex Woolf concurs and Pauline Stafford describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\", referred to in charters in such terms as \"by the gift of Christ's mercy ruling the government of the Mercians\". Stafford argues that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d exercised most or all of the powers of a monarch after Alfred's death but it would have been a provocative act formally to claim regality, especially after \u00c6thelwold's rebellion.

Historians give varying explanations for both the rebellion and the marriage. In Nelson's view, \u00c6thelwulf's marriage to Judith added the West Saxon king to the family of kings and princely allies which Charles was creating. Charles was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and \u00c6thelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings; some historians such as Kirby and Pauline Stafford see the marriage as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. The marriage gave \u00c6thelwulf a share in Carolingian prestige, and Kirby describes the anointing of Judith as \"a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring.\" These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of \u00c6thelwulf's kingdom, and explain \u00c6thelbald's decision to rebel. The historian Michael Enright denies that an anti-Viking alliance between two such distant kingdoms could serve any useful purpose, and argues that the marriage was \u00c6thelwulf's response to news that his son was planning to rebel; his son by an anointed Carolingian queen would be in a strong position to succeed as king of Wessex instead of the rebellious \u00c6thelbald. Abels suggests that \u00c6thelwulf sought Judith's hand because he needed her father's money and support to overcome his son's rebellion, but Kirby and Smyth argue that it is extremely unlikely that Charles the Bald would have agreed to marry his daughter to a ruler who was known to be in serious political difficulty. \u00c6thelbald may also have acted out of resentment at the loss of patrimony he suffered as a result of the decimation."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["Historians give varying explanations for both the marriage and the rebellion. D. P. Kirby and Pauline Stafford see the match as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. Another factor was Judith's descent from Charlemagne: union with her gave \u00c6thelwulf a share in Carolingian prestige. Kirby describes her anointing as \"a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring.\" These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of \u00c6thelwulf's kingdom, and explain \u00c6thelbald's decision to rebel. He may also have feared that he would be disadvantaged if his father returned to rule Wessex while his brother kept Kent. Michael Enright argues that an alliance against the Vikings between such distant territories would have served no useful purpose. He sees the marriage as following \u00c6thelbald's rebellion and being a response to it, intending that a son of Judith would displace \u00c6thelbald as successor to the throne. Janet Nelson goes further, seeing \u00c6thelwulf's pilgrimage as intended from the start to enhance his prestige to assist him in facing down filial resentments. Kirby and Sean Miller argue that it is unlikely that Charles would have agreed to his daughter being taken to a country in a state of civil war, so \u00c6thelbald's revolt was probably a response to the marriage, which threatened to produce sons who had a stronger claim to the throne than he had. Richard Abels argues that \u00c6thelbald probably hoped that his rule would be permanent: \"All knew the dangers that attended a pilgrimage to Rome and were aware of the possibility that \u00c6thelwulf would not return. His departure to Rome all but invited the prowling of hungry \u00e6thelings.\" Charles may have agreed to the marriage because he was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and \u00c6thelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings. The marriage added the West Saxon king to the network of royal and princely allies that Charles was creating.", "Asser is the sole source for the dispute between \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald, which is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and according to Asser when \u00c6thelwulf returned to England he agreed to divide the kingdom to avoid a civil war. Most historians state that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht agreed to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to \u00c6thelwulf, although Simon Keynes thinks that \u00c6thelwulf kept a degree of sovereignty. Some historians argue that it is more likely that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping his power base west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf taking the east and \u00c6thelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby point out that Asser implies that Judith became queen of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller observes that Asser complained that the \"son ruled where by rightful judgment the father should have done; for the western part of the Saxon land has always been more important than the eastern\", and since Kent had been conquered only thirty years previously, it did not make sense to speak of it as having always been a less important part of the kingdom."]}, {"page": "Coenwulf of Mercia", "response": ["A charter of 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named Cynegyth; the charter is forged, but this detail is possibly accurate.Pauline Stafford, \"Political Womena\", in Brown & Farr, Mercia, p.\u00a042, n.\u00a05. \u00c6lfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf's wife, again from charter evidence; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817.\u00c6lfthryth 3, PASE.

Current historical research has shown that the ceremony was performed by Ealdred, owing to the controversy about Stigand's position.
