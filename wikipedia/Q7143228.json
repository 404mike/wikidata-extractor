She stated that the term was used when in a meeting the attendance was rapidly dropping off referring to the premise of the book, as one by one the individuals are killed, leaving only one person. It was stated by the Royal College of Nursing that one need only look at Bottrill's career and years of advocacy on behalf of nurses to see that it was an unfortunate slip of the tongue, referring back to the title of a book that was once in common use.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patricia Bottrill", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pat Bottrill"]}, {"page": "Bottrill", "response": ["* Pat Bottrill, English nurse"]}]}}
