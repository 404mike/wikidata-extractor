She was frequently billed as \"The Australian Jenny Lind\". She has the distinction of having been Australia's first Adalgisa in Bellini's opera Norma (1852, Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney) beside the Norma of Sara Flower. Her husband, having received a pardon from the Italian government, went to Italy in 1870, but died at Modena of gastric fever and inflammation of the lungs soon after his arrival. Madame Carandini continued to sing in concerts for some years in Australia and New Zealand, with visits to the United States and India. In November 1858 Carandini sang Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore in a twenty-seven performance season at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne. The Carandini troupe performed what may have been New Zealand's first full opera production when they performed Henry Bishop's Guy Mannering at Dunedin's Princess Theatre in September 1862."]}, {"page": "Lewis Henry Lavenu", "response": ["After falling into insolvency in 1848, Lavenu became the conductor of the Irish singer Catherine Hayes, making appearances in Great Britain, the United States (1851\u201352) and Australia (1855).

In July 1859 Lavenu (on cello) took part in a grand festival to inaugurate the new Great Hall of the University of Sydney with Carandini, Sara Flower, Emma Howson, Frank Howson and Walter Sherwin but died at the height of the festivities.

Her father, with his tenor brother, John, moved to Sydney in 1845 and remained based there until the mid-1860s when, at the suggestion of American actor Joseph Jefferson, the family travelled to America. Emma's early musical education and training therefore took place in Sydney, where one of her early mentors and teachers was the renowned English contralto Sara Flower.Orchard, W. Arundel.
