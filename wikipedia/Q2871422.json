The three islands (R\u00e9union, Mauritius and Rodrigues) were encountered some years earlier by chance during an exploratory expedition of the coast of the Bay of Bengal led by Trist\u00e3o da Cunha. The expedition ran into a cyclone and was forced to change course. Thus, the ship Cirne of the captain Diogo Fernandes Pereira, came into view of R\u00e9union island on 9 February 1507. They called the island \"Santa Apolonia\" (\"Saint Apollonia\") in honor of that day's saint. Mauritius was encountered during the same expedition and received the name of \"Cirne\" and Rodrigues that of \"Diogo Fernandes\".Jacques Auber, Histoire de l\u2019oc\u00e9an Indien, 1955, p. 233 Five years later, the islands were visited by Dom Pedro de MascarenhasAuguste Toussaint attributes the discovery of Mauritius to Mascarenhas whereas Albert Pitot hesitates to do so. Andr\u00e9 de Chapuiset Le Merle in his \"Pr\u00e9cis d\u2019histoire de l\u2019\u00eele Maurice\", 1948, states that it is really Pedro de Mascarenhas and not Pedro Mascarenhas, who went to India only in 1554. who left the name Mascarene for the whole region.

The expedition, consisting of eleven ships and 1,357 men under the orders of Admiral Corneille, came into the bay, which they named \"Rade des Tortues\" (literally meaning \"Harbor of the Tortoises\") because of the great number of terrestrial tortoises they found there.Auguste Toussaint, Histoire des \u00eeles Mascareignes, p. 24  From that date, Dutch sailors shifted their choice to Rade des Tortues as a harbor."]}, {"page": "Port Louis", "response": ["Port Louis was used as a harbour by the Dutch settlers from 1606, when they started to refer to the area as Harbour of Tortoises.Auguste Toussaint, Histoire des \u00eeles Mascareignes, p. 24 In 1736, under French government, it became the administrative centre of Mauritius and a major reprovisioning halt for French ships during their passage between Asia and Europe, around the Cape of Good Hope.Britannica,"]}, {"page": "Nicolas Baudin", "response": ["Baudin died of tuberculosis at Mauritius on 16 September 1803, at the age of 49, apparently in the home of Madame Alexandrine Kerivel.
