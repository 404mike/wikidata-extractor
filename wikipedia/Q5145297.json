He is not, however, without detractors. Cobb's works have been derided by some scholars as misanthropic, an application of Modern Age cynicism to eighteenth-century events. David A. Bell wrote of Cobb: \"Because his sympathetic insight did not extend from the monsters and opportunists to the true believers, he ended up, for all the richness of his work, presenting only one side of the Revolution. He even made it somewhat difficult to understand why a revolution happened in the first place.\""]}, {"page": "Laura Spence affair", "response": ["A political row broke out after Labour MP and then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown (who later became Prime Minister) commented on the decision at a Trades Union Congress reception. Brown accused the University of Oxford of elitism, saying that Spence's rejection was an \"absolute scandal\" and that he believed she had been discriminated against by \"an old establishment interview system\".  Spence's headteacher, Paul Kelley, also said he believed Oxford was \"missing out\" and that he thought that Spence had been rejected because of her being from the north east of England. The University of Oxford rebutted all allegations of discrimination. The BBC reported that Magdalen College had offered only five places to study medicine but had received twenty-two applicants, and that Oxford received a similar number of applications from state schools and private schools in the north east of England, and accepted a similar proportion from each. The admissions tutor at Magdalen, Andrew Hobson, also denied the claims, pointing out that he was from Newcastle.State school applicants to Oxford drop to 54pc, The Daily Telegraph, 28 October 2000. Colin Lucas, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, said that Brown's remarks were \"disappointing\", and an unnamed Conservative spokesman reportedly told the BBC: \"This is ignorant prejudice. Why doesn't Gordon Brown get on with delivering at least some of the things Labour were elected on, rather than telling universities which candidates they should pick for which courses, when he can't possibly know the full facts?\"Chancellor attacks Oxford admissions, BBC News, 26 May 2000."]}, {"page": "Colin Renshaw Lucas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Lucas"]}, {"page": "Boris Johnson", "response": ["In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen were married in West Felton, Shropshire, accompanied by a duet for violin and viola Allegra e Boris specially commissioned for the wedding from Hans Werner Henze.
