She starred as the test driver for the second and third series of The Grand Tour, an Amazon Prime Video-exclusive motoring series.\nEaton is a qualified racing instructor and a performance driving coach.

This caused a serious incident that involved six cars crashing into each other. Sarah Moore was the first driver to lose control of her car, spinning into the barrier at Raidillon. Abbie Eaton also lost the car and spun into the same barrier. She bounced back into Moore at low speed. Beitske Visser lost the rear end, spun around and went straight into Eaton and Moore, causing Eaton to go airbound. Ayla Agren did the same as Visser, spinning and running into Moore and an airbourne Eaton. Bel\u00e9n Garc\u00eda then hit all four cars, causing Visser to go airbourne and mount the tyre barrier. The final car of Fabienne Wohlwend then hit Beitske Visser head on, causing Visser to spin into the track and roll over. The incident ended with cars all over the track and run off areas. All drivers were checked as a precaution, and Visser and Agren were sent to hospital for x-rays and further checks. Eventually, all drivers were cleared and unharmed."]}, {"page": "Mike Skinner (racing driver)", "response": ["In 2016, Skinner starred as the test driver for the first series of the British motoring show The Grand Tour.

Reviews are conducted in varying locales abroad, or within the United Kingdom, including a specially designed racetrack, parallel to the Top Gear Test Track, called the \"Eboladrome\". The track is not only used for reviews, but also for conducting timed laps of vehicles that are reviewed, except for ten cars which were timed outside of filming before the launch of the first series. Timed laps are conducted by a professional driver assigned to the programme - while the first series involved former NASCAR driver Mike Skinner, who was contracted to operate under the name \"The American\" and portray a stereotypical redneck accent and viewpoints alongside scripted character traits, the poor reception to his involvement led to him being replaced by British racing driver Abbie Eaton for the second and third series.From episode 15 credits"]}, {"page": "2017 Blancpain GT Series", "response": ["|  Alex Demirdjian Abbie Eaton Davide Rizzo", "|align=left|  Abbie Eaton", "|align=left|  Alex Demirdjian Abbie Eaton Davide Rizzo"]}, {"page": "2017 Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup", "response": ["|  Abbie Eaton", "|  Alex Demirdjian Abbie Eaton Davide Rizzo", "|align=left|  Abbie Eaton", "|align=left|  Alex Demirdjian Abbie Eaton Davide Rizzo"]}, {"page": "2017 British GT Championship", "response": ["|  Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy", "response": ["|  Abbie Eaton", "|  Abbie Eaton", "| rowspan=\"3\" |  Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "AE Racing", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "Abigail Eaton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "Eaton Motorsport", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "2019 Super2 Series", "response": ["| Abbie Eaton", "* The Grand Tour test driver Abbie Eaton made her Super2 d\u00e9but with Matt Stone Racing.", "* Abbie Eaton withdrew from the championship following the Adelaide round due to sponsorship issues.", "|align=left|  Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "2019 TitansRX International Europe Series", "response": ["| Abbie Eaton", "| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | Abbie Eaton", "| align=\"left\" |  Abbie Eaton"]}, {"page": "The Grand Tour Game", "response": ["Most Scenes are similar to what happens in their respective episodes, although some Scenes have been altered or omitted due to licensing restrictions.
