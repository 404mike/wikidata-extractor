Help came from the growth of public wealth, increasing interest in art, and the increase in the commerce of art\u2014as exemplified by the career of such art dealers as Ernest Gambart\u2014and the growing demand for illustrated books. Hindrance to line engraving came from the desire for cheaper and more rapid methods \u2013 a desire satisfied in various ways, but especially, by etching and various kinds of photography."]}, {"page": "Goupil & Cie", "response": [": Established by Ernest Gambart. 17 Southampton Street.

This was from a sketch made on the spot in March 1855, four months after the battle. It shows the corpses of soldiers revealed by the melting snow, still lying where they fell the previous November but now surrounded by spring flowers.

Ford Madox Brown wrote in his diary: \"Hunt's Scapegoat requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.\" Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: \"I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat.\"  The Art Journal in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple, was to characterise the painting as \"having disappointed even his warmest admirers\"."]}, {"page": "Black Brunswickers", "response": ["The artwork took an estimated three months to paint, and it was greatly admired at the time.

Progress on the painting was delayed by difficulties with models, and eventually Hunt postponed it to work on another project, The Scapegoat. He eventually completed it in 1860, back in England. His friend Frederic George Stephens wrote a pamphlet containing a detailed explanation of the content and the characters. It was then shown in a series of popular travelling exhibitions at which visitors could buy the pamphlet and subscribe to an engraved reproduction. These were organised by the dealer Ernest Gambart, and proved a great financial success."]}, {"page": "Isabella and the Pot of Basil", "response": ["Hunt returned to the poem in 1866, shortly after his marriage, when he began to paint several erotically charged subjects. His sensuous painting Il Dolce Far Niente had sold quickly, and he conceived the idea for a new work depicting Isabella. Having travelled with his pregnant wife Fanny to Italy, Hunt began work on the painting in Florence. However, after giving birth, Fanny died from fever in December 1866. Hunt turned the painting into a memorial to his wife, using her features for Isabella. He worked on it steadily in the months after her death, returning to England in 1867, and finally completing it in January 1868. The painting was purchased and exhibited by the dealer Ernest Gambart."]}, {"page": "Pierre-Jules M\u00eane", "response": ["His work was first shown in London by Ernest Gambart in 1849. M\u00eane specialized in small bronze figures which explains why none of his works exist as public statuary. His work was a popular success with the bourgeois class and many editions of each sculpture were made, often to decorate private homes. The quality of these works is high, comparable to Barye's. M\u00eane enjoyed a longer period of success and celebrity than his contemporaries. He is considered to have been the lost-wax casting expert of his time. The lost-wax casting method is sometimes referred to as the cire perdue method."]}, {"page": "James Sant", "response": ["In 1861, his portraits of friends and relatives of Frances, Lady Waldegrave were exhibited by Ernest Gambart at his Gallery in Pall Mall.

Bonheur added finishing touches in 1855."]}, {"page": "Henriette Browne", "response": ["She next exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, where she immediately became a success. All five of her paintings were sold including Ecole de Pauvres a Aix purchased by Emperor Napoleon. The art dealer Ernest Gambart saw her work at the Exposition and promoted her at the French Gallery in London. From 1857 to 1859, Browne received more success. Empress Eugenie bought her work Les Puritaines for 6,000 francs from her five exhibited paintings in 1859. One of her other five contributions that year, Les Soeurs de Charit\u00e9, was particularly successful and won her a third class medal. Les Soeurs de Charit\u00e9 was a large painting portraying two nuns tending a sick child. The work caused a sensation only second to Rosa Bonheur's paintings and was purchased for 12,000 francs. Charles Kingsley described the painting as a perfect combination of realism and naturalism. Also in 1859, an exhibition of her work was held at the French Gallery in Pall Mall. The exhibition was well reviewed with the principal characteristic of her work being \u201crealistic simplicity\u201d. As opposed to Rosa Bonheur, Browne was viewed as a model of femininity and her paintings as expressions of womanly virtue."]}, {"page": "The Derby Day", "response": ["After the success of his earlier work, Life at the Seaside (also known as Ramsgate Sands), Frith was keen to find another contemporary piece. He visited Epsom in May 1856 with Augustus Egg and made an initial sketch. Frith was commissioned to paint a five- or six-foot canvas by the chemist Jacob Bell, for a fee of \u00a31,500. He also sold the right to sell copies of the painting, and one of his studies, to art dealer Ernest Gambart for another \u00a31,500. The work took nearly two years to complete, with different arrangements tried out on two large sketches and a further visit to the racecourse before the large work was completed."]}, {"page": "The Wounded Montenegrin", "response": ["The painting was first shown in public in 1882, at the Vienna Academy's annual student exhibition, which exhibited works produced during the 1881\u201382 academic year. It was well received by art critics and Jovanovi\u0107's peers, who judged it to be the exhibition's finest work and bestowed him the first-place prize. Jovanovi\u0107 also received an Austro-Hungarian government scholarship. The exact amount accorded to the artist is disputed. Petar Petrovi\u0107, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, writes that the scholarship amounted to 300 florins. Art historians Radmila Anti\u0107 and Nikola Kusovac state the scholarship amounted to 1,000 florins. Jovanovi\u0107's triumph at the student exhibition and the subsequent scholarship gave him the means to travel over the summer holidays, during which he came up with a number of ideas for future paintings, such as The Fencing Lesson (Ma\u010devanje). Winning the Vienna Academy prize established him as a respected painter of Orientalist works and set the stage for further recognition and success. In 1883, Jovanovi\u0107 entered into a contract with Ernest Gambart's French Gallery in London to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life. This contract assured him lifelong financial security."]}]}}
