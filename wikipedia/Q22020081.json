He landscaped it with winding walks, trees and shrubs, fenced around with an iron railing. Flower shows were organised, held in tents. The centre spot was used to commemorate Sir Walter Scott with the first ever monument dedicated to him. The 80 foot fluted Doric column of Giffnock \"liver rock\" sandstone was designed by the competition winning architect David Rhind, who appointed John Greenshields to design the statue above, which was executed by John Ritchie. The monument was completed by 1837, some years before Scott was commemorated in Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "Lesmahagow", "response": ["*John Greenshields (1795\u20131835) a short-lived but talented Scottish sculptor responsible for works such as Sir Walter Scott in Parliament House, Edinburgh"]}, {"page": "Glenfinnan", "response": ["By 1815, the Jacobite cause was no longer a political threat to the Hanoverian monarchy.

The Duke wanted to erect a grand residence which not only reflected the increasing wealth and national standing of the family but also provided an appropriately grand setting for the considerable art collections which he continued to gather, including the Beckford art collection and library that his wife Susan had inherited from her father William Thomas Beckford. This refurbishment included heraldic carvings in the main pediment over the entrance, carved by John Greenshields in 1822. Between 1822 and 1828 the north front itself was enhanced and enlarged by the distinguished Glasgow architect David Hamilton. The 15-bayed, three storey north front was  long and  high, adorned with a colossal portico of six  Corinthian columns. In addition to existing rooms such as the Long Gallery, Old Dining Room, Old State Breakfast Room, Old State Drawing Room and Old State Bedroom, new state rooms such as the Egyptian Hall, Entrance Hall, Tribune, Billiard Room, Charter Room, State Dining Room, Drawing Room, State Bedroom, Music Room, the Hamilton Library and the Beckford Library were built. These held much fine furniture and by the mid-19th century housed one of the best private collections of paintings in Scotland, including works by Peter Paul Rubens (see below), Titian, Anthony van Dyck, and other masters.
