The film was shot on location at Eastnor Castle and Hellens Manor in Herefordshire and the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway. The story is updated to the 1940s (and later 1953) when, following the death of Stephen's parents, the young boy has been evacuated to the countryside during World War II. This production is unusual in that the film was shot in two parts, with the main elements being filmed in 2005 and the beginning and end of the film in 2016, with Louis Newton returning as Stephen, now a young man recounting to his bride-to-be the story of what happened ten years earlier.

Montague took in lodgers, one of whom, the novelist Colin MacInnes, agreed to show a manuscript of Haltrecht's to his own publisher Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, who had previously rejected it. To his amazement, this time the publisher accepted it for publication. Jonah and His Mother, a novel about a young man finding his sexual identity, was Montague Haltrecht's first published book and appeared in 1964 with mixed, but generally good, reviews, The Sunday Times newspaper critic calling it \"Witty, assured first novel\" and The Guardian describing it variously as \"Cool elegance, ingenious style\" and a \"small barbed masterpiece\". Film rights were even discussed with a Hollywood studio, but were subsequently not taken up. The following year, 1965, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch published his second novel A Secondary Character, for which two works combined he won the Henfield Foundation Award. Four years later Collins published his third novel, The Devil Is a Single Man in 1969, followed a year later by The Edgware Road in 1970. His fifth and final book, also published by Collins, in 1975, was The Quiet Showman, a biography of Sir David Webster and the history of opera at the Royal Opera House from World War II to the 1970s. Haltrecht also ventured into writing for the stage when in 1974 he wrote a one-woman play for Judi Dench called Ellen Terry \u2013 The Harum Scarum Girl based on the life of the English stage actress. This was later produced for the theatre with the South African actress Bess Finney in the title role and directed by Nicholas Amer at both the Buxton and Edinburgh festivals and on a tour to South Africa.", "Despite the critics' praise, and a literary award, Haltrecht's novels had not made him any money. Following the publication of his first novel, he had found a partner in 1965, the actor Nicholas Amer, to share his life with. Amer advised him to take some photos that he had to the Ugly Models agency where he was accepted and became much in demand. The jobs on offer were so lucrative that they gave him the time he needed for writing. However, a demanding schedule of travel to Germany, Italy and South Africa soon followed.", "Haltrecht, being born into an Orthodox Jewish community, struggled with his homosexuality. As a young man, he was sent for weekly visits, paid for by his father, to a Jewish psychiatrist. After three attempts at proving him to be heterosexual, or at least bisexual, had ended in failure, he refused any more visits. The publication of his first novel was enough to enable him to find his voice, and within a year he had met and fallen in love with the man who was to share the rest of his life, the actor Nicholas Amer. They lived together in Bloomsbury for the next 45 years, becoming civil partners in 2009 following the change in the law governing same-sex couples as a result of the passing of the Civil Partnership Act 2004.
