He was capped for Wales national rugby union team on two occasions.\nDavies played for a wide variety of club teams, but it was while he was with Aberavon that he was selected to play for Wales against the touring, 1947 Australian team. It was a dull encounter played out between the forwards, but Davies finished on the winning side as Wales won 6-0. Davies gained his second and final cap in the 1948 Five Nations Championship in the last game of the tournament against Ireland. It was a close game, but Ireland won 6-3, and won the Triple Crown for the first time since 1899. He died on 6 September 2016 at the age of 94.", "link_mentions": {}}}
