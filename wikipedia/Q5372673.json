He was capped for Wales national rugby union team on two occasions.\nDavies played for a wide variety of club teams, but it was while he was with Aberavon that he was selected to play for Wales against the touring, 1947 Australian team. It was a dull encounter played out between the forwards, but Davies finished on the winning side as Wales won 6\u20130. Davies gained his second and final cap in the 1948 Five Nations Championship in the last game of the tournament against Ireland. It was a close game, but Ireland won 6\u20133, and won the Triple Crown for the first time since 1899. He died on 6 September 2016 at the age of 94.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberavon RFC", "response": ["*  Emlyn Davies (2 caps)"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*15 January \u2013 Emlyn Davies, rugby international (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America", "response": ["WALES: Billy Cleaver, Ken Jones, Bleddyn Williams, Jack Matthews, Leslie Williams, Glyn Davies, Handel Greville, Emlyn Davies, Mal James, Cliff Davies, John Gwilliam, Bill Tamplin, Ossie Williams, Les Manfield, Gwyn Evans "]}, {"page": "Glyncorrwg RFC", "response": ["*  Emlyn Davies (2 caps)"]}, {"page": "Cwmavon RFC", "response": ["* Emlyn Davies (2 caps)"]}, {"page": "Les Anthony", "response": ["Les Anthony was born in Rhiwfawr, Wales. he was worked as a collier and sheet metal worker, and he died aged 88.
