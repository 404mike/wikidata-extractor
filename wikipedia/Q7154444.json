He grew up in East Pennard, Somerset, and is noted for being reserved in interviews.In between Kula Shaker splitting in 1999 and reforming in 2006, Winterhart played drums for Thirteen:13, did sessions work with Aqualung and formed blues-rock band \"Zero Point Field\", who prior to Kula Shaker reforming were working on their debut album. After Kula Shaker released Pilgrim's Progress, Winterhart also played in the Somerset psychedelic rock band, Goldray, with Reef guitarist Kenwyn House, and the London-based alternative rock band Black Casino & The Ghost.Winterhart lives in Lower Clapton, Hackney, London, with his wife, Nicole, his children, Ivy and Faye, and his Newfoundland dog, Willow. Willow is so large that she was once mistakenly believed to be the \"Beast of Hackney Marshes\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kula Shaker", "response": ["The origin of Kula Shaker can be traced back to 1988 when Crispian Mills (grandson of Sir John Mills and son of actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting) met Alonza Bevan at Richmond upon Thames College in South-West London. The two went on to play together in a band named Objects of Desire, formed later that year. The band's initial line-up consisted of Mills on lead guitar, Bevan on bass, Richard Cave on drums (until 1990) later Marcus French (aka Frog) on drums, Leigh Morris on rhythm guitar, and Marcus Maclaine (then Hayley Mills' boyfriend) on lead vocals. In 1991, Paul Winterhart joined the band, replacing French on drums. During this period, Crispian and Alonza were also responsible for running the Mantra Shack, a psychedelic nightclub at the back of Richmond ice rink, and consequently, the Objects of Desire would often perform at the venue.", "Kula Shaker's reformation has its origins in sessions for a charity album made with the New Braj Village School (a private school in Badger, California, for young people which includes as part of the curriculum teachings about Krishna and devotional music). The album School of Braja was recorded in 2004 and finally saw release in late 2006. Mills, who masterminded the album, arranged not only that the Jeevas play on two tracks, but he also got in touch with his old bandmate, Alonza Bevan. The two worked on a song together for the album, \"Braj Mandala\", to which Paul Winterhart added drums. Jay Darlington was asked to be part of the sessions, but declined the opportunity. At the time of the recording, this was announced on the official Jeevas website as Kula Shaker having reformed to contribute a song to the album and was referred to by Mills as a Kula Shaker reunion in subsequent interviews. Additionally, the School of Braja album credits officially state that Kula Shaker appear on the track \"Braj Mandala\". The sessions for the track went so well that Mills and Bevan began writing together again and making plans for a full-on Kula Shaker comeback that would encompass live touring and the further release of new material. A new band website was also commissioned.", "*Paul Winterhart \u2013 drums, percussion (1995\u20131999, 2004\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "K (album)", "response": ["*Paul Winterhart \u2013 Drums"]}, {"page": "Aynsley Lister", "response": ["* Paul Winterhart (Drums)"]}, {"page": "Pilgrims Progress (album)", "response": ["* Paul Winterhart \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Naked Remedy", "response": ["Past individual achievements of band members include sharing the bill with Velvet Revolver, Status Quo, Jeff Healey, Walter Trout, Chicken Shack, Wishbone Ash, Hayseed Dixie and Rose Hill Drive, and bookings at The Royal Albert Hall and Download Festival 2008.
