Gibson has challenged the veracity of Sale and Darwish, citing declassified documents that indicate the CIA was blindsided by the timing of the assassination attempt on Qasim and that the NSC \"had just reaffirmed [its] nonintervention policy\" on October 1. Dulles predicted six days prior to the incident that an attempt on Qasim's life might be made \"in the next two months,\" which Gibson suggests is indicative of \"a lack of concrete intelligence\". Considering that U.S. officials publicly expressed hope that Qasim would quickly recover from his injuries and privately sought to dissuade Jordan and Iran from militarily intervening in Iraq during Qasim's hospitalization, Gibson surmised that \"while the United States was aware of several plots against Qasim, it had still adhered to its nonintervention policy.\" In a similar vein, Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt observes: \"I am unaware of any evidence of covert relations between the CIA and the Ba'ath prior to the October 7 [assassination attempt].\u00a0... It seems more likely that it was October 7 that brought the Ba'ath to the attention of the US government.\" However, Kenneth Osgood\u2014while acknowledging that there is \"little direct documentary proof\" of American participation in the plot\u2014comments that because it is widely accepted that Egypt \"was involved on some level\" and that \"The United States was working with Nasser on some level\u00a0... the circumstantial evidence is such that the possibility of US\u2013UAR collaboration with Ba'ath Party activists cannot be ruled out.\" Moreover, the CIA was engaged in contingency planning against Qasim's government during the time period in question: \"Whatever the validity of [Sale's] charges, at the very least currently declassified documents reveal that US officials were actively considering various plots against Qasim and that the CIA was building up assets for covert operations in Iraq.\""]}, {"page": "Just Journalism", "response": ["In 2008, Just Journalism's Director Adel Darwish and board member Nick Cohen resigned from their positions, citing disagreements with the organisation's chair and founder, on the issue of neutrality.\"Neutrality was very much at the heart of the dispute between myself and the chairwoman of the board (the lady who founded the organisation) as I insisted on neutrality from the start.
