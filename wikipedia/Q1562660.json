A native of Glasgow (he was actually born outside the Glasgow boundary, in Thornliebank, Renfrewshire), he was the first ballplayer born in Scotland to appear in a major league game.\nMcCormick was great friends with Mike \"King\" Kelly and was also very well liked by Cap Anson, two of the great personalities of early baseball.
