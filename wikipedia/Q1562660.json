A native of Glasgow (he was actually born outside the Glasgow boundary, in Thornliebank, Renfrewshire), he was the first ballplayer born in Scotland to appear in a major league game.\nMcCormick was great friends with Mike \"King\" Kelly and was also very well liked by Cap Anson, two of the great personalities of early baseball. Anson was McCormick's captain-manager in 1885 and 1886, when Chicago won its last 19th-century pennants.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cleveland Indians", "response": ["In 1876, the National League (NL) supplanted the NA as the major professional league. Cleveland was not among its charter members, but by 1879 the league was looking for new entries and the city gained an NL team.  The Cleveland Forest Citys were recreated, but rebranded in 1882 as the Cleveland Blues, because the National League required distinct colors for that season.  The Blues had mediocre records for six seasons and were ruined by a trade war with the Union Association (UA) in 1884, when its three best players (Fred Dunlap, Jack Glasscock, and Jim McCormick) jumped to the UA after being offered higher salaries.  The Cleveland Blues merged with the St. Louis Maroons UA team in 1885."]}, {"page": "November 3", "response": ["*1856 \u2013 Jim McCormick, Scottish-American baseball player and manager (d. 1918)"]}, {"page": "1918", "response": ["**Jim McCormick, Scottish-born American baseball player (b. 1856)"]}, {"page": "Complete game", "response": ["# Jim McCormick\u00a0\u2013 466", "# (tie) Jim McCormick\u00a0\u2013 72 (1880)", "# (tie) Jim McCormick\u00a0\u201365 (1882)"]}, {"page": "Major League Baseball titles streaks", "response": [":Jim McCormick, 3 (1880\u20131882)"]}, {"page": "Veterans Committee", "response": ["Negro league players: Newt Allen (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), John Beckwith (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), William Bell (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), Chet Brewer (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), Bill Byrd (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), Rap Dixon (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), John Donaldson (on 2006 Negro League Ballot), Sammy T.
