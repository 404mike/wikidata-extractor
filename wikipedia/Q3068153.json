Partly to redeem his reputation, Ross proposed to use a shallow-draft steamship to break through the ice. The Admiralty was not interested, but he was able to convince the gin-magnate Felix Booth to finance this second Arctic expedition, which began in 1829. His ship was the Victory, a side-wheel steamer with paddles that could be lifted away from the ice and an experimental high-pressure boiler built by John Ericsson. The Victory had been built in 1826 and previously had served as a ferry between Liverpool and the Isle of Man. The engine caused trouble and during the first winter, it was dumped on the shore. The ship carried four officers \u2013 John Ross, James Clark Ross, William Thom, surgeon George McDiarmid \u2013 and 19\u00a0men.

In 1826 it was purchased by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney for the construction of his famed 'steam carriages', one of which made the journey from London to Bath and back, in July 1829.

In 1840 Grimble decided to embark on producing vinegar from spirit left over from the distilling process.  He went into partnership with Sir Felix Booth, and they set up premises in the North East corner of the Market.  The venture was unsuccessful so they turned to the more conventional method of vinegar brewing.
