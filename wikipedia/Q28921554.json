Donald's study included an examination of available medical respirators and he was not satisfied with the design and efficiency of operation of the current models. Donald had an interest in mechanical and technological devices from childhood, so he decided to build a new respirator. By 1952 Donald and Young had built a new medical negative-pressure respirator that they demonstrated at the meeting of the Physiological Society in a room at the Royal Free Hospital."]}, {"page": "Neonatal Society", "response": ["Previous presidents include David Hull, Robert McCance, Peter Tizard, Elsie Widdowson, Maureen Young, Andrew Wilkinson and, the current president-elect of the British Medical Association, Neena Modi."]}, {"page": "Osmund Reynolds", "response": ["Edmunds was the son of Edward Reynolds, a solicitor, and his wife, Edna (n\u00e9e Jones).
