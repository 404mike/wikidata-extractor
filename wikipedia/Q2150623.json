He claimed at the time that the format echoed the tall window of his campus studio, and was confirmed for him by Chinese scroll paintings he saw in the university's gallery. Jacobson had asked him to contribute an image to a portfolio of new prints to be published in 1976 in celebration of the bicentenary of John Constable's birth; the other artists contributing included David Hockney, Robyn Denny and Richard Smith. Tillyer used this unfamiliar, anti-landscape format for an etching done in honour of Constable, For John Constable: The Cape, New England; it enabled him to keep his distance from the artist he was paying respect to. He used a large proportion of aquatint, apparently brushed on like watercolour. Evening light catches on clouds that fill the vertical slice of sky; at the bottom can be seen the sails of the Hampstead windmill that appears in certain Constable pictures. Its presence determines the scale of the whole, and presents a contrast between that one man-made detail, at the foot of the tall print, and the soft, delicate, but somewhat threatening swathes of lilac that almost fill the rest."]}, {"page": "John Kasmin", "response": ["Other artists that Kasmin showed included Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, Helen Frankenthaler, Anthony Caro, William G.

The shaped canvas was born from the desire to break away from the traditional square or rectangular frame of painting. Rather than a formalized medium or window that contained the subject, the contours of the painting became part of the subject itself. In the mid-1960s several abstract minimalist painters were experimenting with its possibilities, the most famous of which is Frank Stella. Charles Hinman drove the concept further by pushing the canvas out from the wall; his works were a form of hybrid between painting and sculpture. This type of painting is known as a three-dimensional shaped canvas. As early as 1963-64 Charles Hinman created sculptural paintings with protruding geometric and undulating forms. While Sven Lukin and Richard Smith were also experimenting with the use of the three-dimensional canvas around the same time, Charles Hinman's defining particularity was his focus on the illusion of space and subtly suggested volume, embracing the use of color, shadow and reflection. He was influenced by Ellsworth Kelly in his flat and contrasting Hard-edge use of color but with the objective of generating and accentuating a perception of volume. In the subsequent years until the early 1970s, Hinman examined the possibilities offered by this new medium: strongly protruding canvases, geometric and sensual profiles, color contrasts, color reflections on the adjacent wall, shadows, monochrome canvases."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Richard Smith (artist)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Richard Smith, 84, painter."]}, {"page": "2016 in art", "response": ["*April 16 - Richard Smith, 84, British painter"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2016", "response": ["*Richard Smith, 84, British painter, heart failure.Richard Smith, British Painter Who Turned Toward Pure Color, Dies at 84"]}, {"page": "4. documenta", "response": ["|David Smith || Richard Smith || Tony Smith || Robert Stanley || Frank Stella ||"]}, {"page": "Jan Cicero Gallery", "response": ["Her early efforts received mixed results; New Art Examiner critics Jane Allen and Derek Guthrie panned an early group show that she curated for the aesthetics of its public setting in a Northwestern University building lobby and for its inclusiveness, despite also noting the presence of \"some of Chicago's finer abstract artists.\" Nonetheless, the gallery's abstract artists were soon receiving consistent recognition from the magazine, as well as from newspaper critics like SchulzeHayden, Harold, \"Drawings, realistic and far-out\", Chicago Sun Times, Show, June 13, 1977, p.5.Artner, Alan. \"A Vial Refilled with Intelligence,\" Chicago Tribune, August 31, 1979. and the Art Institute of Chicago.Art Institute of Chicago.
