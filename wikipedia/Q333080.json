After being an active Liberal as a young man in the 1920s, the following decade he practised as a barrister and served on Hoylake Urban District Council, by which time he had become a Conservative Party sympathiser. During the Second World War he rose to be Deputy Chief of Staff of Second Army, playing an important role in planning sea transport to the Normandy beachhead and reaching the acting rank of brigadier.\nElected to Parliament in 1945, he held ministerial office from 1951, eventually rising to be Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Anthony Eden from April 1955. His tenure coincided with the Suez Crisis, for which he at first attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement, before reluctantly assisting with Eden's wish to negotiate collusion with France and Israel as a prelude to military action. He continued as Foreign Secretary under the premiership of Harold Macmillan until July 1960, when he was moved to the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this job he set up the NEDC, but became an increasingly unpopular figure because of the contractionary measures which he felt compelled to take, including the \"Pay Pause\" of July 1961, culminating in the sensational Liberal victory at the Orpington by-election in March 1962. In July 1962 Macmillan sacked him from the Cabinet, making him the highest-profile casualty in the reshuffle known as the \"Night of the Long Knives\".\nHe returned to office under Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home as Leader of the House of Commons (1963\u201364), and was elected Speaker of the House of Commons from 1971 until his retirement in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bloody Sunday (1972)", "response": ["Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another wounded man dying subsequently, which his family believed was from injuries suffered that day.

No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or bombs, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims. The British Army's version of events, outlined by the Ministry of Defence and repeated by Home Secretary Reginald Maudling in the House of Commons the day after Bloody Sunday, was that paratroopers returned fire at gunmen and bomb-throwers. Bernadette Devlin, the independent Irish socialist republican Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Ulster, slapped Maudling for his comments, and was temporarily suspended from Parliament. Having seen the shootings firsthand, she was infuriated that the Speaker of the House of Commons, Selwyn Lloyd, repeatedly denied her the chance to speak about it in Parliament, although convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be allowed to do so."]}, {"page": "Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty", "response": ["On 31 March 1958, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved a decision to halt nuclear testing, conditional on other nuclear powers doing the same. Khrushchev then called on Eisenhower and Macmillan to join the moratorium. Despite the action being met with widespread praise and an argument from Dulles that the US should reciprocate, Eisenhower dismissed the plan as a \"gimmick\"; the Soviet Union had just completed a testing series and the US was about to begin Operation Hardtack I, a series of atmospheric, surface-level, and underwater nuclear tests. Eisenhower instead insisted that any moratorium be linked to reduced production of nuclear weapons. In April 1958, the US began Operation Hardtack I as planned. The Soviet declaration concerned the British government, which feared that the moratorium might lead to a test ban before its own testing program was completed. Following the Soviet declaration, Eisenhower called for an international meeting of experts to determine proper control and verification measures\u2014an idea first proposed by British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd."]}, {"page": "1978", "response": ["** Selwyn Lloyd, English politician (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "Shimon Peres", "response": ["At S\u00e8vres, Peres took part in planning alongside Maurice Bourg\u00e8s-Maunoury, Christian Pineau and Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces General Maurice Challe, and British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd and his assistant Sir Patrick Dean. Britain and France enlisted Israeli support for an alliance against Egypt. The parties agreed that Israel would invade the Sinai. Britain and France would then intervene, purportedly to separate the warring Israeli and Egyptian forces, instructing both to withdraw to a distance of 16 kilometres from either side of the canal.The Protocol of Sevres 1956 Anatomy of a War Plot.

The British and French would then argue, according to the plan, that Egypt's control of such an important route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. The agreement at S\u00e8vres was initially described by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden as the \"highest form of statesmanship\". The three allies, especially Israel, were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives. However, the extremely hostile reaction to the Suez Crisis from both the United States and the USSR forced them to withdraw, resulting in a failure of Britain and France's political and strategic aims of controlling the Suez Canal."]}, {"page": "Puyi", "response": ["In late 1956, Puyi acted in a play, The Defeat of the Aggressors, about the Suez Crisis, playing the role of a left-wing Labor MP who challenges in the House of Commons a former Manchukuo minister playing the Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.Behr, 1987 p 310.

Macmillan had a number of meetings with US Ambassador Winthrop Aldrich, in which he said that if he were Prime Minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan (\"A straight, fine man, and so far as he is concerned, the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war\").Howard 1987, p. 242Thorpe 2010, pp. 352\u201353 Eisenhower said these words in a meeting with Treasury Secretary Humphrey (who was pro-Butler), Under Secretary of State Hoover and Staff Secretary Andrew Goodpaster. It is unclear whether there was direct pressure from the US Administration for Macmillan to be chosen, or rather whether being the candidate best placed to rebuild bridges with the Americans was simply another reason why leading Conservatives preferred him to Butler. Published accounts do not agree about the date of the meeting. Williams (2008, p. 270) lists it as happening on 20 November, a date repeated in Michael Jago's 2015 biography of Rab Butler. Macmillan's other recent biographer D. R. Thorpe gives it as 24 December, presumably an error as the footnote refers to Eisenhower's papers for November 1956, while in his biography of Anthony Eden (2003, p. 539) Thorpe gives it as 24 November.", "Macmillan filled government posts with 35 Old Etonians, seven of them in Cabinet.David Butler, Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000, Macmillan, 8th edition, 2000.

Brief encounters: meetings with remarkable people (2001) p. 214 Macmillan's Defence Minister, Duncan Sandys, wrote at the time: \"Eden had no gift for leadership; under Macmillan as PM everything is better, Cabinet meetings are quite transformed\".Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.169 Many ministers found Macmillan to be more decisive and brisk than either Churchill or Eden had been. Another of Macmillan's ministers, Charles Hill, stated that Macmillan dominated Cabinet meetings \"by sheer superiority of mind and of judgement\".Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.170 Macmillan frequently made allusions to  history, literature and the classics at cabinet meetings, giving him a reputation as being both learned and entertaining, though many ministers found his manner too authoritarian. Macmillan had no \"inner cabinet\", and instead maintained one-on-one relationships with a few senior ministers such as Rab Butler who usually served as acting prime minister when Macmillan was on one of his frequent visits abroad. Selwyn Lloyd described Macmillan as treating most of his ministers like \"junior officers in a unit he commanded\". Lloyd recalled that Macmillan: \"regarded the Cabinet as an instrument to play upon, a body to be molded to his will...very rarely did he fail to get his way\" Macmillan generally allowed his ministers much leeway in managing their portfolios, and only intervened if he felt something had gone wrong. Macmillan was especially close to his three private secretaries, Tom Bligh, Freddie Bishop and Philip de Zulueta, who were his favourite advisers. Many cabinet ministers often complained that Macmillan took the advice of his private secretaries more seriously than he did their own.", "Britain's balance of payments problems led Chancellor Selwyn Lloyd to impose a seven-month wage freeze in 1961 and, amongst other factors, this caused the government to lose popularity and a series of by-elections in March 1962, of which the most famous was Orpington on 14 March.Thorpe 2010, p. 518 Butler leaked to the Daily Mail on 11 July 1962 that a major reshuffle was imminent.Thorpe 2010, p. 520 Macmillan feared for his own position and later (1 August) claimed to Lloyd that Butler, who sat for a rural East Anglian seat likely to suffer from EEC agricultural protectionism, had been planning to split the party over EEC entry (there is no evidence that this was so).Thorpe 2010, p. 524", "In the 1962 cabinet reshuffle known as the 'Night of the Long Knives', Macmillan sacked eight Ministers, including Selwyn Lloyd. The Cabinet changes were widely seen as a sign of panic, and the young Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe said of Macmillan's dismissals 'greater love hath no man than this, than to lay down his friends for his life'. Macmillan was openly criticised by his predecessor Lord Avon, an almost unprecedented act.Thorpe 2010, p. 525", "Campbell writes that: \"a late developer who languished on the back benches ... in the 1930s, Macmillan seized his opportunity when it came with flair and ruthlessness, and [until about 1962] filled the highest office with compelling style\". However, he argues that Macmillan is remembered as having been \"a rather seedy conjuror\", famous for Premium Bonds, Beeching's cuts to the railways and the Profumo Scandal. He is also remembered for \"stop-go\" economics: first expansion despite the opposition of Thorneycroft and his team, then Selwyn Lloyd's Pay Pause, and then finally the Maudling boom, with Britain's relative economic decline, especially compared to the EEC, becoming clear despite perceptions of consumer \"affluence\" in the late 1950s. In the 1980s the aged Macmillan was seen as \"a revered but slightly pathetic figure\".Campbell 2009, p. 292", "* Selwyn Lloyd: Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "* Selwyn Lloyd: Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "* Selwyn Lloyd: Chancellor of the Exchequer", "* Selwyn Lloyd: Chancellor of the Exchequer"]}, {"page": "George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy", "response": ["In 1974 Thomas was elected Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.

In July 1983 he retired and was raised to the peerage with a hereditary peerage as Viscount Tonypandy, of Rhondda in the County of Mid Glamorgan.
