Hulme had written, in the years immediately preceding his death in World War I in 1917, a series of essays in which he attacked the subjectivism and vagueness of romantic literature and advocated \"dry and hard\" images in poetry as well as objectivity and discipline in art in general. Hulme believed that \"man is by nature bad or limited, and can consequently only accomplish anything of value by disciplines, ethical, heroic or political\", and he saw one consequence of this belief as an abandonment of romantic optimism about the nature and potentialities of man. Hulme's views influenced T. S. Eliot and are reflected in Eliot's influential essay, Tradition and the Individual Talent, which first appeared in 1917.\" \u2014 Daiches, David (1962). \"The New Criticism.\" In: Time of Harvest, American Literature, 1910\u20131960.

For instance, I have no desire to become an American citizen. Recently, when I arrived at Boston, the immigration officer commented on the length of time I've held a Green Card. 'A Green Card is usually considered a path to citizenship,' he said, a sentiment both irritatingly reproving and movingly patriotic. I mumbled something about how he was perfectly correct, and left it at that. [...] The poet and novelist Patrick McGuinness, in his forthcoming book Other People's Countries (itself a rich analysis of home and homelessness; McGuinness is half-Irish and half-Belgian) quotes Simenon, who was asked why he didn't change his nationality, 'the way successful francophone Belgians often did'. Simenon replied: 'There was no reason for me to be born Belgian, so there\u2019s no reason for me to stop being Belgian.' I wanted to say something similar, less wittily, to the immigration officer: precisely because I don't need to become an American citizen, to take citizenship would seem flippant; leave its benefits for those who need a new land.\""]}, {"page": "Poetry Review", "response": ["Muriel Spark led the Review dynamically from 1947 to 1949, introducing a fee to be paid to contributors, but she was ousted for her poetic radicalism and liberal views.
