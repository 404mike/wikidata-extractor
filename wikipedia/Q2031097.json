He served in the First World War as a cruiser commander and after the war became a battle squadron commander and later Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. Becoming First Sea Lord in November 1938, his major contribution in that role was to abandon the official British policy of sending a major fleet to Singapore to deter Japanese aggression (the Singapore strategy), realising the immediate threat was closer to home (from Germany and Italy) and that such a policy was no longer viable. He died from a brain tumour in July 1939 just before the outbreak of the Second World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort", "response": ["On 21 December Gort recommended to the Chiefs of Staff that Britain would need to help France defend Holland and Belgium and that for that purpose the British Army needed complete equipment for four Regular army infantry divisions and two mobile armoured divisions, with the Territorial army armed with training equipment and then war equipment for four divisions. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, replied that Britain's continental commitment might not be a limited liability. Gort replied: \"Lord Kitchener had clearly pointed out that no great country can wage a 'little' war\". He also attacked as a fallacy the theory of strategic mobility by the use of seapower because in modern war land transport was faster and cheaper than transport by sea. The experience of David Lloyd George's 1917 Alexandretta project \"proved that [maritime side-shows] invariably led to vast commitments out of all proportion to the value of the object attained\". If a purely defensive position was taken the Maginot Line would be broken, and the British Army (with anti-aircraft defence) was only getting \u00a3277\u00a0million out of a total \u00a32,000\u00a0million spent on defence."]}, {"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["|  || 100px || Backhouse RogerSir Roger Backhouse || 1878 || 1939 || First Sea Lord 1938\u20131939 ||Heathcote, p. 21.

She again became the temporary fleet flagship when Nelson began a lengthy refit the following month and Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse hoisted his flag aboard her. Rodney visited Oslo, Norway, in July. Nelsons refit ended in February 1938 and the sisters made a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal that same month. Captain Edward Syfret relieved Whitworth on 16 August, shortly before Rodney began her annual short refit in September. After the completion of her post-refit trials in January 1939, Rear-Admiral Lancelot Holland hoisted his flag aboard the ship as the commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron. She fired a 21-gun salute in honor of the French President Albert Lebrun's arrival in Dover in March for talks with the British government. As the Home Fleet was assembling in Scapa Flow as tensions with Germany rose in August, Rodney developed steering problems and had to proceed to Rosyth for repairs and a bottom cleaning.Ballantyne 2008, pp. 82\u201383, 86\u201389; Burt, pp. 381\u2013382"]}, {"page": "Home Fleet", "response": ["|3 ||Admiral || 25px || Sir Roger Backhouse ||August 1935 \u2013 April 1938"]}, {"page": "Supermarine Walrus", "response": ["The strength of the aircraft was demonstrated in 1935, when the prototype was attached to the battleship Nelson at Portland.Nicholl 1966, p. 26.

Soon afterwards, the Walrus became one of the first aircraft to be fitted with an undercarriage position indicator on the instrument panel.Mitchell 2006, p. 136. Test pilot Alex Henshaw later stated that the Walrus was strong enough to make a wheels-up landing on grass without much damage, but also commented that it was \"the noisiest, coldest and most uncomfortable\" aircraft he had ever flown."]}, {"page": "Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope", "response": ["He retained command until September 1938, when he was appointed to the Admiralty as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, although he did not actually take up this post until December 1938.

For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Admiralty Board.
