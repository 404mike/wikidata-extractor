His early plays such as Blow-Job (1971) were overtly political, often combining harsh social comment with comedy.  In his later works he moved away from purely political themes, embracing a range of surrealist, magical, philosophical and madcap, darkly comic subjects.\nAfter studying literature at the University of East Anglia, Wilson began his writing career in 1969.  He began to build his reputation with a series of plays and screenplays in the early 1970s and was a founder of  Portable Theatre Company, a touring company concentrating on experimental theatre.  In the mid-1970s, he served as dramaturge to the Royal Shakespeare Company and produced one of his best-regarded plays, The Soul of the White Ant.  In 1978, his surrealist play The Glad Hand attracted favourable notice, as did his 1994 play, Darwin's Flood, among others.  He continued to write plays and screenplays until the end of his life, including for the Bush Theatre.  He also wrote several novels and held teaching positions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 2", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Snoo Wilson, English playwright and screenwriter (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "July 3", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Snoo Wilson, English playwright and screenwriter (b. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Alan Rickman", "response": ["After graduating from RADA, Rickman worked extensively with British repertory and experimental theatre groups in productions including Chekhov's The Seagull and Snoo Wilson's The Grass Widow at the Royal Court Theatre, and appeared three times at the Edinburgh International Festival.
