Their first appearance in List A cricket was in 1969, and in total they have played thirty-three matches, making five Gillette Cup, nineteen NatWest Trophy and nine Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy appearances. On five occasions the county progressed to the third round of the competition: in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Minor counties teams were excluded from the competition from the 2006 season; Devon's last match was against Essex in the first round of the 2004 competition.In their thirty-three List A matches, 101 players have represented Devon. Andrew Pugh has appeared the most times for the county, playing in eighteen matches, closely followed by Nick Folland, who made sixteen appearances. Robert Dawson recorded the highest score in List A cricket for Devon, scoring 139 runs against Cumberland in 2002. Dawson, who played 64 first-class matches for Gloucestershire is Devons's leading run-scorer, having scored 492 runs in his thirteen appearances for the county. Andrew Procter's fourteen wickets for the county is the most by any player, but Robert Healey has the best bowling figures, having taken six wickets against Hertfordshire in his only match in 1969.
