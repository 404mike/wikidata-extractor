Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies be in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo's math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal."]}, {"page": "Economics", "response": ["Keynesian economics has two successors.

Alexander Nove argued that Mises \"tends to spoil his case by the implicit assumption that capitalism and optimum resource allocation go together\" in Mises' \"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\". Joan Robinson argued that many prices in modern capitalism are effectively \"administered prices\" created by \"quasi monopolies\", thus challenging the connection between capital markets and rational resource allocation. Robin Hahnel argued that free markets are in fact systematically inefficient because externalities are pervasive and because real-world markets are rarely truly competitive or in equilibrium.Hahnel, Robin (2007). \"The Case Against Markets\". Journal of Economic Issues. 41 (4): 1139\u20131159. Socialist market abolitionists argue that whilst advocates of capitalism and the Austrian School in particular recognize equilibrium prices do not exist, they nonetheless claim that these prices can be used as a rational basis when this is not the case, hence markets are not efficient.", "Joan Robinson argued that in a steady-state economy there would be an effective abundance of means of production and so markets would not be needed. Mises acknowledged such a theoretical possibility in his original tract when he said the following: \"The static state can dispense with economic calculation. For here the same events in economic life are ever recurring; and if we assume that the first disposition of the static socialist economy follows on the basis of the final state of the competitive economy, we might at all events conceive of a socialist production system which is rationally controlled from an economic point of view.\" However, he contended that stationary conditions never prevail in the real world. Changes in economic conditions are inevitable; and even if they were not, the transition to socialism would be so chaotic as to preclude the existence of such a steady-state from the start."]}, {"page": "Keynesian economics", "response": ["Samuelson's treatment closely follows Joan Robinson's account of 1937Introduction to the Theory of Employment, which she described as a \"told-to-the-children\" account (letter to Keynes included in his Collected Writings vol XXIX, p185), referring to a series of retellings of classic stories. and is the main channel by which the multiplier has influenced Keynesian theory. It differs significantly from Kahn's paper and even more from Keynes's book.", "Keynes introduces his discussion of the multiplier in Chapter 10 with a reference to Kahn's earlier paper (see below). He designates Kahn's multiplier the \"employment multiplier\" in distinction to his own \"investment multiplier\" and says that the two are only \"a little different\".p. 115. Kahn's multiplier has consequently been understood by much of the Keynesian literature as playing a major role in Keynes's own theory, an interpretation encouraged by the difficulty of understanding Keynes's presentation. Kahn's multiplier gives the title (\"The multiplier model\") to the account of Keynesian theory in Samuelson's Economics\u202f and is almost as prominent in Alvin Hansen's Guide to Keynes\u202f and in Joan Robinson's Introduction to the Theory of Employment.", "Joan Robinson commented that:"]}, {"page": "Labor theory of value", "response": ["Some post-Keynesian economists have been highly critical of the labor theory of value. Joan Robinson, who herself was considered an expert on the writings of Karl Marx, wrote that the labor theory of value was largely a tautology and \"a typical example of the way metaphysical ideas operate\".Joan Robinson, \"Economic Philosophy\" p39 The well-known Marxian economist Roman Rosdolsky replied to Robinson's claims at length,Rosdolsky, Roman. The Making of Marx's Capital, Ch. 33 arguing that Robinson failed to understand key components of Marx's theory; for instance, Robinson argued that \"Marx's theory, as we have seen, rests on the assumption of a constant rate of exploitation\",Robinson, Joan Essay on Marxian Economics, p. 38 but as Rosdolsky points out, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.Marx, Karl. Capital, Vol. 3, Ch. 14. Here Marx directly contradicts Robinson's claim by addressing, at length, \"The Increasing Intensity of Exploitation\"", "In ecological economics, the labor theory of value has been criticized, where it is argued that labor is in fact energy over time.Anson Rabinbach, \"The human motor: Energy, fatigue, and the origins of modernity\" Such arguments generally fail to recognize that Marx is inquiring into social relations among human beings, which cannot be reduced to the expenditure of energy, just as democracy cannot be reduced to the expenditure of energy that a voter makes in getting to the polling place.Rubin, Isaak Illich Essays on Marx's Theory of Value, Ch. 14 However, echoing Joan Robinson, Alf Hornborg, an environmental historian, argues that both the reliance on \"energy theory of value\" and \"labor theory of value\" are problematic as they propose that use-values (or material wealth) are more \"real\" than exchange-values (or cultural wealth)--yet, use-values are culturally determined.Jean Baudrillard, \"Pour une critique de l'\u00e9conomie politique du signe\" For Hornborg, any Marxist argument that claims uneven wealth is due to the \"exploitation\" or \"underpayment\" of use-values is actually a tautological contradiction, since it must necessarily quantify \"underpayment\" in terms of exchange-value. The alternative would be to conceptualize unequal exchange as \"an asymmetric net transfer of material inputs in production (e.g., embodied labor, energy, land, and water), rather than in terms of an underpayment of material inputs or an asymmetric transfer of 'value'\". In other words, uneven exchange is characterised by incommensurability, namely: the unequal transfer of material inputs; competing value-judgements of the worth of labor, fuel, and raw materials; differing availability of industrial technologies; and the off-loading of environmental burdens on those with less resources."]}, {"page": "Monopolistic competition", "response": ["Monopolistic competition is a type of imperfect competition such that there are many producers competing against each other, but selling products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. If this happens in the presence of coercive government, monopolistic competition will fall into government-granted monopoly. Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity. Models of monopolistic competition are often used to model industries. Textbook examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities. The \"founding father\" of the theory of monopolistic competition is Edward Hastings Chamberlin, who wrote a pioneering book on the subject, Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933). Joan Robinson published a book The Economics of Imperfect Competition with a comparable theme of distinguishing perfect from imperfect competition. Further work on monopolistic competition was undertaken by Dixit and Stiglitz who created the Dixit-Stiglitz model which has proved applicable used in the sub fields of international trade theory, macroeconomics and economic geography."]}, {"page": "Milton Friedman", "response": ["Friedman spent the 1954\u20131955 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.

Che Guevara, then a Cuban government minister, visited North Korea in 1960, and proclaimed it a model for Cuba to follow. In 1965, the British economist Joan Robinson described North Korea's economic development as a \"miracle\". As late as the 1970s, its GDP per capita was estimated to be equivalent to South Korea's. By 1968, all homes had electricity, though the supply was unreliable. By 1972, all children from age 5 to 16 were enrolled in school, and over 200 universities and specialized colleges had been established.

Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, with the nearly simultaneous publication of their respective books, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933) and The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933), introduced models of imperfect competition. Theories of market forms and industrial organization grew out of this work. They also emphasized certain tools, such as the marginal revenue curve. In her book, Robinson formalized a type of limited competition. The conclusions of her work for welfare economics were worrying: they were implying that the market mechanism operates in a way that the workers are not paid according to the full value of their marginal productivity of labor and that also the principle of consumer sovereignty is impaired. This theory heavily influenced the anti\u2013trust policies of many Western countries in the 1940s and 1950s.SCREPANTI, E. and ZAMAGNI, S. (2005) An Outline of the History of Economic Thought. Second Edition. New York: Oxford University Press Inc. pp. 277.", "Joan Robinson's work on imperfect competition, at least, was a response to certain problems of Marshallian partial equilibrium theory highlighted by Piero Sraffa. Anglo-American economists also responded to these problems by turning towards general equilibrium theory, developed on the European continent by Walras and Vilfredo Pareto. J. R. Hicks's Value and Capital (1939) was influential in introducing his English-speaking colleagues to these traditions. He, in turn, was influenced by the Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek's move to the London School of Economics, where Hicks then studied."]}, {"page": "1903", "response": ["* October 31 \u2013 Joan Robinson, English economist (d. 1983)"]}, {"page": "Utility", "response": ["Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously criticized utility for being a circular concept: \"Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility.\" Robinson also pointed out that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption. This is so because if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences. This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher Hans Albert who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing. In essence, demand and supply curve (theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price) is purely ontological and could never have been demonstrated empirically."]}]}}
