William Vane from 1792 to 1813, The Hon. William Powlett from 1813 to 1827 and Lord William Powlett from 1827 to 1864, was a British politician.\nVane was the son of William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland and his first wife, Katherine, the second daughter and coheiress of Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton.

On inheriting the dukedom of Cleveland from his childless brother Henry in 1864, he resumed the surname of Vane. Also dying childless a few months later, his titles passed to his younger brother, Harry, who took the name of Powlett shortly after. Late in life, he lived at Harewood House, at Cheapside, in Berkshire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
