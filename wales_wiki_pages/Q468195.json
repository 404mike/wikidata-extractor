He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany.\nMalo was baptized as an adult by Brendan the Navigator and became his student. As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales, Malo was known for his participation in the Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot. As an immigrant to Brittany, he helped in the missionary work of Aaron of Brittany, was the first bishop of Aleth (modern Saint-Servan, France) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint-Malo in his honor. Malo was later driven from the area to Saintes, France by opponents of his mission.\nDetails of Malo's career have been preserved in three medieval 'Lives' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name. It appears that Malo was probably born in Wales in approximately 520.\nMalo's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou, a compound of mach \"warrant, hostage\" and lou (or loh) \"brilliant, bright, beautiful\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of saints", "response": ["| Malo"]}, {"page": "November 15", "response": ["* 621 \u2013 Malo, Breton bishop and saint", "** Malo"]}, {"page": "621", "response": ["* November 15 \u2013 Malo, Welsh bishop "]}, {"page": "520", "response": ["* Malo, Welsh bishop (approximate date)"]}, {"page": "Brittany", "response": ["From the 15th to the 18th century, Brittany reached an economic golden age. The region was located on the seaways near Spain, England and the Netherlands and it greatly benefited from the creation of a French colonial empire. Local seaports like Brest and Saint-Brieuc quickly expanded, and Lorient, first spelled \"L'Orient\", was founded in the 17th century. Saint-Malo then was known for its corsairs, Brest was a major base for the French Navy and Nantes flourished with the Atlantic slave trade. On its side, the inland provided hemp ropes and canvas and linen sheets. However, Colbertism, which encouraged the creation of many factories, did not favour the Breton industry because most of the royal factories were opened in other provinces. Moreover, several conflicts between France and England led the latter to restrain its trade, and the Breton economy went into recession during the 18th century.", "Brittany lost 240,000 men during the First World War. The Second World War was also catastrophic for the region. It was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940 and freed after Operation Cobra in August 1944.

The population in Region Brittany had grown by 0.9% between 1999 and 2000, and the growth rate reached more than 1% in Ille-et-Vilaine and Morbihan. The region around Rennes and the south are the more attractive areas, whereas the population is declining in the centre and in the westernmost parts. While most of the metropolitan areas are growing, the cities themselves tend to stagnate or regress, such as for Brest, Lorient, Saint-Brieuc and Saint-Malo.

At the same period, the wealthy ship-owners from Saint-Malo built many mansions called \"Malouini\u00e8res\" around their town. Along the coast, Vauban and other French architects designed several citadels, such as in Le Palais and Port-Louis. In rural areas, Breton houses remained simple, with a single floor and a longhouse pattern. They were built with local materials: mostly granite in Lower Brittany and schist in Upper Brittany. Slates and reeds were usually used for roofing. During the 19th century, the Breton architecture was mainly characterised by the Gothic Revival and Eclecticism. Clisson, the southernmost Breton town, was rebuilt in an Italian Romantic style around 1820. The Breton lighthouses were mostly built during the 19th century.
