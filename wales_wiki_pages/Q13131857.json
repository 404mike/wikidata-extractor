After the outbreak of war, on 4 August 1914, Hardie's spirited anti-war speeches often received opposition in the form of loud heckling. Hardie was among many Scottish socialists, the likes of John MacLean and Willie Gallacher, who opposed to the War and believed that working-class men fighting other working-class men only served the interests of capitalism.  After a series of strokes Hardie died in hospital in Glasgow of Pneumonia at noon on 26 September 1915, aged 59.Keir Hardie Death Certificate - Scotland's people His friend and fellow pacifist Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais) delivered the sermon at Hardie's memorial service at Aberdare, in his constituency."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais) (1879\u20131971)"]}, {"page": "1971 in Wales", "response": ["*19 April \u2013 Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais), writer and political activist, 91"]}, {"page": "Charles Stanton", "response": ["Stanton fought the \"Coupon\" general election of December 1918 for the Aberdare Division, as a National Democratic and Labour Party candidate, with the support of the Coalition National Government \"coupon\".

Welsh remained strong in the north west and in parts of mid Wales and south-west Wales. Rural Wales was a stronghold of the Welsh language \u2013 and so also were the industrial slate-quarrying communities of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire.See: R. Merfyn Jones, The North Wales Quarrymen, 1874\u20131922. Bethesda and Dinorwig were the largest slate quarries in the world and the largest industrial concerns in North Wales. Welsh was the working language of the quarries and of the North Wales Quarry Workers' Union. It was also the language of the quarry communities. Many of the leading Welsh literary figures of the late 19th and 20thC had their roots in these quarrying communities \u2013 e.g. Kate Roberts; T. H. Parry-Williams; R. Williams Parry; Thomas Parry; W J Gruffydd; Silyn Roberts; T Rowland Hughes; Ifor Williams; Gwenlyn Parry \u2013 as did a number of leading Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, including Cledwyn Hughes and Goronwy Roberts. Even in the industrial south east, the continuing strength of the Welsh language led the Independent Labour Party in 1911 to include Welsh language pages in the Merthyr Pioneer \u2013 edited at Keir Hardie's request by Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais). Many of the non-conformist churches throughout Wales were strongly associated with the Welsh language."]}, {"page": "T E Nicholas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Evan Nicholas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais)"]}, {"page": "Glais", "response": ["Thomas Evan Nicholas, the famous Welsh poet and radical, known as Niclas y Glais, was a minister at Seion Chapel in Glais between 1904 and 1914.
