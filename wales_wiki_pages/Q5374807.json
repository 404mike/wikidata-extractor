At the 1850 general election, the sitting member, W.W.E. Wynne of Peniarth, was challenged by the Liberal, David Williams. In an election characterised by allegations of coercion against the nonconformist tenantry, Wynne held the seat by a small majority. In 1865, Wynne stood down, and was succeeded as Conservative candidate by his son, W.R.M. Wynne. Against some expectations, he held the seat with a slightly reduced majority, and this was attributed by Ieuan Gwynedd Jones to 'a sense of terror' that had struck the mainly nonconformist tenant farmers.   In 1868, following the extension of the franchise, Wynne withdrew rather than face another contest which he was likely to lose. With the introduction of the secret ballot, Merioneth became one of the safest Liberal seats in Wales \u2013 mainly the effect of the high number of workers in the slate and limestone quarries round Ffestiniog and Corwen. With the foundation of the Labour Party, the seat became less safe, but the Liberals held it through the first half of the 20th century, losing it to Labour, when Emrys Roberts was defeated by T.W. Jones. The Liberals remained the main challengers until the 1960s. However, with the emergence of Plaid Cymru as a political force, Merioneth was natural territory for the nationalists: they overtook the Liberals for second place behind Labour in 1970, and then Dafydd Elis-Thomas captured the seat at the February 1974 election, one of the first two seats the party had won at a general election.

This group of seven has been described by a prominent historian of Welsh Liberalism, J. Graham Jones, as \"a disparate team. lacking in cohesion and a common political philosophy\". Emrys Roberts and Megan Lloyd George were increasingly close to Labour on issues such as the formation of the National Health Service. In contrast, Lady Megan's brother Gwilym, who represented Pembrokeshire, drifted towards the Conservatives and had the Liberal whip withdrawn in 1946. Clement Davies, who became party leader in 1945, and had represented Montgomeryshire since 1929, had been a member of the Liberal faction led by Sir John Simon in the 1930s but had subsequently become more radical in his views. Rhys Hopkin Morris, who won Carmarthen from Labour against the tide in 1945, was fiercely independent in his views, while Roderic Bowen, elected for the first time in Cardiganshire in 1945, was at the time an unknown quantity.

Gruffydd, who had defeated former Plaid Cymru president Saunders Lewis in a fiercely contested by-election in 1943. Despite these differences within the group, the fact remained that the rural west and north Wales was now one of the party's last remaining sources of significant support. To some extent this reflected the continuing correlation between Liberalism and nonconformity, although it has been suggested that the connection was sustained more by habit than conviction.", "During the 1945-50 Parliament the Liberal MPs for Wales often disagreed amongst themselves on their attitudes towards Labour policies and often voted in different ways. The 1951 General Election was the end of an era for Welsh radical Liberalism as both Lady Megan Lloyd George and Emrys Roberts lost their seats in Anglesey and Merioneth respectively. The three remaining Welsh Liberal MPs were on the right of the party and, for several elections, did not face Conservative opposition in their constituencies.", ":1949: Emrys Roberts"]}, {"page": "Emrys", "response": ["*Emrys Roberts (1910\u20131990), Welsh Liberal politician and businessman", "*Emrys Roberts (poet) (1929\u20132012), Archdruid and poet"]}, {"page": "1976 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Emrys Roberts, , Chairman, Mid-Wales New Town Development Corporation."]}, {"page": "Glyn Tegai Hughes", "response": ["In 1950 Hughes was a founding member of Undeb Cymru Fydd, an all-party organisation that was created to campaign for a parliament for Wales. Apart from Hughes, the organisation had support from many other leading Welsh Liberals such as Emrys Roberts and Megan Lloyd George who served as the organisation's President. The campaign strategy involved the collection of a nationwide petition to present to the British parliament. The campaign also involved the holding of public meetings at which Hughes was a regular platform speaker. He was critical of how the organisation was created without any full-time staff and of the way the campaign was launched. Although the petition was signed by 250,000 people he did not think that this truly reflected the degree of support in Wales for their own parliament and believed that a referendum on the issue in the 1950s would have been lost. The overwhelming majority of Welsh MPs in the 1950s were Labour Party members who opposed the campaign. When the petition was presented to Parliament before the 1955 general election there was also a debate on the issue of creating a Welsh Parliament that was also backed by Liberal Party Leader Clement Davies.
