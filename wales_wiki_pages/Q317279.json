He was the last native Welshman to hold the title Prince of Wales (Welsh: Tywysog Cymru).\nOwain Glynd\u0175r was a descendant of the Princes of Powys through his father Gruffudd Fychan II, hereditary Tywysog of Powys Fadog and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy. Through his mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywellyn he was a descendant of the Princes of Deheubarth, and through her he was also a descendant of Llywellyn the Great of the Gwynedd royal house of Aberffraw.On 16 September 1400, Owain Glynd\u0175r instigated a 15-year Welsh Revolt against the rule of King Henry IV of England. With the use of guerilla tactics the Welsh troops managed to inflict a series of devastating defeats on the English forces and captured key castles across Wales, rapidly gaining control of most of the Country. News of the rebellions success spread internationally across Europe and Glyndwr began receiving naval support from Scotland and Brittany, He also received the support of King Charles VI of France who agreed to send French troops and supplies to aid the rebellion. In 1403 a Welsh army including a French contingent assimilated into forces mainly from Morgannwg and the Rhondda Valleys region commanded by Owain Glyndwr, His senior General Rhys Gethin and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda defeated a large English invasion force reputedly led by King Henry IV himself at the battle of Stalling Down in Glamorgan, South Wales. \nBy 1404 no less than four royal military expeditions into Wales had been repelled and Owain solidified his control of the Nation. He was officially crowned Prince Of Wales and held a Parliament at Machynlleth where he outlined his National Programme for Wales, which included plans such as building two National Universities (One in the South and one in the North), re introducing the traditional Welsh laws of Hywel Dda and establishing an independent Welsh Church. There were also envoys from several other Countries such as Spain, France and Scotland present. \nDespite the initial success of the revolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources and wealth that England had at its disposal eventually began to turn the tide of the war, and the much larger and better equipped English forces began to overwhelm the Welsh and eventually by 1409 they had reconquered most of Wales. Glynd\u0175r fought on until he was cornered and under siege at Harlech Castle, however he managed to escape capture by disguising himself as an elderly man, sneaking out of the castle and slipping past the English military blockade in the darkness of the night. Owain retreated to the Welsh wilderness with a band of loyal supporters, he refused to surrender and continued the war with guerilla tactics such as launching sporadic raids and ambushes throughout Wales and the English borderlands. The last documented sighting of him was in 1412 when he ambushed the kings men in Brecon and captured and ransomed a leading supporter of King Henry's. He twice ignored offers of a pardon from the new king Henry V of England, and despite the large rewards offered for his capture, Glynd\u0175r was never betrayed to the English. His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415, at the age of approximately 56.\nWith his death, Owain acquired a mythical status along with Cadwaladr, Cynan and Arthur as a folk hero awaiting the call to return and liberate his people. In William Shakespeare's play Henry IV, Part 1, the character of Owen Glendower is a wild and exotic king ruled by magic and emotion. In the late 19th century, the Cymru Fydd movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abergavenny", "response": ["Owain Glynd\u0175r attacked Abergavenny in 1404.

They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as \"Traitors' Lane\" thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by Ieuan ab Owain Glynd\u0175r, illegitimate son of Owain Glynd\u0175r.

Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending English claim to the French throne.", "Less than three years later, Henry was in command of part of the English forces. He led his own army into Wales against Owain Glynd\u0175r and joined forces with his father to fight Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. It was there that the 16-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow that became stuck in his face. An ordinary soldier might have died from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care. Over a period of several days, John Bradmore, the royal physician, treated the wound with honey to act as an antiseptic, crafted a tool to screw into the embedded arrowhead (bodkin tip) and thus extract it without doing further damage, and flushed the wound with alcohol. The operation was successful, but it left Henry with permanent scars, evidence of his experience in battle.. Bradmore recorded this account in Latin, in his manuscript titled Philomena. Henry's treatment also appeared in an anonymous Middle English surgical treatise dated to 1446, that has since been attributed to Thomas Morstede.", "The Welsh revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r absorbed Henry's energies until 1408. Then, as a result of the king's ill health, Henry began to take a wider share in politics. From January 1410, helped by his uncles Henry and Thomas Beaufort, legitimised sons of John of Gaunt, he had practical control of the government. Both in foreign and domestic policy he differed from the king, who discharged his son from the council in November 1411. The quarrel of father and son was political only, though it is probable that the Beauforts had discussed the abdication of Henry IV. Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.", "Henry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs. A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by ecclesiastical statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glynd\u0175r were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace. King Charles VI of France was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and his eldest surviving son was an unpromising prospect. However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion."]}, {"page": "Monmouth", "response": ["From the 14th century onwards, the town became noted for the production of woollen Monmouth caps.

While the most powerful ruler was acknowledged as King of the Britons (later Tywysog Cymru: Leader or Prince of Wales), and some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, none were able to unite Wales for long. Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English and later, the Norman conquerors of England, led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. In 1282, the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd led to the conquest of the Principality of Wales by King Edward I of England; afterwards, the heir apparent to the English monarch has borne the title \"Prince of Wales\". The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, the last significant one being that led by Owain Glynd\u0175r in the early 15th century. In the 16th century Henry VIII, himself of Welsh extraction as a great grandson of Owen Tudor, passed the Laws in Wales Acts aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the Kingdom of England. Under England's authority, Wales became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. The publication of the extremely significant first complete Welsh translation of the Bible by William Morgan in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a literary language.", "In 1400, a Welsh nobleman, Owain Glynd\u0175r (or Owen Glendower), revolted against King Henry IV of England. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. Some of his achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at Machynlleth and plans for two universities. Eventually the king's forces were able to regain control of Wales and the rebellion died out, but Owain himself was never captured.

The first Percy rebellion ended in the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. In this battle, Henry's eldest son, Henry of Monmouth, was wounded by an arrow in his face.

This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles were by no means useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glynd\u0175r's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15th\u00a0century, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.", "As a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about  and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37\u00a0archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\u0175r's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective."]}, {"page": "River Severn", "response": ["In Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy recalls the valour of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March in a long battle against Welshman Owain Glynd\u0175r upon the banks of the Severn, claiming the flooding Severn \"affrighted with [the warriors'] bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, bloodstained with these valiant combatants.\""]}, {"page": "Glamorgan", "response": ["The kingdom of Glamorgan was also notable for the number of castles built during the time of the Marcher Lords, many surviving to the present day though many are now ruinous.

Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north\u2013south trade route.  Evidence of Romano-British ritual burials have been found under the present cathedral.  The date of the moving of the cathedral to Llandaff is disputed, but elements of the fabric date from the 12th century, such as the impressive Romanesque Urban Arch, named after the 12th century Bishop, Urban.  It has had a history of continual destruction and restoration, as a result of warfare, neglect, and natural disaster.  Llandaff has been a focal point of devastating attacks by Owain Glynd\u0175r and Oliver Cromwell.  It was the second most damaged cathedral in the UK (after Coventry Cathedral), following Luftwaffe bombing during World War II, and subsequently restored by the architect George Pace.  One of its main modern points of interest is the aluminium figure of Christ in Majesty (1954\u20135), by Jacob Epstein, which is suspended above the nave.
