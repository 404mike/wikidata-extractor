That year both he and his team mate Davies qualified for the Great Britain team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the men's single class 1 event. At the London Paralympics, Davies was placed in group C, along with Andrea Borgato of Italy and Andreas Vevera of Austria. He beat Borgato in straight sets, but Vevera was a harder prospect, Davies coming from 2\u20131 down to win by three sets to two. This allowed Davies to progress to the semi-finals where he met eventual gold medalist Holger Nikelis of Germany. Nikelis was too strong an opponent on the day, beating Davies in straight sets. Although out of the top medal positions, Davies was placed into bronze medal contention, facing the other semi-final loser, Lee Chang Ho of South Korea.
