Arkwright is a devious, and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his store having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all cost. He is also very protective of his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered Oxo tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were \"solid silver\". He is so protective of his money that the last time he spent a whole night away from the shop was in 1957, when he went to have his appendix removed. The shop's old till possesses a tight spring-clip that regularly puts Arkwright and Granville's fingers in danger. Arkwright refuses to replace it because of the cost of a replacement and because it deters thieves. Although an avid political commentator, he has few political convictions and never sides with either the left or right wing, instead implying they are all useless. Arkwright does however seem fervently opposed to nationalisation, once commenting \"My top lip went all stiff and dead, as if it had been nationalised.\" His political comments usually show no allegiances, instead making remarks like When Wales get home rule, do you think they'll nationalise Clive Jenkins?"]}, {"page": "John Dutton (trade unionist)", "response": ["Clive Jenkins was elected as secretary of the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians in 1960, and Dutton began negotiating a merger between the two unions.
