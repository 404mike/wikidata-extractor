She finished in fourth in her first race, and on the podium in her second race, being partnered by Ginetta's Mark Simpson, as Evans had encountered licensing issues. The season would prove to be a successful one; although a victory eluded the pairing of Evans and Wenham, she was still competing for the title with two races to go (with Evans competing for the runner-up spot, having entered two less races). Following that event, however, Wenham had to settle for second place, the title being won by Team WFR (and their driver pairing of Jody Fannin and Warren Hughes), with Wenham stating that her debut season had \"been absolutely amazing\"."]}, {"page": "Dom Evans", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dominic Evans"]}]}}
