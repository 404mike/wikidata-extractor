Most of his archive consisted of thousands of portraits of major league baseball players, however his most famous photo is a fortunate action shot of Ty Cobb sliding into third base at Hilltop Park in 1910, upending the fielder, Jimmy Austin. This photo, and many of his images, of baseball's early stars are instantly recognizable, due to having been frequently reprinted over the years and the subject of several books, trading cards and documentaries.  The Cobb photo is considered the first \"action\" sports photo.", "Conlon was actually on the field, being a common practice of the day, \"behind third base, under the hood of a large, tripod-supported Graflex camera\".  He was positioned to the outfield side of the third base coach's box, in foul territory. Cobb was on second. New York third baseman Jimmy Austin was playing in for a possible sacrifice bunt. Cobb took off for third, directly toward Conlon, but the batter did not get the bunt down. Austin backpedaled to take the throw from the catcher. Cobb tipped Austin over and the catcher's throw sailed away into left field. Presumably Cobb could have gotten up and scored, but the book does not elaborate."]}, {"page": "List of Baltimore Orioles team records", "response": ["*Sacrifice Hits: Jimmy Austin, 223"]}, {"page": "1936 in baseball", "response": ["*May 23 \u2013 Ted Lewis, 63, pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters and Boston Americans from 1896 to 1901, who led the National League with a .768 Win-Loss % in 1898, and also one of only three Welsh-born ballplayers in Major League history, along with Jimmy Austin and Peter Morris."]}]}}
