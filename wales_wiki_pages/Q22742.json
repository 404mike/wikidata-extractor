Their interracial wedding required a letter from Queen Victoria. Because of the marriage, Tsuneko Gauntlett became a British citizen, until 1941 when both Gauntletts became Japanese citizens, using the family name \"Ganto\" as an approximation of \"Gauntlett\". The Gauntletts had six children together; two of their daughters (Frances and Kathleen) remained British citizens and lived in Canada and England during World War II; two of their children (Winifred and Owen) married Japanese people and lived in Japan during the war; their daughter Amy lived in Japan with her South African husband, and their youngest son Trevor became a Japanese citizen in 1941."]}]}}
