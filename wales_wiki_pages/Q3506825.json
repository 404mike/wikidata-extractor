The original lineup featured Burke Shelley, Brian Goddard, Tony Bourge and Ray Phillips. By early 1970, Goddard had left the group because, according to Shelley, \"he got a girl pregnant and suddenly had to get a job\". The remaining trio released Budgie in 1971, Squawk in 1972 and Never Turn Your Back on a Friend in 1973. By the end of 1973, Phillips had left Budgie. He was replaced by Pete Boot, who debuted on In for the Kill! released the following year. After around a year with the band, Boot was replaced at the end of 1974 by Steve Williams. Bandolier, If I Were Brittania I'd Waive the Rules and Impeckable followed, before Bourge left in the summer of 1978. He later recalled that \"I would've loved to have carried on, but after a while the lifestyle gets to you.\"", "In early 1995, Burke Shelley and John Thomas reformed Budgie with drummer Robert \"Congo\" Jones (formerly of Love Sculpture) for a select number of American shows. The group reformed again in mid-1999, with Steve Williams returning on drums. In February 2002, Thomas was forced to leave the band after suffering a stroke which rendered him unable to perform effectively. He was replaced by Andy Hart, who debuted on Life in San Antonio recorded in the summer. The following March, Hart was forced to leave for \"personal reasons\".
