Rubin eventually talked them into rerecording the entire album. The band's record company, Beggars Banquet, was displeased with this, as two months and \u00a3250,000 had already been spent on the record. However, after hearing the initial New York recording, Beggars Banquet agreed to proceed. The first single, \"Love Removal Machine\", was released in February 1987, and the new version of the album appeared in April that year, now renamed as Electric, reaching No.\u00a04 and eventually outselling Love. The band toured with Kid Chaos (also known as \"Haggis\" and \"The Kid\") on bass, with Stewart on rhythm guitar. Two more singles, \"Lil Devil\" and \"Wild Flower\", were released during 1987. A few tracks from the original Peace album appeared on the single versions of \"Love Removal Machine\", and \"Lil Devil\". The full Peace album would not be released until 2000, when it was included as Disc 3 of the Rare Cult box set.", "In the US, the Cult, now consisting of Astbury, Duffy, Stewart, Warner and Kid Chaos, were supported by the then-unknown Guns N' Roses. The band also appeared at Roskilde Festival in Denmark in June 1987. When the world tour wound through Australia, the band wrecked \u00a330,000 worth of equipment, and as a result they could not tour Japan, as no company would rent them new equipment. At the end of the tour the Electric album had been certified Gold in the UK, and sold roughly 3 million copies worldwide, but the band were barely speaking to each other by then. Haggis left the band at the end of the Electric tour to form the Four Horsemen for Rubin's Def American label. Astbury and Duffy fired Warner and their management team Grant/Edwards, and moved to Los Angeles with original bassist Stewart. Warner sued the band several times for his firing, as well as for what he felt were unpaid royalties due to him for his performance on the Electric album, resulting in lengthy court battles. The Cult signed a new management deal and wrote 21 new songs for their next record."]}, {"page": "Borough of Manhattan Community College", "response": ["* Kid Chaos, rock musician"]}, {"page": "Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction", "response": ["The band is the brainchild of Mark Manning, a former graphic artist and art editor of the now defunct Flexipop! magazine. The magazine folded back in 1982 but the hedonistic lifestyle of the frequenting rock and pop stars to the magazine' offices fueled his desire to experience the debauchery of life as a decadent rock star. He joined another music publication called Metal Fury as a graphic designer but assumed the alter ego 'Zodiac Mindwarp' at night. 'Zodiac Mindwarp' was the namesake of a series of underground comics written and illustrated by Spain Rodriquez. Zodiac soon left Metal Fury and formed the Love Reaction in 1985 with Jimmy Cauty (who later formed The Orb, The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and The KLF) on guitar; Kid Chaos (real name Stephen Harris) on bass; and Boom Boom Kaboomski on drums.", "The band was signed to the Food label of Phonogram Records who soon issued their first recording, \"Wild Child\" with just Zodiac (playing guitar and vocals), Kid Chaos on bass and Jake Le Mesurier on drums. A demo version of \"High Priest of Love\" was included on the Melody Maker Vinyl Conflict 2 free EP in September 1986. By the end of the year the lineup had changed again to accommodate the still present figure of Cobalt Stargazer (real name Geoff Bird) and new drummer Slam Thunderhide (real name Stephen Landrum). That lineup contributed the studio track, \"Drug Shoes,\" to the FOOD Imminent 2 various artists compilation.", "Zodiac Mindwarp progressed rapidly from their first gig at Dingwalls in November 1985, to playing in front of a packed Reading Festival in 1986, but was followed by the departure of Kid Chaos who joined The Cult. Zodiac regrouped by assigning Trash D Garbage on Bass and Flash Bastard (Jan Cyrka) on rhythm guitar section. The expanded five member outfit all went on to record Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction's debut album in 1988 entitled Tattooed Beat Messiah. Other band members playing bass include Suzi X, Tex Diablo and Kev Reverb; whilst previous drummers were Robbie Vomm and The Apocalypse."]}, {"page": "Olchfa School", "response": ["* Stephen Harris, rock musician with stage name \"Kid Chaos\""]}, {"page": "Jamie Stewart (bassist)", "response": ["Following the recording of the band's third long-player, Electric, in 1987, the band felt that a second guitarist was needed on tour to reproduce the music of Electric. The role was filled by Stewart, having a familiarity with the songs and style, and being a former guitarist. For the tours, Kid Chaos (formerly of Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction) was recruited as bassist."]}, {"page": "The Four Horsemen (band)", "response": ["The Four Horsemen were formed in the late 1980s by the Welsh-born guitarist Stephen Harris (a.k.a. Kid Chaos a.k.a. \"Haggis\"), who had been a member of Zodiac Mindwarp and a touring bassist for The Cult. Haggis formed the band in Hollywood, California, when he decided to leave The Cult, switching from bass to rhythm guitar. He had previously worked with Rick Rubin, the producer of the Electric album for the Cult, who introduced Haggis to the vocalist Frank Starr. Rubin also suggested the drummer Ken \"Dimwit\" Montgomery to Haggis.
