The episode was written by returning series guest writer, Helen Raynor, directed by Andy Goddard and produced by Richard Stokes. As with all episodes of Torchwoods first two series, \"To the Last Man\" featured series regulars John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Burn Gorman, Naoko Mori and Gareth David Lloyd, with Mori's character Toshiko Sato given the main focus.", "Raynor was also inspired by the issue of World War I soldiers who were executed for cowardice when they were suffering from shellshock. One of the episode's working titles was \"Soldier's Heart\", an American Civil War term for shellshock. The final title recalls an infamous order from Field Marshal Douglas Haig on 11 April 1918, in response to the German spring offensive, which included the phrase: \"Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement\". This policy led shell-shocked soldiers, like the fictional Tommy, to be sent back to war after a very short recuperation period.Walker, \"Part Six: Episode Guide-2.03: To the Last Man\" p. 137 Director Andy Goddard felt that a scene in which Tommy watches footage of the Iraq War was key to the episode; this experience tells Tommy that the human condition has not changed since 1918 and that humanity still makes the same mistakes. During the episode, Jack suggests that the British army executed \"more than 300\" shell-shocked soldiers for cowardice during the First World War. Executions for all offences numbered 346, of which 40 were for murder or mutiny. The remaining 306 were for desertion (266), cowardice (18), and other offences (22). While some of these can now be attributed to shell shock, most cannot, although all 306 were posthumously pardoned in 2006.Time Online - War pardon will clear rogues and innocents, 9 September 2006BBC History: Shot at Dawn - Cowards, Traitors or Victims? - The case against a pardon Early drafts of the episode included Tommy asking for Suzie Costello, a member of the Torchwood Institute who had committed suicide in the series' 2006 premiere episode. In regards to the sensitive material in the episode, actress Naoko Mori stated that whilst reading the script she \"kind of forgot it was Torchwood and [that] it was science-fiction\". She found the climax of the episode \"heartbreaking\"."]}, {"page": "Marc Streitenfeld", "response": ["|Andy Goddard"]}, {"page": "Jamie de Courcey", "response": ["| 2006 || Wire in the Blood || Directed by Andy Goddard"]}, {"page": "Goddard (surname)", "response": ["* Andy Goddard (born 1968), British film director and screenwriter"]}]}}
