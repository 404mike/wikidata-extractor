In 1918 she started training at the Slade School of Art in London on a scholarship of \u00a320 and in 1926 won the Prix de Rome for her etching The Adoration of the Shepherds, which was subsequently shown at the Royal Academy. She studied under Henry Tonks (1862-1937), Philip Wilson Steer (1860-1942) and John Wheatley (1892-1955). At this time she was living at 40 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, N.W, the same house where Mark Rutherford, the novelist, lived in 1852. When she visited South Africa in 1935, her former teacher at the Slade School, Professor John Laviers Wheatley, offered her a teaching post at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town. She founded the school's printmaking and engraving department. In 1938 she accepted the post of Senior Lecturer in Fine Art at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, where she remained until 1957. From here she made frequent painting trips to the Drakensberg and Transkei, occasionally accompanied by her friend and fellow painter, Phyllis McCarthy. The Centre for Visual Art at the University of Natal has been entrusted with a donation of her works.

She spent some time in Newlyn before moving back to London where she established her career as an artist. In 1910 the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool purchased her watercolour on ivory The Lady Clarissa and a similar drawing Seated Women, from 1913, is in the Tate collection. Wheatley became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy showing there numerous times between 1914 and 1964. She also showed with the Royal Miniature Society and at the New English Art Club of which she became an elected member in 1921. In 1912 she married the painter John Laviers Wheatley and in 1925 the couple moved to South Africa. There Edith Grace Wheatley was the senior lecturer in Fine Art at the University of Cape Town while John Wheatley was a professor at the same institution and became director of the National Gallery of South Africa. Edith also completed several public commissions while in Cape Town. These included a sculpture for the city's new law courts plus wall and ceiling paintings for the entrance to the National Gallery. The couple remained in South Africa until 1937 when they returned to England and settled in Sheffield. During World War II Edith Grace Wheatley was commissioned to depict the war's impact on the local steel industry. To this end she greatly changed her painting style. The resulting large paintings, Forging six-pounder shell bodies, Kilnhurst steel works and The tyre mill, Kilnhurst steel works, were shown at the Royal Academy in 1945 and 1946 respectively."]}]}}
