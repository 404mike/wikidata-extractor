Welsh remained strong in the north west and in parts of mid Wales and south-west Wales. Rural Wales was a stronghold of the Welsh language \u2013 and so also were the industrial slate-quarrying communities of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire.See: R. Merfyn Jones, The North Wales Quarrymen, 1874\u20131922. Bethesda and Dinorwig were the largest slate quarries in the world and the largest industrial concerns in North Wales. Welsh was the working language of the quarries and of the North Wales Quarry Workers' Union. It was also the language of the quarry communities. Many of the leading Welsh literary figures of the late 19th and 20thC had their roots in these quarrying communities \u2013 e.g. Kate Roberts; T. H. Parry-Williams; R. Williams Parry; Thomas Parry; W J Gruffydd; Silyn Roberts; T Rowland Hughes; Ifor Williams; Gwenlyn Parry \u2013 as did a number of leading Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, including Cledwyn Hughes and Goronwy Roberts. Even in the industrial south east, the continuing strength of the Welsh language led the Independent Labour Party in 1911 to include Welsh language pages in the Merthyr Pioneer \u2013 edited at Keir Hardie's request by Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais). Many of the non-conformist churches throughout Wales were strongly associated with the Welsh language."]}, {"page": "David Lyn", "response": ["Lyn took the step of leaving London to try his hand at acting in his native Wales. Throughout this period alongside his acting Lyn also developed a side-line in renovating houses and when he moved his family to North Wales he bought five derelict cottages and knocked them through into one long house, fitting a large church window in the front of the last cottage giving the building the appearance of an old chapel. In 1965 Lyn toured Ireland in a production of Pinter's The Caretaker with the Welsh Theatre Company. In 1966 he joined Cwmni Theatr Cymru, the Welsh-language wing of the Welsh Theatre Company, in the Absurdist Saer Doliau (Doll Mender or Doll Doctor), a play by the Welsh playwright Gwenlyn Parry.  In 1972 Lyn purchased a 55ft 50 ton Norwegian trawler, the Tolga, which he intended to renovate to fulfil a promise to his father to take him up the Zambezi. He and his family worked on making the trawler seaworthy.", "As a boy Lyn had gained only a smattering of the Welsh language, and during this period he worked hard at the script to get his Welsh up to the standard necessary for him to be able to deliver the long speeches fluently. In this he was supported by his fellow cast members who made allowances for him at rehearsals. Over the ensuing years Lyn improved his knowledge of Welsh to such an extent that eventually he was able to act in and direct plays for  Cwmni Theatr Cymru fluently in that language; among the plays he directed were: Pethe Brau (1972), a Welsh language version of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams; Esther by Saunders Lewis (1973) and Y Twr (1978) by Gwenlyn Parry."]}, {"page": "Welsh Theatre Company", "response": ["Wilbert Lloyd Roberts, Head of Drama at the BBC in Cardiff, had directed Welsh language productions with a troupe of Welsh actors who worked for both the BBC and the Welsh Theatre Company.
