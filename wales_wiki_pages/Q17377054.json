He is remembered in the church of St Curig in Llangurig and the chapels called Capel Curig in Porthkerry, Langstone, Newport and Llanilid, all in Wales. The church of St. Julittas`s in Capel Curig is traditionally said to have been founded by him.\nCurig is thought to have migrated to Brittany at the end of his life and there are several churches there bearing his name. He is said to have died at Landerneau and been buried at Locquirec.He is commemorated on 16 June.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Capel Curig", "response": ["Capel Curig takes its name from the little St Julitta's Church in the ancient graveyard by the river bridge on the Llanberis road. This, confusingly, has been known for over 100 years as St Julitta's Church, and is currently being restored by the \"Friends of Saint Julitta\".  Tradition claims this chapel to be the 6th-century foundation of St Curig, a Celtic bishop.  Centuries later, probably when the present ancient church was built, the name appears to have been Latinised as Cyricus, which is the name of a 4th-century child martyr whose mother was Julitta. They are usually named together as Saints Quiricus and Julietta."]}, {"page": "List of churches in Powys", "response": ["|St Curig, Llangurig"]}, {"page": "List of Church in Wales churches", "response": ["|St Curig"]}]}}
