Shaw was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break.  He was born in Treharris, Glamorgan.\nShaw made his first-class debut for Glamorgan against the Combined Services in 1951.  He made 15 further first-class appearances for Glamorgan, the last of which came against Surrey in the 1955 County Championship.  A bowler, Shaw took 26 wickets for Glamorgan, at an average of 27.15, with best figures of 5/38.  These figures came in his second first-class match against the Combined Services in 1952, a match in which he also took his other five-wicket haul of 5/67, to give him match figures of 10/105.
