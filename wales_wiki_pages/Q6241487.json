Following an extensive day of rehearsals at Sound Techniques, Bunyan completed the entire Just Another Diamond Day album during a work-extensive three-day period in December 1969. Bunyan was joined by a wealth of musicians, including John James, Robert Kirby, Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band, and Dave Swarbrick and Simon Nicol of Fairport Convention. However, Bunyan's diffident approach resulted in her losing control of the songs' arrangements, and only later did she note her reservations toward the album's lack of precision and production. Music historian Richie Unterberger has remarked that despite the influence of outside artists, the drum-less, acoustic arrangements on Just Another Diamond Day complemented Bunyan's measured and wispy vocals.", "*John James \u2013 dulcitone (3, 8), organ (5)", "*John James \u2013 cover art"]}, {"page": "Stefan Grossman", "response": ["In 1967, Grossman travelled to Europe, as a first step on a planned journey to India which was not completed. In London he stayed at first with Eric Clapton whom he had met whilst in Chicago Loop and met guitarists and singers on the British folk scene including Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Davy Graham and Ralph McTell and The Young Tradition. He began playing in folk clubs around the country and made his first solo recordings for the Philips/Fontana label (Aunt Molly's Murray Farm and The Gramercy Park Sheikh) and then for Nathan Joseph's Transatlantic label, including Yazoo Basin Boogie and Ragtime Cowboy Jew (see discography). He also traveled widely in Europe and eventually settled in Italy, where he lived for seven years. Travelling around Europe for gigs brought him into contact with many other fine guitarists, but few of them had record deals. Grossman saw a niche in the market for solo acoustic guitar records which were accompanied by a tablature book to allow the buyer to try playing the arrangements and, with his friend Ed Denson taking care of the US side of business, founded Kicking Mule Records. Over the next few years KM released albums by such artists as John James, Happy Traum, Ton van Bergeyk, Dave Evans, Peter Finger and the late Sam Mitchell. Grossman also released his own original and instructional albums on KM, the latter including seminal works such as Fingerpicking Guitar Techniques, How To Play Ragtime Guitar and Famous Ragtime Guitar Solos which had a major influence on acoustic guitarists in Europe, the UK and the US. During these years Grossman was also touring as a solo artist and in partnership with John Renbourn and continuing to write and publish instructional books, often accompanied by the then new technology of a cassette tape."]}, {"page": "John James", "response": ["John James is the name of:", "* John James (writer) (1923\u20131993), British writer of historical novels", "* John James (poet) (1939\u20132018), British poet", "* John James (guitarist) (born 1947), Welsh fingerstyle guitarist", "* John James (actor) (born 1956), American television actor", "* John James (American poet) (born 1987)", "* John James (Canadian musician) (active 1980s\u20132016), Canadian dance musician", "* John James (active 1986\u20131997), Australian musician formerly associated with the band Newsboys", "* John James (MP for Wallingford), 1364\u20131378, Member of Parliament (MP) for Wallingford", "* John James (14th-century MP), MP for Melcombe Regis", "* John James (died 1601), MP for St Ives and Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* John James (Parliamentarian) (died 1681), English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1653 for Worcestershire", "* John James (died 1718), MP for Brackley", "* John James (Wisconsin politician) fl. 1850s member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "* Sir John James, 1st Baronet (1784\u20131869), Dublin wine merchant and Lord Mayor of Dublin", "* John James (Canadian politician) (1911\u20131999), Canadian Member of Parliament", "* John James (Archdeacon of the Seychelles)", "* John James (priest) (died 1938), Archdeacon of Llandaff", "* John James (American football) (born 1949), former American professional football player and punter", "* John James (Australian rules footballer) (1934\u20132010), leading Australian rules footballer in the Victorian Football League (VFL)", "* John James (footballer, born 1934) (born 1934), English football inside forward for Birmingham and Torquay", "* John James (footballer, born 1948) (1948\u20132021), English football striker for Port Vale, Chester, Tranmere and Chicago Sting", "* John James (racing driver) (1914\u20132002), British racing driver", "* John James (rower) (born 1937), British rower and Olympic medallist", "* John James (tennis) (born 1951), Australian tennis player", "* John James (architect) (c. 1670\u20131746), English architect", "* John James (Australian architect) (born 1931), British-born Australian architect and historian", "* John James (pirate) (fl. 1699\u20131700), pirate active off the American east coast and Madagascar", "* John James (Manager of Barbuda) (1774\u20131826), resident manager of Barbuda in the early 19th century", "* John James (Medal of Honor) (1838\u20131902), American soldier in the Indian Wars"]}, {"page": "Duck Baker", "response": ["* John James, Descriptive Guitar Instrumentals (Kicking Mule, 1976)"]}, {"page": "List of Peel sessions", "response": ["* John James: (1 session, 1968)"]}, {"page": "Fairport's Cropredy Convention appearances", "response": ["*John James Band with Dick Heckstall-Smith"]}, {"page": "Al Jones (English musician)", "response": ["He first came to prominence in the Bristol folk scene in the mid-1960s, where he formed a trio with harmonica player Elliot Jackson and singer/guitarist Ian A.

He moved to London in 1968/1969 and featured on \"Matchbox Days\", an early Village Thing compilation of tracks by the white British \"Blues Boom\" artists of that period, alongside Jo-Ann Kelly, John James, Mike Cooper and Dave Kelly. He made an album before moving to Cornwall, where he became reclusive. Anderson persuaded him to make a further album in 1972, \"Jonesville\", which featured a very early Rodney Matthews cover.
