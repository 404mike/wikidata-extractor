As an entertainer, his appearance was large and lumbering at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), and he habitually wore a red fez when performing. He initially served in the British Army for seven years, before eventually developing his conjuring skills and becoming a member of The Magic Circle. Although he spent time on tour performing his magical act, which specialised on magic tricks that appeared to \"fail\", he rose to international prominence when his career moved into television, with programmes for London Weekend Television and Thames Television.\nBy the end of the 1970s, Cooper was smoking and drinking heavily, which affected his career and his health, effectively ending offers to front new programmes and relegating him to performing as a guest star on other entertainment shows. On 15 April 1984, Cooper died of a heart attack live on television.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 15", "response": ["*1984 \u2013 Tommy Cooper, Welsh comedian and magician (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "Alan Ayckbourn", "response": ["His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with Mr. Whatnot, again premiering at the Victoria Theatre.
