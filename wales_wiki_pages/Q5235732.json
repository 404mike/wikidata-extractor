He was born in Rhymney, Glamorgan and although his nickname was Roxy the media got it wrong and he would often be referred to as Rocky or  David Rocky Jones. \nHis best tournament display came in the Winmau World Masters when he reached the final in 1975 before losing to fellow countryman Alan Evans. Also during 1975 he won the Marlborough Masters and took the Unicorn World Pairs championships with Ray Phillips. He also had success in international darts with his country Wales, when they took the WDF World Cup team title in 1977.\nHe also appeared on television in the last darts final of Yorkshire Television's Indoor League in 1977, finishing runner-up to Tony Brown.\nThe World Professional Darts Championship was first organised in 1978, but despite his relative success around that time Jones never featured in the event.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Jones", "response": ["David Jones may refer to:", "* David Jones (jazz musician) (1888\u20131956), American jazz saxophonist", "* David Jones (drummer), Australian drummer", "* David Jones (director) (1934\u20132008), English stage, television and film director", "* David Jones (presenter), English sports broadcaster on Sky Sports since 1999", "* David Jones (artist-poet) (1895\u20131974), British modernist poet, writer, and artist", "* David Jones (programmer) (active in 1980s), former freelance computer game programmer", "* David Jones (video game developer) (born 1966), Scottish video game programmer and entrepreneur", "* David Jones (writer), creator of the television series Fireman Sam", "* David Jones (merchant) (1793\u20131873), Welsh-Australian department store founder", "* David Jones (advertising executive) (born 1966), English born businessman", "* David Jones (VC) (1892\u20131916), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* David Jones (Upper Canada politician) (1792\u20131870), lawyer, judge and political figure", "* David Jones (Carmarthenshire MP) (1810\u20131869), Welsh banker and Conservative Party politician", "* David Jones (Clwyd West MP) (born 1952), Conservative Party MP, former AM and Welsh Secretary", "* David Jones (New Zealand politician) (1873\u20131941), New Zealand politician", "* David Jones (Guernsey politician) (1949\u20132016), Minister of Housing in Guernsey, Channel Islands", "* David Jones (Llangan) (1736\u20131810), Welsh Church of England priest who was supportive of Methodism", "* David Jones (missionary) (1796\u20131841), Welsh missionary in Madagascar", "* David Jones (Dean of Llandaff) (1870\u20131949), Dean of Llandaff Cathedral", "* David Jones (archdeacon of Carmarthen) (1874\u20131950), Archdeacon of Carmarthen", "* David Jones (philosopher) (born 1950), American professor of philosophy ", "* David Jones (Browns owner), majority owner of the Cleveland Browns from 1953 to 1961", "* David Jones (Cardinals owner) (1883\u20131966), American football team owner for the Chicago Cardinals", "* David Jones (cornerback) (born 1985), American football player", "* David Jones (offensive lineman) (born 1961), American football player for the Washington Redskins", "* David Jones (safety) (born 1993), American football player;
