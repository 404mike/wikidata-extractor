He was born in Rhymney, Glamorgan and although his nickname was Roxy the media got it wrong and he would often be referred to as Rocky or  David Rocky Jones. \nHis best tournament display came in the Winmau World Masters when he reached the final in 1975 before losing to fellow countryman Alan Evans. Also during 1975 he won the Marlborough Masters and took the Unicorn World Pairs championships with Ray Phillips. He also had success in international darts with his country Wales, when they took the WDF World Cup team title in 1977.\nHe also appeared on television in the last darts final of Yorkshire Television's Indoor League in 1977, finishing runner-up to Tony Brown.\nThe World Professional Darts Championship was first organised in 1978, but despite his relative success around that time Jones never featured in the event.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
