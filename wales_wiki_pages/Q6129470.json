In his three years at the Ospreys, Bater made a total of 67 appearances, scoring six tries. However, due to the rise of future Wales captain Ryan Jones and the signings of Filo Tiatia and Jono Gibbes, Bater found himself on the fringes of the first team at the Ospreys. The Scarlets came in with a bid for him, and he was allowed to leave. Bater has managed to make a place for himself in the Scarlets side, and has even captained the team when regular captain, Simon Easterby, and vice-captain, Stephen Jones, are on international duty.\nIn March 2009 it was announced that Bater had been forced to retire due to a neck injury and hoped to return to dentistry. Bater resumed his career in dentistry and now works for a dental practice in Skewen, Wales.He attained his only international cap as a replacement against Romania on 27 August 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["* James Bater: (2003)"]}, {"page": "Pencoed RFC", "response": ["*James Bater"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Llanelli Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FL||align=\"left\"| James Bater"]}, {"page": "Brynteg School", "response": ["* James Bater, (Llanelli Scarlets), Wales, 1 cap 2003"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FL||align=\"left\"| James Bater", "|  James Bater"]}, {"page": "2003 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches", "response": ["Wales: Gavin Henson, 14.
