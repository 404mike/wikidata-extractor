He presided over eleven World Snooker Championship finals, nine at the Crucible Theatre, including the 1985 final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis \u2013 the most watched snooker match in history. Having began refereeing in the 1960s, Williams left the civil service in 1981 to go full-time. Having the chance to referee tournaments at Pontins, he took charge quickly and organised the events for many years. Williams gained national attention following a match between Fred Davis and Alex Higgins where the roof collapsed after rainfall and flooded the snooker table. He was pictured in many national newspapers after the event and resulted in more television coverage.\nThe longstanding referee for snooker television show Pot Black, he took charge after Sydney Lee's retirement at the 1981 event. Williams was forced into retirement in 2002 due to contract negotiations with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, but made sporadic appearances at the World Seniors Championship until 2012.", "link_mentions": {}}}
