In 1945, he was one of three Welshmen, all from the Llanelli area, who had trials with the Halifax rugby league club (Heritage \u2116 546). A wing, he made a relatively slow start to his rugby league career, which was interrupted with a period in the armed forces. Following a big improvement in his form in 1948\u201349, he was by 1949 an important part of the Halifax side.\nIn 1950, he toured Australasia with the Great Britain squad, but injury forced him to return home early before the first test. He made 13 appearances for Wales, scoring nine tries.He was Halifax captain for the 1952/53 season. However, injuries would curtail his season. A splintered ankle bone sustained in the Second Test playing for Great Britain against the touring Australians at Swinton kept him out of the third. A broken arm in a home match against Huddersfield on Christmas Day 1952 ended his season.\nHis domestic career also included two Challenge Cup Final appearances at Wembley. The first was in 1954 when Halifax drew with Warrington, the tie was settled in the famous Odsal replay where he had a try disallowed in a defeat for Halifax. His next Wembley appearance came in 1956 against St. Helens where once again, Halifax were the losing side.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
