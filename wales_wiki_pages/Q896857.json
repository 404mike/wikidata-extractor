Spending his entire career at the University of Oxford, he wrote the most commonly cited edition of Seneca the Younger's Letters.Born in South Wales into a family of English heritage, he studied Latin at University College Cardiff and Classics at St. John's College, Cambridge. From 1957 to his retirement in 1996, Reynolds was a fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and lectured in Latin literature at the University of Oxford. Since 1987, he was a fellow of the British Academy.\nThe central academic achievement of Reynolds's career was the publication in 1965 of The Medieval Tradition of Seneca's Letters, in which he reconstructed how the text was transmitted through the Middle Ages and revealed that most of the younger manuscripts were of little use for the establishment of the text. In the same year, he published an edition of the Letters based on his conclusions. He also wrote critical editions of Seneca's Dialogues, the works of the historian Sallust, and Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum. In 1968, Reynolds and his Oxford colleague Nigel Guy Wilson co-authored Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature, a well-received introduction to textual criticism.\nReynolds's reputation was largely based on his contributions to textual criticism. Writing about the set of critical editions authored by Reynolds, the Latinist Michael Reeve stated that Reynolds's scholarship had the ability to \"to cut through dozens of manuscripts to the serviceable core\". At the time of its publication, his work on Seneca was considered by some commentators to be difficult to surpass, and his edition of the Letters still serves as the standard text as of 2001. \n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
