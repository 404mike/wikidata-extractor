The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like David Tress or the more traditional approaches used by others like Rob Piercy."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"D\"", "response": ["*Ivor Davies (born 1935), Welsh painter and mosaic artist"]}, {"page": "Ivor Davies MBE", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ivor Davies (artist)"]}, {"page": "Ivor Davies (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ivor Davies (1915\u20131986) was a British Liberal Party member and parliamentary candidate..", "Ivor Davies may also refer to:", "* Ivor Davies (artist) (born 1935), Welsh artist", "* Ivor Davies (priest) (1917\u20131992), British priest and Archdeacon of Lewisham", "* Ivor Davies (rugby, born 1906) (1906\u20131963), Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s", "* Ivor Davies (rugby union, born 1892) (1892\u20131959), Welsh international rugby union player"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh artists", "response": ["*Ivor Davies (born 1935), painter, mixed media, installation and mosaic artist"]}, {"page": "The Welsh Group", "response": ["* Ivor Davies"]}, {"page": "David Garner (artist)", "response": ["Welsh artist Ivor Davies has described Garner as \"one of the few, one of the most important artists in Britain\".
