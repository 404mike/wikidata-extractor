He was the first British Jew to win an Olympic gold medal.He was born in Cardiff, to John Jacobs (previously Yaakov), who was a general dealer from London. His athletics career started in London with Herne Hill Harriers in 1908. His interest in athletics was aroused by watching the 1908 Olympic Games.\nAt the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Jacobs won a gold medal as the first leg in the British 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team, in spite of finishing second behind the United States in the semifinals. The United States was later disqualified for a fault in passing the baton, the same mistake made in the finals by the world record holder and main favourite German team.\nJacobs also competed in the 100m and 200m individual events, but was eliminated in the semifinals.Although many times a Welsh champion, Jacobs never succeeded in winning a AAA title. He retired from active sport after World War I.He died suddenly in Aberconwy, aged 88, while on holiday from his London home. His body was returned to London, where he was buried in a Jewish cemetery, at East Ham. At the time of his death he was Britain's oldest Olympic gold medalist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1976", "response": ["** David Jacobs, Welsh Olympic athlete (b. 1888)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*David Jacobs (1888\u20131976), gold medallist at the 1912 Summer Olympics"]}, {"page": "Harold Abrahams", "response": ["* David Jacobs, the first British Jew to win an Olympic Gold Medal"]}, {"page": "Eric Liddell", "response": ["* David Jacobs, the first British Jew to win an Olympic Gold Medal"]}]}}
