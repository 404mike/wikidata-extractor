Similarly, he became visibly angry with Peter Ebdon during their second round match in the 2003 World Championship, in which Ebdon repeatedly left the arena between frames. Drago took this as an attempt to disrupt the flow of his game, but apologised publicly when he later found out that Ebdon had been ill during the match."]}, {"page": "List of snooker players", "response": ["*Mark Bennett"]}, {"page": "World Open (snooker)", "response": ["These facts made it more common to see surprise results than in most other tournaments, with players such as Dominic Dale, Marco Fu, Euan Henderson and Dave Harold all surprise finalists at the time.

Few of those have become consistent stars, although Stephen Hendry and John Higgins took their first ranking titles in the event.
