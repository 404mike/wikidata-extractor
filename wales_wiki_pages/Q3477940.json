He gave his name to the later kingdom of Seisyllwg, which consisted of Ceredigion plus the region known as Ystrad Tywi; as such he was possibly the king responsible for the expansion.

The name Seisyllwg appears in some later sources, such as the Book of Llandaff, the Welsh Triads, and the Welsh laws, the latter of which describes it as one of the three principal subdivisions of South Wales, along with Morgannwg and Reinwg (probably Dyfed).Jones, pp. 61\u201362.

Around the year 730  Seisyll ap Clydog, king of Ceredigion, captured Ystrad Tywi from Rhain ap Cadwgan, king of Dyfed, and annexed it to his own kingdom.
