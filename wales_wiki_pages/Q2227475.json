In London he was mobbed by an enthusiastic crowd and on 16 January at Queen Victoria's invitation he was received at Windsor to explain to her and Prince Albert the details of the battle. Victoria noted how \"modestly\" he presented his story, but this reticence was absent in his public appearances: on 5 February, he gave a highly exaggerated account of his participation in the charge at a banquet held in his honour at the Mansion House, London.Calthorpe (1856) p.148 \"\u2026the wonderful way in which Lord Cardigan indulges his imagination\". On 8 February, at a speech in his home town of Northampton, he went even further, describing how he had shared the privations of his men by living the \"whole time in a common tent\" and how, after the charge, he had rallied his troops and pursued the fleeing enemy artillerymen as far as the Tchernaya river. As his biographer Saul David points out, \"a more misleading account of his own exploits could hardly have been given\".", "In her sweeping condemnation of the Victorian class system, The Reason Why (1953), Cecil Woodham-Smith used the Earl as a prism on the ills of British society of the time (but conceded that in the Charge itself Cardigan conducted himself with unwavering courage and discipline). Donald Thomas's 1974 biography Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava provided a more sympathetic portrayal. Saul David's 1997 hostile assessment, on the other hand, was entitled simply The Homicidal Earl. Terry Brighton's 2005 book Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade provides a more recent critical account of Cardigan as a brigade commander but finds him in no way to blame for the charge."]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Saul David (born 1966) \u2013 Military history"]}, {"page": "Battle of Isandlwana", "response": ["* Zulu: The True Story By Dr. Saul David"]}, {"page": "Time Commanders", "response": ["During each game, a pair of military specialists analysed the performance of the players and explained how the real historical battle unfolded.
