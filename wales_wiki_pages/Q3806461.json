He was made heir to his uncle Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley. He was married four times. His third wife was Lady Isabel, daughter of Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk; and his fourth wife was the Lady Joan Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. Lord Berkeley was involved in a bitter feud with his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the fifth Baron Berkeley and wife of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. He was unable initially to claim Berkeley Castle, as it was taken in possession by the Earl and Countess of Warwick. In 1421, when the Warwicks finally gave up Berkeley Castle, James was summoned to Parliament by writ as Lord Berkeley. The feud did not end there as his third wife Isabel was captured by the Countess of Warwick's son-in-law the Earl of Shrewsbury, and held imprisoned until her death in 1452.\nLord Berkeley was succeeded by his son from his third marriage, William, who was created Marquess of Berkeley in 1489.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk", "response": ["*Lady Isabel de Mowbray; married firstly Sir Henry Ferrers, son of William 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby, and secondly James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley."]}, {"page": "John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury", "response": ["*Lady Joan Talbot (c. 1422), married James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Fitzalan, Duchess of Norfolk", "response": ["**Isabel de Mowbray (b.1396),UK and Ireland, Find a Grave Index, 1300s-Current married James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley"]}, {"page": "Baron Berkeley", "response": ["*James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (c. 1394\u20131463), James the Just, nephew and heir male.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, II, p.132"]}, {"page": "Steep Holm", "response": ["However, in the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed.
