Several claims have been made for Amerike by popular writers of the late twentieth century. One was that he was the major funder of the voyage of exploration launched from Bristol by the Venetian John Cabot in 1497, and that Amerike was the owner of Cabot's ship, the Matthew.  The other claim revived a theory first proposed in 1908 by a Bristolian scholar and amateur historian, Alfred Hudd. Hudd's theory, greatly elaborated by  later writers, suggested that the continental name America was derived from Amerike's surname in gratitude for his sponsorship of Cabot's successful discovery expedition to the 'New World'.  However, neither claim is backed up by hard evidence, and the consensus view is that America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Waldseem\u00fcller", "response": ["* Richard Amerike"]}, {"page": "1503", "response": ["** Richard Amerike, English merchant and patron of John Cabot (b. 1445)"]}, {"page": "1497", "response": ["* May 20 \u2013 John Cabot sets sail from Bristol, on the ship Matthew (principally owned by Richard Amerike), looking for new lands to the west (some sources give a May 2 date)."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Richard ap Meryk (or ap Meurig), Anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) (c. 1445\u20131503), after whom America is reputed to be named"]}, {"page": "Naming of the Americas", "response": ["The naming of the Americas, or America, occurred shortly after Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas in 1492.

Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) ( 1445\u20131503) was a wealthy Anglo-Welsh merchant, royal customs officer and sheriff of Bristol. According to some historians, he was the principal owner of the Matthew, the ship sailed by John Cabot during his voyage of exploration to North America in 1497. The idea that Richard Amerike was a 'principal supporter' of Cabot has gained popular currency in the 21st century. There is no known evidence to support this. Similarly, and contrary to a recent tradition that names Amerike as principal owner and main funder of the Matthew, Cabot's ship of 1497, academic enquiry does not connect Amerike with the ship.
