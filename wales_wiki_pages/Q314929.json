He came to further prominence in 1956 as jockey to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, riding her horse Devon Loch which fell when close to winning the Grand National. Francis retired from the turf and became a journalist and novelist.\nMany of his novels deal with crime in the horse-racing world, with some of the criminals being outwardly respectable figures. The stories are narrated by the main character, often a jockey, but sometimes a trainer, an owner, a bookie, or someone in a different profession, peripherally linked to racing. This person always faces great obstacles, often including physical injury. More than forty of these novels became international best-sellers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 14", "response": ["*  2010   \u2013 Dick Francis, Welsh jockey and author (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "October 31", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Dick Francis, Welsh-Caymanian jockey and author (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "1920", "response": ["** Dick Francis, British jockey-turned-novelist (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "2010", "response": ["* February 14 \u2013 Dick Francis, British author and jockey (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother", "response": ["Elizabeth oversaw the restoration of the remote Castle of Mey, on the north coast of Scotland, which she used to \"get away from everything\"Vickers, p. 314 for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.

Devon Loch, owned by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, had cleared the final fence in the leading position, five lengths clear of E.S.B. Forty yards from what seemed like certain victory, Devon Loch suddenly, and inexplicably, half-jumped into the air and collapsed in a belly-flop on the turf. Despite efforts by jockey Dick Francis, Devon Loch was unable to complete the race, leaving E.S.B. to cross the finishing line first. Responding to the commiserations of E.S.B.\u2019s owner, the Queen Mother famously commented: \"Oh, that's racing!\"", "Many other well-known jockeys have failed to win the Grand National. These include champion jockeys such as Terry Biddlecombe, John Francome, Josh Gifford, Stan Mellor, Jonjo O'Neill (who never finished the race) and Fred Rimell. Three jockeys who led over the last fence in the National but lost the race on the run-in ended up as television commentators: Lord Oaksey (on Carrickbeg in 1963), Norman Williamson (on Mely Moss in 2000), and Richard Pitman (on Crisp in 1973). Dick Francis also never won the Grand National in 8 attempts although he did lead over the last fence on Devon Loch in the 1956 race, only for the horse to collapse under him when well in front only 40 yards from the winning post. Pitman's son Mark also led over the last fence, only to be pipped at the post when riding Garrison Savannah in 1991. David Dick won the 1956 Grand National on E.S.B. when Devon Loch collapsed and he also holds the record for the number of clear rounds \u2013 nine times.
