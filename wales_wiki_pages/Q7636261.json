He died about 1090/1.\nSulien is closely associated with the clas church at Llanbadarn Fawr near Aberystwyth where it appears that he took refuge when St David's was at times exposed to Viking incursions. Llanbadarn enjoyed a reputation for scholarship. One of his sons, Rhigyfarch was the author of a 'Life of Saint David'.", "link_mentions": {}}}
