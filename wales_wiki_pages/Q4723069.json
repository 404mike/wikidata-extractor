By the time he was twenty-six he had risen to be manager of the business. Not finding sufficient scope in this post, he borrowed money to purchase two or three small sailing vessels, and started in the shipping business on his own account. The venture succeeded, and he made additions to his fleet, but after a few years' successful trading, realizing that sailing ships were about to be superseded by steamers, he sold his vessels.About this time (1891) Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., who purchased the business of the old African Steamship Company, offered him a managerial post. This offer he accepted, subject to Messrs. Elder, Dempster selling him a number of their shares, and he thus acquired an interest in the business, and subsequently, by further share purchases, its control. took a keen interest in imperial affairs. He acquired considerable territorial interests in West Africa, and financial interests in many of the companies engaged in opening up and developing that part of the world.Elder Dempster employed both E.D. Morel and Roger Casement who in time became bitter enemies of Jones.\n\nIn the early 1900s Alfred Jones had a monopoly on the Congo-Antwerp mail traffic as well as consular duties representing King Leopold's Congo State in Liverpool. Described by W.T. Stead as the \"Uncrowned King of West Africa\", Jones had myriad interests. In 1900, in order to supply his ships with bunker fuel, he formed Elder's Navigation Collieries Ltd. and bought the Oakwood and Garth Merthyr colleries near Maesteg in the Llynfi valley, south Wales. He took the leading part in opening up a new line of communication with the West Indies, and in stimulating the Jamaica fruit trade and tourist traffic. He also developed the tourist trade in the Canary Islands and the banana industry there. Jones was instrumental in founding the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and was chairman of the Bank of British West Africa. He was President of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce.\nHe had been interested in cotton growing in West Africa and had even distributed cotton seed there. As a result, in 1902, he was approached, and became, inaugural President of the British Cotton Growing Association.Jones was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1901 Birthday Honours list on 9 November 1901, in recognition of services to the West African Colonies, and to Jamaica, and invested as such by King Edward VII at St James's Palace on 17 December 1901.\nIn May 1902 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford.Sir Alfred died unmarried on 13 December 1909, leaving large charitable bequests.\nA main street in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool", "response": ["Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.

But, the Jephson family's historian provides no evidence of this.Maurice Denham Jephson, An Anglo-Irish Miscellany, Allen Figgis, Dublin, 1964. The family lived in England in genteel poverty; Roger's mother died when he was nine. His father took the family back to Ireland to County Antrim to live near paternal relatives. When Casement was 13 years old, his father died in Ballymena, and he was left dependent on the charity of relatives, the Youngs and the Casements. He was educated at the Diocesan School, Ballymena (later the Ballymena Academy). He left school at 16 and went to England to work as a clerk with Elder Dempster, a Liverpool shipping company headed by Alfred Lewis Jones.S\u00e9amas \u00d3 S\u00edoch\u00e1in, Roger Casement, Imperialist, Rebel, Revolutionary, Lilliput Press, 2008, p. 15; ", "Leopold had exploited the territory's natural resources (mostly rubber) as a private entrepreneur, not as king of the Belgians.

At the time, Liverpool was a prominent port city which carried on an extensive trade with overseas regions such as West and Southern Africa.  Consequently, the number of patients in the region admitted to hospital with 'tropical' diseases soared. Recognising the need for a solution to this problem Jones, together with a number of fellow business men and health pioneers, pledged an annual donation of \u00a3350 for three years to promote the study of tropical diseases in the city. This offer of financial support was announced at the annual dinner of students of Liverpool's Royal Southern Hospital and was warmly accepted by the hospital's president who later went on to suggest that his hospital should act as the clinical focus of the studies in view of its proximity to the docks.", "When Alfred Lewis Jones died in 1909 he left a large bequest to the school. Thanks to this and other donations that it received the school was able to set up its own laboratory and teaching premises in Pembroke Place, separate from the University of Liverpool, upon whose facilities it had previously relied. The laboratory was completed in 1914 but due to the advent of the war occupation of the building by LTSM was deferred and it was used as a Tropical Diseases Hospital offering courses to officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Professor R M Gordon joined the school in 1919 and by 1920 teaching had resumed and the school finally moved into its own building."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Alfred Lewis Jones: Ship owner, and founder of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine."]}, {"page": "Victoria Memorial, London", "response": ["Funding for the memorial was gathered from around the British Empire as well as the public.
