Roberts's family moved to Liverpool in England while he was an infant, but despite this he retained a strong link to his country of birth and was a fluent Welsh speaker. He wrote for several Welsh journals and travelled Wales, setting up music classes. He is most notable for pioneering the tonic sol-fa method of sight-singing in Wales, which in turn led to the strengthening of the practice of congregational singing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Wales", "response": ["Welsh traditional music declined with the rise of Nonconformist religion in the 18th century, which emphasized choral singing over instruments, and religious over secular uses of music; traditional musical styles became associated with drunkenness and immorality.

The hymns were popularised by writers such as William Williams, while others were set to popular secular tunes or adopted Welsh ballad tunes. The appointment of Henry Mills as a musical overseer to the Welsh Methodist congregations in the 1780s saw a drive to improve singing throughout Wales. This saw the formation of local musical societies and in the first half of the 19th century Musical primers and collections of tunes were printed and distributed. Congregational singing was given further impetus with the arrival of the temperance movement, which saw the Temperance Choral Union (formed in 1854) organising annual singing festivals, these included hymn singing by combined choirs. The publication of Llyfr Tonau Cynulleidfaol by John Roberts in 1859 provided congregations with a body of standard tunes that were less complex with unadorned harmonies. This collection began the practice of combining together to sing tunes from the book laid the foundation for the Cymanfa Ganu (the hymn singing festival).Davies (2008), pg 768. Around the same period, the growing availability of music in the tonic sol-fa notation, promoted by the likes of Eleazar Roberts, allowed congregations to read music more fluently. One particularly popular hymn of this period was \"Llef\"."]}, {"page": "1912 in Wales", "response": ["*6 April \u2013 Eleazar Roberts, writer and musician, 87"]}, {"page": "1893 in Wales", "response": ["*Eleazar Roberts \u2013 Owen Rees"]}, {"page": "1825 in Wales", "response": ["*15 January \u2013 Eleazar Roberts, writer and musician (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Roberts", "response": ["*Eleazar Roberts, Welsh musician and translator"]}, {"page": "Eleazer Roberts", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleazar Roberts"]}]}}
