Both children were played by adults, the former appearing dressed in school uniform. The father, \"Will\", was the silent type, but each week, Nigel Wyn would address him as \"Will\" and \"Will\" would say, \"Don't call Will on your father\". (The phrase \"call on\" is a direct translation from the Welsh \"Paid a galw Wil ar dy dad!\"). With its almost surreal humour, \"Our House\" has achieved an iconic status. On one occasion, the show's guest star Ken Dodd also appeared as a character in \"Our House\"."]}, {"page": "Live at Treorchy", "response": ["*Derek Boote: bass"]}]}}
