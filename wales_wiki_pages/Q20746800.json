While there he began his public singing career, performing in oratorios and other concerts. Moving back to Wales at the end of the war, he continued to pursue singing opportunities. Having taken singing lessons while in London, he now enrolled at the Cardiff College of Music (now the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama) and, towards the end of 1947, successfully auditioned for the original BBC Welsh Chorus, founded by the BBC's Director of Music in Wales, Idris Lewis. The new Chorus, conducted by Arwel Hughes, was established to complement the BBC Welsh Orchestra which was reformed after the war, in 1946, at the instigation of Sir Adrian Boult. Both were cornerstones of the BBC's renewed commitment in the post-war years to the encouragement and promotion of sung excellence through its broadcasts to Wales and the UK.Rowland Lucas, The Voice of  Nation: A Concise Account of the BBC in Wales 1923-1973 (Llandysul: Gomer; 1981)", "His radio work during the 1950s included appearances as a soloist with popular singing groups of the time such as the Garth Players and he was, for a time, a member of the Lyrian Singers. He performed live broadcast recitals of light songs and favourite numbers from the shows, together with work by contemporary Welsh composers such as Mansel Thomas and Idris Lewis himself. His lyric style singled him out as a favoured soloist for specialised music programmes. In July 1953, for example, he sang in a tribute to a well-loved songwriter: Edward German \u2013 A Man and his Music was broadcast both on the BBC Welsh Home Service and on the General Overseas Service of the BBC.
