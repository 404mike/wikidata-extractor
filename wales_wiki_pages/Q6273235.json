Famously the stunt went wrong when he failed to pick the lock and was seen kicking his legs before passing out and being dropped, unconscious, into cardboard boxes at which point the show went to intermission. Producers later explained that the stunt had pre-arranged safety measures, meaning Jonathan's life was never in danger."]}, {"page": "Barry and Stuart", "response": ["Dirty Tricks is a six-part series that was hosted by Jones and MacLeod.
