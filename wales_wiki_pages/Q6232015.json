Evans joined Newport after showing promise as a Welsh Schools players, winning three caps while at Newport High School. Evans captained Newport on two occasions, once in 1935/36 season and again in 1936/37. In 1935 Evans captained Newport against the touring New Zealand team.\nEvans made his one and only international appearance against England in the 1934 Home Nations Championship, and was given the captaincy. He was one of 13 new caps to play for Wales, with only Claude Davey and Dai Thomas with any past international experience. Wales came a poor second, losing 9-0. The selectors were severely criticized for their choice, not only because of the teams inexperience, but also because seven of the team played their rugby outside Wales. Evans was one of five players from the Welsh team that day that became one cap wonders.\nEvans was killed in action while serving his country in North Africa during the Second World War. Whilst serving in 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, Evans parachuted into French Tunisia in November 1942 and was fatally shot by a sniper while defending Sedjenane crossroads in March 1943.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Evans", "response": ["John Evans may refer to:", "* John Evans (archaeologist) (1823\u20131908), English archaeologist and geologist", "* John Evans (topographical writer) (1768\u2013c. 1812), writer on Wales", "* John Evans (actor) (1693\u20131734), Irish", "* John Evans (19th-century writer) (died 1832), English writer", "* John Evans (artist) (1932\u20132012), American", "* John Evans (director), American film director and screenwriter", "* John Evans (special effects), on five James Bond films", "* John Evans or I.
