He suffered a concussion that kept him out of the game against Zebre on 1 November, but returned to the starting line-up for the Scarlets' two Anglo-Welsh Cup matches that month, before dropping to the bench for the Pro12 game against Glasgow on 21 November, and only after Regan King had been injured in the pre-match warm-up. He was on the bench again for the first two games of 2015, and was forced into an extended cameo in the second match against Glasgow after Liam Williams suffered a shoulder injury early in the second half, and started in place of Williams in the next match away to Leicester Tigers in the Champions Cup the following week. Full-back duties were assigned to Steven Shingler, Josh Lewis and Kristian Phillips for the next three games, but Williams started the next five during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the first of those in a 32\u201314 home win over Connacht on 15 February after making an interception on his own goal line, and another in a 23\u201313 win at home to Leinster on 7 March. A shoulder injury that required surgery brought an early end to Williams' season. During the season, Williams also played three times for Carmarthen Quins in the British and Irish Cup, scoring one try against Jersey Reds.", "Despite finding success in the RFU Championship, in November 2017, Williams agreed to return to Wales with the Dragons for the 2018\u201319 season after the expiry of his contract with Bristol in order to make himself eligible to play for Wales again. He was ever-present for the Dragons during the 2018\u201319 season, playing 26 times and scoring four tries, a conversion and two penalties. He made his debut on 1 September 2018, in a 21\u201317 home defeat to Benetton Treviso, and scored his first try two weeks later, a 60-metre solo score in a 52\u201310 away defeat to Leinster. His kicking abilities were in evidence the following week, when he landed a long-range effort in a 16\u20135 home win over Zebre, followed by another penalty and a conversion, as well as setting up the opening try for Josh Lewis, in a 23\u201315 home loss to the Cardiff Blues. Despite continuing to provide opportunities for his teammates, his next score did not come for another 12 matches, as he scored the seventh of the Dragons' nine tries in a 59\u20133 win at home to Timi\u0219oara Saracens in the European Challenge Cup on 11 January 2019. He scored again after coming off the bench in the team's very next match, at home to Clermont, but it proved to be only a consolation try, as the French side won 49\u20137 to eliminate the Dragons from the Challenge Cup. His final score of the season came on 4 April, when he came off the bench to help the Dragons come from behind to salvage an 18\u201318 draw away to the Southern Kings."]}, {"page": "Josh Lewis", "response": ["*Josh Lewis (rugby league) (born 1985), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Josh Lewis (guitarist) (born 1967), guitarist with Warrant ", "*Josh Lewis (Emmerdale), a character on the British soap opera Emmerdale", "*Josh Lewis (rugby union) (born 1992),  Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Scarlets season", "response": ["| Josh Lewis", "|align=\"left\"|FH||align=\"left\"| Josh Lewis"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FH||align=\"left\"| Josh Lewis"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 British and Irish Cup", "response": ["| 7 ||  Josh Lewis || Scarlets Premiership Select || 6 || 36"]}, {"page": "List of 2016\u201317 Pro12 transfers", "response": ["* Josh Lewis to  Ebbw Vale"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Scarlets season", "response": ["| Josh Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of 2017\u201318 Premiership Rugby transfers", "response": ["* Josh Lewis from  Ebbw Vale"]}, {"page": "List of 2018\u201319 Pro14 transfers", "response": ["* Josh Lewis from  Bath"]}, {"page": "List of 2018\u201319 Premiership Rugby transfers", "response": ["* Josh Lewis to  Dragons"]}]}}
