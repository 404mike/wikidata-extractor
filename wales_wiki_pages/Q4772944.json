He was born at Skewen, Glamorgan and died at Eastbourne, Sussex.\nLing was a left-handed middle or lower-order batsman. He was educated at Stowe School and played Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire from 1928. In 1934, he was given a trial of eight matches for Glamorgan which was looking for Welsh-born cricketers: an average of 23 runs per innings indicates that he was quite successful, but his highest score was only 41, an unbeaten innings in the match against Leicestershire at Swansea. Though he played other matches for Glamorgan's second eleven, he made only one further first-class appearance in a single match in 1936.\nIn July 1939, having moved to the West of England for business, Ling played in five consecutive matches for Somerset, but without success.\nIn his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was misnamed as \"Arthur\" Ling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Anthony Ling (1939) 5 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Tony Ling", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anthony Ling"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Anthony Ling (1934\u20131936) : A.
