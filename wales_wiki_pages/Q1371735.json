While in Dublin, Love met musician Julian Cope of the Teardrop Explodes at one of the band's concerts. Cope took a liking to Love and offered to let her stay at his Liverpool home in his absence. She traveled to London, where she was met by her friend and future bandmate, Robin Barbur, from Portland. Recalling Cope's offer, Love and Barbur moved into Cope's home with him and several other artists, including Pete de Freitas of Echo & the Bunnymen. De Freitas was initially hesitant to allow the girls to stay, but acquiesced as they were \"alarmingly young and obviously had nowhere else to go\". Love recalled: \"They kind of took me in. I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsals.\" Cope writes of Love frequently in his 1994 autobiography, Head-On, in which he refers to her as \"the adolescent\"."]}, {"page": "Craig Charles", "response": ["Charles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British cabaret circuit.

Musicologist Julian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says \"Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon\", based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew. For instance, while one of the main groups originally tagged as Krautrock, Faust, recorded a seminal 12-minute track they titled \"Krautrock\", they would later distance themselves from the term, saying: \"When the English people started talking about Krautrock, we thought they were just taking the piss... and when you hear the so-called 'Krautrock renaissance', it makes me think everything we did was for nothing.\"", "Krautrock has proved to be highly influential on a succession of other musical styles and developments. Early contemporary enthusiasts outside Germany included Hawkwind and in particular Dave Brock who supposedly penned the sleeve notes for the British edition of Neu!'s first album Faust's budget release The Faust Tapes has been cited as a formative teenage influence by several musicians growing up in the early 1970s such as Julian Cope (who has always cited Krautrock as an influence, and wrote the book Krautrocksampler on the subject). The genre also had a strong influence on David Bowie's Station to Station (1976) and the experimentation it inspired led to his 'Berlin Trilogy'.Buckley (2000): pp. 275\u2013277.Pegg (2004): pp. 205\u2013206."]}, {"page": "The Shangri-Las", "response": ["The line from \"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\" \u2013 \"When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V\" \u2013 was used by the New York Dolls on their 1973 recording \"Looking for a Kiss\".
