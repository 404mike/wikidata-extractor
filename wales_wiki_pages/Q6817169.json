It was reprinted by Honno, the Welsh Women's Press, in 2003, with an introduction by Angela John. It was dramatised by BBC Radio 4 in 2012. by Diana Griffiths.\nMan's Desiring (1960) was described by a reviewer as a novel with \"warm and winning ways\" a gentle comedy of contrasts about a Welsh man and an English woman at a Midlands university.The Small Mine tells the tale of a young collier's death in an industrial accident in the same fictional village created in Strike for a Kingdom. It was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 2004 by Diana Griffiths.\nTravels with a Duchess is the journey of a menopausal wife from Cardiff who loses her luggage en route to Yugoslavia and abandons her usual ways in favor of adventure and 'debauchery'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ystradgynlais", "response": ["The Polish painter Josef Herman (1911\u20132000), spent 11 years living and painting in Ystradgynlais.

Lewis Jones (1897\u20131939), and Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999), and poet Idris Davies (1905\u201353). Jack Jones was a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897\u20131939) largely autobiographical novel. Gwyn Thomas (1913\u201381) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905\u201353), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh \"but rebellion against chapel religion\", along with the \"inspirational influence of English\" poets, led him to write in English. Gwalia Deserta (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of The Angry Summer (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. Rhys Davies, author of A Time To Laugh (1937), and Menna Gallie, author of Strike for a Kingdom (1959) and The Small Mine (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of South Wales. Harold Heslop, author of the novel The Earth Beneath (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of England, as was Sid Chaplin, who wrote The Thin Seam (1949)."]}, {"page": "Honno (publisher)", "response": ["The majority of titles are novels, autobiographies and short story anthologies in English; Honno also publishes some poetry, books for children and teenagers, and books in Welsh.Honno: Welcome to Honno!
