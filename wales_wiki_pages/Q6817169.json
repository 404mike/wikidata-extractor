It was reprinted by Honno, the Welsh Women's Press, in 2003, with an introduction by Angela John. It was dramatised by BBC Radio 4 in 2012. by Diana Griffiths.\nMan's Desiring (1960) was described by a reviewer as a novel with \"warm and winning ways\" a gentle comedy of contrasts about a Welsh man and an English woman at a Midlands university.The Small Mine tells the tale of a young collier's death in an industrial accident in the same fictional village created in Strike for a Kingdom. It was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 2004 by Diana Griffiths.\nTravels with a Duchess is the journey of a menopausal wife from Cardiff who loses her luggage en route to Yugoslavia and abandons her usual ways in favor of adventure and 'debauchery'.", "link_mentions": {}}}
