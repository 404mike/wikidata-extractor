He was born in Halkyn, Flintshire, to Hugh Ingleby and Ann Davies, where he lived for most of his life. The Inglebys originally came from Derbyshire to Flintshire where they worked the lead mines at Halkyn; four years after John Ingleby's death, the family went bankrupt.When he died in 1808 at his home village, church records indicate that he worked as a \"limner\" \u2013 a craftsmen who worked on a small scale, who was well established.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Pennant", "response": ["In 1754, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and resigned his fellowship because \"my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and that I never should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society.\"Literary Life. p. 2 When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the \"Pennant Collection\", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffith and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.", "The artist Moses Griffith, a native of Bryncroes in the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, provided illustrations to most of Pennant's books. He was employed full-time by Pennant and accommodated at Downing. Many of these paintings are included in the Pennant Collection held by the National Museum of Wales. Another artist whom Pennant employed on an occasional basis was John Ingleby of Halkyn. He mostly supplied town scenes and vignettes."]}, {"page": "John Ingleby", "response": ["John Ingleby or Ingilby may refer to:", "* John Ingleby (bishop) (1434\u20131499), Bishop of Llandaff, Wales", "* Sir John Ingleby, 3rd Baronet (1664-1742), of the Ingilby baronets", "* Sir John Ingleby, 4th Baronet (c.1705-1772), of the Ingilby baronets", "* John Ingleby (painter) (1749-1808), Welsh water colour painter patronised by Thomas Pennant", "* John Ingleby (Australian politician), represented the South Australian electorate of Victoria 1875-1877"]}, {"page": "Architecture of Wales", "response": ["At Carrog near Corwen parts of Owain's Prison stood, possibly into the 20th century. Thomas Pennant wrote in about 1776 that \"The prison where Owen confined his captives was not far from his house, in the parish of Llansantfraid Glyndwrdwy and the place is to this day called 'Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy'. Some remains are still to be seen near the church, which form part of a habitable house. It consists of a room 13 feet square and ten and a half high. The sides consist of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches asunder, mortised into them. In these are groves in the bottom, as if there had been cross bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly strong, composed of strong planks almost contiguous. It seems as if there had been two stories; but the upper part at present is evidently modern\".Pennant T, (1784) Tour in Wales. Bridge Books reprint, Wrexham, 1990, Vol 1, 387\u20138 In 1794 John Ingleby was employed to make a watercolour record of the building, which stood just to the SE of the church and overlooked the River Dee. The building was thatched and has some timber close studding and also a Gothic arched window and Gothic arched doors. There seems to be evidence for an outer stair leading to a first floor hall, which suggests that parts of the building could well have been contemporary with Owain Glynd\u0175r. The site of the building was on the modern Glynd\u0175r Terrace.", "Another building that might be of considerable antiquity is the Parliament House of Edward III in Rhuddlan where it was thought that the Statute of Rhuddlan was promulgated. Thomas Pennant remarks in 1778, \"A piece of antient building called the Parlement is still to be seen in Rhuddlan: probably where the king sat in council.\"Pennant T. (1778\u201384)A Tour in Wales, pp 15\u201316 Pennant was to get John Ingleby to provide a watercolour of the building. Today the building still partially stands in Parliament Street, with a late 13th-century doorway and a 14th-century cusped ogee door head.Hubbard\", (1985), 426. There is no definite evidence that this building is connected with Edward III.", "thumb|Althrey Hall, Bangor on Dee. Watercolour by John Ingleby 1794 ", "A later and more developed example of Renaissance architecture is Ruperra Castle, built in 1628 for the Welshman Sir Thomas Morgan and the design ideas may originate from his travels on the Continent. The castle is rectangular in layout with round towers at the corners. A feature of Ruperra is the rectangular three light windows with drip moulds, with the centre light higher than the side lights.\"RCAHMW\", (1981), 262\u20138 These windows appear on other Welsh Renaissance houses. The Castle is rectangular with round corner towers and a Porch with a classical doorway. As the result of a fire in 1941 it now stands partly ruined. In the north-east of Wales a very important surviving Renaissance house was Plas Teg near Mold. Rectangular in form with rectangular corner towers it is the typical form of Renaissance house seen over much of Europe. A close parallel would be the first phase (unfinished) of Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland. Another important Renaissance house, demolished in 1973, was Brymbo Hall near Wrexham. The house was built for John Griffith in 1625 and a Baroque wing was added later in that century. The core of the house was in brick with a fine classical doorway.\"Lloyd\"(1986), 28 Fortunately a watercolour by John Ingleby in the National Library of Wales records this building. A further example of the Renaissance classicism was the Banqueting Hall at Margam Abbey. This was recorded by Thomas Dineley in 1684, but only the stone facade now remains, erected in its present position in 1835. It is three bays wide with fluted Ionic columns carrying richly detailed entablatures.\"Newman\"(1996), 430 Pl.58", "thumb|left|Llandrinio Bridge, Montgomeryshire (John Ingleby 1794)", "thumb|left|Kinmel Park, St Asaph, watercolour by John Ingleby 1794", "Neoclassical architecture came to north Wales mainly as a result of the influence of Samuel Wyatt.  Wyatt had worked for Robert Adam, the leading Neoclassical architect when he became the clerk of Works at Kedleston Hall in 1759. Between 1776 and 1779 he remodelled Baron Hill at Beaumaris on Anglesey for Viscount Bulkely, while his brother became estate manager for the Pennants at Penrhyn. Colvin remarks that Wyatt specialised in the designing of medium-sized country houses in an elegant and restrained neo-classical manner. Characteristic features of his houses were astylar elevations with prominent bowed projections which were domed and were either single or in pairs. His windows were often tripartite and overarched. He rarely deviated from the neo-classical, though he did a gothic revival building at Penrhyn Castle which was replaced by Hopper's Neo-Romanesque Castle. At Kinmel Park near St Asaph, around 1790, he built a stylish house for the Rev Edward Hughes, who derived great wealth from the development of the Parys Copper mines on Anglesey. This house had a bowed front and panels with classical swags, possibly of Coade stone. It was burnt down in 1841, but fortunately it was recorded in a watercolour by John Ingleby in 1794.\"Hubbard\" (1986), 280 A further house in this style was the Old Bishop's Palace in St Asaph which was probably by Samuel Wyatt,\"Hubbard\", (1986), Pl.72 while at Brynbella in Tremeirchion a London surveyor, Clement Mead built Brynbella, for Dr Johnson's friend Mrs Thrale. Bryn Bella was built between 1792 and 1795 with an ashlar facade and double bays and wings with pediments on either side.\"Hubbard\", (1986), 450\u20131, Pl.74 Another very fine bow fronted house, Gresford Lodge near Wrexham,  was built for John Parry by James Wyatt, the brother of Samuel Wyatt around 1790.\"Lloyd\" (1989) pg 26, Pl. This house was domed over the bow front with a semicircular portico with Ionic columns and tripartite overarched windows. Gresford Lodge was demolished around 1950 due to subsidence caused by coal mining.", "Plas Newydd was followed by the more remarkable Gothic mansion at Garth at Guilsfield in Montgomeryshire, built for Devereux Mytton, probably in the late 1790s.This work should be post 1794, when the old house at Garth was recorded by John Ingleby in a watercolour, now in the National Library of Wales.
