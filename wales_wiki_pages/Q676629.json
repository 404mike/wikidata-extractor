According to both Fairclough and Kenneth Griffith himself, McGoohan was so pressed for time that the actor was asked to write his own dialogue. While Leo McKern's Number Two is the same character that previously appeared, Kanner's Number 48 is almost certainly a different character from those he played in \"Living in Harmony\" (where his character in fact dies) and \"The Girl Who Was Death\", but it is unclear whether Griffith's character is the same one that was the Number Two in the latter episode.
