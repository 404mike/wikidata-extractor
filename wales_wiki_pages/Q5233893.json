Fuller and John Paul Scott and the award committee is the same as for the Dobzhansky Award. The Thompson and Rowe awards, are named after former president W. R. Thompson (1977), and David C. Rowe, a pioneer of Gene-Environment interaction research respectively. The Thompson is given for the oral presentation given by an associate (student) member, and judged as most outstanding during the annual meeting. The Rowe similarly recognises the most outstanding student poster presentation. The awards committee for these awards consists of the past president together with the three members-at-large of the executive committee. In addition, the society gives the annual Fulker Award for an outstanding paper published in Behavior Genetics.
