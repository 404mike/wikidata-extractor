At these times she would feel unattractive due to her pale complexion, and soon began using fake tan to darken her skin tone into what she later described as a \"dirty mess\" but at the time made her feel more attractive. Due to her pale skin tone Roberts found herself easily burning in the sun, which led to chronic pain; during the shoot of the Girls Aloud single \"Love Machine\" she had trouble filming due to severe burns which left her wanting to visit the hospital. During her time with Girls Aloud she filmed a television special titled Passions for which she travelled to Taiwan where she learnt about natural skin products, something she had been interested in due to her pale complexion and led her to develop the make-up line Dainty Doll. Following this Roberts began a stance against tanning, which saw her produce and star in a BBC Three investigative documentary titled Nicola Roberts: The Truth About Tanning in which she revealed her own personal tanning issues and those of men and women throughout the UK who have excessively used tanning beds. She met with families of individuals who had died from melanoma, which encouraged Roberts to become an advocate for the banning of underage usage of tanning beds. With the help of Julie Morgan, a member of the National Assembly for Wales, she produced a bill in support of the ban. At the launch of the bill Roberts said \"Going into the streets of Liverpool and interviewing the young girls who are obsessed with having a tan and feeling like they had to be brown to be seen as attractive, that whole mentality that they had gathered was just a bigger problem than I ever thought it was.\""]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Cardiff North || Julie Morgan || Labour || Julie Morgan || Labour"]}, {"page": "Natascha Engel", "response": ["Engel represents the Labour Party on the Board of Trustees of the UK Youth Parliament and has worked to encourage young people to participate in democracy.
