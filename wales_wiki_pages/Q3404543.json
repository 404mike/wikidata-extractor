After the death of Sadwrn, she remarried and became the mother of Saint Elian Geimiad.She seems to have become a nun, and lived at Llangan, Pembrokeshire: at Llangan, in the Vale of Glamorgan, she was deemed important enough for her image to be carved on the church cross. The nearby Ffynnon Ganna, Canna's Holy Well, was a site for pilgrimage for many centuries after her death.Her name also appears as part of two Cardiff districts: Canton (English translation of the Welsh Treganna, Saint Canna's Town); and Pontcanna (Welsh for Canna's Bridge).Canna's Feast day is celebrated on 25 October.A Masonic Lodge No. 6725, within South Wales Eastern Division, is named after Saint Canna.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
