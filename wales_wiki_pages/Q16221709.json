In the 2006\u201307 Magners League, however, Daniel became much more of a fixture in the Scarlets squad, playing 21 matches and scoring 10 tries, including a hat\u2013trick in the win over the Glasgow Warriors. Nathan Brew's arrival at the West Wales club made it more difficult for Daniel to hold down a spot in the Scarlets' starting XV in the 2007\u201308 Magners League, but Mark Jones absence at the 2007 Rugby World Cup provided him with a chance to prove himself before the competition for places intensified."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Llanelli Scarlets season", "response": ["Welsh internationals Dwayne Peel, Alix Popham and Matthew Watkins also agreed deals to move away from Stradey Park at the end of the season, while Mahonri Schwalger was signed on a short-term contract mid-season to cover for the injured Ken Owens.

Despite playing against the wind in the first half, the Scarlets scored an early penalty in the sixth minute, before Darren Daniel scored the first try of the game, crossing in the corner. Clinton Schifcofske scored three penalties in response to make the half-time score 10\u20139 to the visitors. The Scarlets then took full advantage of the wind in the second half, Stephen Jones putting over two penalties to put the result beyond doubt. The Scarlets' next match came five days later, when they travelled to Rodney Parade to take on the Newport Gwent Dragons. The game looked out of the Llanelli side's reach at half time, as they trailed 25\u20136, but two unanswered tries from Martin Roberts and Nathan Brew, a conversion and two further penalties from Stephen Jones pulled the score back to 25\u201324. Brew came close to putting the Scarlets into the lead with 11 minutes to go, but fumbled the ball before he could get to the line, while Stephen Jones put an easy drop goal wide moments later. Fortunately for him, after Robert Lewis conceded a penalty in front of the posts, Jones finally gave the Scarlets a two-point win with three minutes left to play.", "The team's next game came just three days later, at home to Connacht in the first of their final three games at Stradey Park. The Irish side opened the scoring with a penalty in the first minute, but those were to be their only points of the match as the Scarlets tore through the Connacht defence seemingly at will. Both Morgan Stoddart and Dafydd James broke the Connacht line before Deacon Manu scored the first try of the game, and then an almost identical one soon after to make the score 12\u20133 going into half-time. Two more tries came soon after the break, from Jonathan Davies and Nathan Brew, securing the try bonus point for the Scarlets. Man of the match Morgan Stoddart added two more before the end, with his tries separated by one from Mark Jones, to end the final Celtic League game at Stradey Park with a 45\u20133 win for the home side.", "|align=\"left\"|WG||align=\"left\"| Nathan Brew", "|  Nathan Brew"]}, {"page": "2003 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches", "response": ["Wales: 15.
