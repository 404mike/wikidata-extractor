He captained the Welsh team on nine occasions.\nBassett was not the fastest full back, but had a great positional sense on the field which ensured he was always close to the action. He was seen as one of the most devastating tacklers in the game, and many opposing backs would throw the ball into touch rather than allow Bassett to hit them in full flow.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1989 in Wales", "response": ["*19 February \u2013 Jack Bassett, Wales international rugby union player, 83"]}, {"page": "Penarth RFC", "response": ["Tommy Garrett and Tommy Crossman played a school-boy international for Wales against England in 1909.

Davey made a name for himself in the 1931 game against Ireland in Belfast. Ireland only need to beat Wales to win the Triple Crown, but Davey and Jack Bassett tackled with such brutal aggression that the opposite centre retired with concussion and his replacement was later knocked unconscious.
