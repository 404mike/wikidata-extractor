Bloch kept a war diary from his enlistment. Very detailed in the first few months, it rapidly became more general in its observations. However, says the historian Daniel Hochedez, Bloch was aware of his role as both a \"witness and narrator\" to events and wanted as detailed a basis for his historiographical understanding as possible. The historian Rees Davies notes that although Bloch served in the war with \"considerable distinction\", it had come at the worst possible time both for his intellectual development and his study of medieval society."]}, {"page": "Owain Glynd\u0175r", "response": ["* R.
