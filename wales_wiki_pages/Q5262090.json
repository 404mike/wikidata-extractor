As well as making up part of his ministerial portfolio, NRW had expressed concerns about the race tracks development. In an investigation undertaken by Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Jones CMG, his report published on 1 July 2014 concluded that Davies had breached the Ministerial Code. The report noted that in March 2013, Davies had been advised by his own department not to lobby even as the AM in the case of the race track, but had ignored this advice and had then written to NRW as the affected AM. The report also revealed that the First Minister had contacted Davies in August 2013, after Davies had expressed support for the circuit openly in quote to the Western Mail newspaper. Davies faced no punishment by the First Minister, but endured sustained calls for him to resign due to his behaviour."]}, {"page": "Derek Jones", "response": ["Derek Jones may refer to:", "* Derek Jones (civil servant), Permanent Secretary to the Welsh Government", "* Derek Jones (civil servant, born 1927) (1927\u20132008), British and Hong Kong government official", "* Derek Jones (mayor) (1927\u20132013), English Congregationalist missionary and politician in Botswana", "* Derek Jones (bishop) (born 1961), American Anglican bishop with the Church of Nigeria", "* Derek Jones (Canadian football) (born 1992), defensive back", "* Derek Jones (footballer) (1929\u20132006), footballer for Tranmere Rovers", "* Derek Jones (musician), American musician"]}, {"page": "Derek William Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Jones (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "Sir Derek Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Jones (civil servant)"]}, {"page": "Sir Derek William Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Jones (civil servant)"]}]}}
