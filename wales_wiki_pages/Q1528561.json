His career was much influenced by his conversion to the Church of England in his youth, and he became a pious believer on the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.\nA brilliant scholar and champion athlete while at university, Bulmer-Thomas wrote biographies and worked as a sub-editor on The Times during his early life. His experience in wartime Italian propaganda led him to doubt its value. Serving in the Attlee Labour Party government in junior roles made him resent the influence of the Labour left; he fell out with party policy on nationalisation and moved to the Conservative Party. He was a workaholic and after leaving politics he became a leading layman in the Church of England; an interest in historic buildings led him to set up the Friends of Friendless Churches group, which campaigns to prevent churches falling into disuse, and play a key role in founding the charity known today as The Churches Conservation Trust.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Menelaus of Alexandria", "response": ["* Ivor Bulmer-Thomas. \"Menelaus of Alexandria.\" Dictionary of Scientific Biography 9:296-302."]}, {"page": "Conon of Samos", "response": ["In astronomy, Conon wrote in seven books his De astrologia, including observations on solar eclipses.

Collectively, the parties forming the National Government won 67% of the votes and 554 seats out of 615. The bulk of the National Government's support came from the Conservative Party, and the Conservatives won 470 seats. The Labour Party suffered its greatest defeat, losing four out of every five seats compared with the previous election. The Liberal Party, split into three factions, continued to shrink and the Liberal National faction never reunited. Ivor Bulmer-Thomas said the results \"were the most astonishing in the history of the British party system\". It is the most recent election in which one party (the Conservatives) received an absolute majority of the votes cast (despite over 97% of the votes being cast for either a party or alliance led by a leader or recent ex-leader of the Labour Party), and the last UK general election not to take place on a Thursday. It would be the last election until 1997 in which a party won over 400 seats in the House of Commons."]}, {"page": "Friends of Friendless Churches", "response": ["The charity was formed by Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, a writer, former MP and a high church Anglican.Anglesey (2004) 'Thomas, Ivor Bulmer (1905\u20131993)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 7\u00a0August 2010.  He was the charity's Honorary Director until his death in 1993. The first executive committee included prominent politicians, artists, poets and architects, including John Betjeman, John Piper, Roy Jenkins, T. S. Eliot and Harry Goodhart-Rendel. Initially the charity campaigned and obtained grants for the repair and restoration of churches within its remit. The 1968 Pastoral Measure established the Redundant Churches Fund (now called Churches Conservation Trust). However, the Church Commissioners turned down a number of buildings that the executive committee considered worthy of preservation, including Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe, and St Peter's Church, Wickham Bishops. The charity therefore decided in 1972 to change its constitution, allowing it to acquire threatened buildings either by freehold or by lease. The tower of the church at Lightcliffe was the first property to be vested with the charity."]}, {"page": "Keighley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["||1942|| rowspan=\"2\" |Ivor Bulmer-Thomas || Labour"]}, {"page": "Theodosius of Bithynia", "response": ["*Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, \"Theodosius of Bithynia,\" Dictionary of Scientific Biography 13:319\u2013320.
