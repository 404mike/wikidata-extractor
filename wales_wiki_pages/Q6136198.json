He was a familiar part of that squad despite injuries, including one to his groin in 2004/05. In that season he earned an U19 cap for England.\nHe played 5 times for Wasps in the Premiership. In the 2005/06 season, Honeyben made his Premiership debut against Sale in February as well as starting 13 out of 16 matches for the A team. Making his second start for the senior side, Honeyben ran out against Worcester in March, and gained a place on the pitch in the final game of the season against Gloucester.\nThe following season saw Honeyben as a member of the winning A League side with 10 appearances, but a shoulder injury held him back for a large part of the season. He recovered just in time for the start of the 07/08 season and was a part of the Middlesex 7s side. Unfortunately injury forced Honeyben off the pitch and he underwent surgery on his knee ligaments, but soon returned to training.\nHoneyben had a successful 2008/9 season with the A side, although they couldn't claim the A League title for a third season. He then played for Exeter Chiefs.\nHe retired from playing to become a full-time coach with Wasps Academy.\nAs of 2017 he is head of rugby at RGS High Wycombe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Honeyben, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Honeyben"]}]}}
