The themes are darker than usual for Piney, who, like many artists at this time, were disillusioned by Trump, Brexit, the #MeToo movement, the growing wealth gap on the rise, gentrification pushing people out of their homes; then Piney lost a close friend, and had some health scares of her own, it was a very dark time for her.  \"You Are Here\" captures the collective experience of dealing with loss and adversity through her own personal lens.  Recording the album was a jam session, as Piney and her bandmates created the music spontaneously in the studio, sometimes in only one take, she worked with members of Gaz Coombes' touring band Garo Nahoulakian, Mike Monaghan, Nick Fowler and Tomas Greenhalf, as well as Rusty Bradshaw who played with Florence and the Machine and Harry Deacon who plays with Palace, and Razorlight.
