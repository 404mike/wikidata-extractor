Cary fled from his home to a nearby plantation (possibly that of former governor Robert Daniell) which had been fortified and armed with cannons and several dozen of Cary's supporters. On May 29, after failing to reach an agreement with Cary, Hyde decided  to attack this fortified position and he and his men were beaten back after a short battle. Cary gathered together a larger force and armed a small brigantine with several cannons and set off to attack Hyde's fortified plantation.  On June 30, Cary's attack was repulsed after the mast of the brigantine was shot and his men fled.  Cary regrouped and fortified a small island in the Pamlico Sound and began to rearm his followers. They then sailed to mainland Carolina and met Hyde's force face to face. A fierce battle broke out. Little is known about the battle.   Quakers themselves are generally pacifists so it is unlikely that many Quakers took part in the violence themselves but rather that Cary's force was made up of Bath County men and non-Quaker dissenters.
