He played on the Nationwide Tour from 1999 to 2004, 2006 to 2007, and 2009 to 2010.\nAt the 2009 Michael Hill New Zealand Open on the Nationwide Tour, Johnson scored a hole in one on the par-4 15th hole for which he won a pallet of Heineken beer. He was only the second Nationwide Tour golfer to score a hole-in-one on a par-4 (Chip Beck was the first in 2001).His father Peter Johnson is the former pro at Vale of Glamorgan in Cardiff, Wales and is chairman of the PGA in Wales. Peter Johnson is now the professional at Ridgeway Golf Club in Caerphilly.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Korn Ferry Tour", "response": ["|2007 ||  Richard Johnson || align=center|445,421 ||  Nick Flanagan"]}, {"page": "Roland Thatcher", "response": ["On the Nationwide Tour in 2007, Thatcher got off to a slow start missing the cut three times in his first four tournaments.  Things then improved tremendously as he had five top-25 finishes in a row, including a playoff loss to Nick Flanagan at the Henrico County Open where he earned $33,600.  After another missed cut, he then had another three top-25 finishes, including a tie for 3rd at the LaSalle Bank Open in Chicago earning him another $43,500.  On July 1, he won the 2007 Peek'n Peak Classic and set a new tournament record at 15-under-par.  His victory was worth $108,000 and moved him from 10th into 4th place on the Nationwide Tour money list.  He was also awarded the Nationwide Tour Player of the Month for June. Thatcher continued his hot play in July as he won for the second time in 2007.  With a final score of 24-under-par, he won the Cox Classic by one stroke over Australian Jason Day. The victory earned him $117,000 and moved him into first place on the Nationwide Money list. Thatcher was not able to hold on to the number one spot on the 2007 Nationwide Tour money list though. After his win at the Cox Classic he played in 10 tournaments and only made five cuts. He led the money list going into the Nationwide Tour Championship at Barona Creek but finished in a tie for 29th place while Richard Johnson went on to win the tournament and money list crown. In 28 tournaments he recorded six top-10 finishes and fifteen top-25 finishes. Thatcher finished in 2nd place on the final 2007 Money List, earning his PGA Tour card for 2008. He also became only the third player in Nationwide Tour history to earn at least $400,000 in one year."]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*1989 Raymond Burns, Colin Fraser, Ian
