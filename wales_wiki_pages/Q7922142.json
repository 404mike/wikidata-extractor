He first played for Somerset during their successful 1890 season. He made his top-score of 116 against Kent in 1898, sharing a seventh wicket partnership of 240 with Sammy Woods. He was an infrequent bowler, claiming 31 career first-class wickets with his right-arm fast-medium bowling, but never taking more than six wickets in a season. Hill twice toured the United States of America, first as a member of F Mitchell's XI, and then as a member of PF Warner's XI.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["| Vernon Hill"]}, {"page": "Woodspring Priory", "response": ["The farmhouse was damaged by fire in 1897.

In 1932 it was the venue for Alan Cobham's Flying Circus providing aviation displays. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune."]}, {"page": "Herbie Hewett", "response": ["Hewett began the 1893 season in good form, reaching his half-century in each of his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton for the first time since 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself.Roebuck (1991), pp. 66\u201367. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills.Foot (1986), pp. 42\u201345. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead.Woods (1925), pp. 51\u201352. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that \"the decision not to play was premature.\" At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that \"Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once.\" David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's \"mind wasn't on the game.\" No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that \"if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him.\" Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Vernon Hill (1891\u20131912) 121 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of people from Cardiff", "response": ["| Right-handed batsman, played for Somerset; elder brother of Vernon Hill"]}, {"page": "Edward Stock Hill", "response": ["In 1866, he married Fanny Ellen Tickell.
