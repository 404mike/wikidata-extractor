A captain in the 15th Royal Welch Fusiliers, part of the 38th (Welsh) Division during the First World War, he is known for his memoir, Up to Mametz, which he wrote in the early 1920s, although the work was not published until 1931.\nGriffith was a career civil servant, and rose to a senior post in the Inland Revenue. He was a key helper to Sir Ernest Gowers in the writing of Plain Words in 1948. He was a well-known broadcaster, a founder-member of the Round Britain Quiz team. After retirement from the Inland Revenue he served as vice chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain. He was appointed CBE in the 1961 Birthday Honours.\nA continuation of his World War memoir, based on research into Griffith's papers, was published in 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Complete Plain Words", "response": ["Government departments sent Gowers many examples of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was Llewelyn Wyn Griffith of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged in the prefaces to Plain Words and its two successors.Gowers (1954), p. iv"]}, {"page": "Christmas truce", "response": ["An account by Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, recorded that after a night of exchanging carols, dawn on Christmas Day saw a \"rush of men from both sides... [and] a feverish exchange of souvenirs\" before the men were quickly called back by their officers, with offers to hold a ceasefire for the day and to play a football match. It came to nothing, as the brigade commander threatened repercussions for lack of discipline and insisted on a resumption of firing in the afternoon.Brown (2005) pp. 75\u201376. The unit was the 15th Royal Welch Fusiliers, a battalion of the volunteer New Armies, which were arriving in France in late 1915 and early 1916. Griffith mentions Christmas Day was \"the first time [he] had seen no-man's land\"; his men were possibly also on their first tour in the front line. Another member of Griffith's battalion, Bertie Felstead, later recalled that one man had produced a football, resulting in \"a free-for-all; there could have been 50 on each side\", before they were ordered back.Riley (2017), p. 717 Another unnamed participant reported in a letter home: \"The Germans seem to be very nice chaps, and said they were awfully sick of the war.\"Riley (2017), p. 722; quoting letter published in Wrexham Advertiser, 9 January 1915. In the evening, according to Robert Keating \"The Germans were sending up star lights and singing \u2013 they stopped, so we cheered them & we began singing Land of Hope and Glory \u2013 Men of Harlech et cetera \u2013 we stopped and they cheered us. So we went on till the early hours of the morning\".Riley (2017), p. 720"]}, {"page": "38th (Welsh) Infantry Division", "response": ["On 19 September 1914, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George stated publicly that he \"should like to see a Welsh Army in the field\". This thought quickly picked up support from politicians and from Kitchener; a Welsh Army Corps of two divisions totalling 50,000 men was approved on 10 October. The recruits were to be drawn from Wales as well as Monmouthshire and from Welshmen living in Liverpool, London and Manchester. The creation of the corps soon became a source of dispute between Lloyd George and Kitchener and was never realised due to a lack of potential recruits. Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, an officer within the 38th (Welsh) Division, commented that \"the population of Wales was not sufficient to raise two full divisions and all the corps units required\". By the end of 1914, it had been decided that only one division would be raised. The 10,000 men, who had since joined the Welsh Army Corps, were formed into the 43rd Division of Kitchener's Fifth New Army. The division comprised the 113th, 114th and 115th Brigades, and was made up of battalions from the Royal Welsh Fusiliers (RWF), the South Wales Borderers (SWB) and the Welsh Regiment (Welsh). On 19 January 1915, Major-General Ivor Philipps was assigned as the first divisional commander. By March, 20,000 men had been enlisted and over the coming months the first units reached full strength. Despite steady recruitment, by 30 June 1915, 20 per cent of recruits had been removed, having been discharged primarily for medical reasons or transferred to other units leaving 27,836 men within the ostensible Welsh Army Corps. The division was made up predominately of Welshmen, but it included soldiers from the rest of the United Kingdom and several other nations."]}, {"page": "Llywelyn", "response": ["*Llewelyn Wyn Griffith (1890\u20131977), Welsh novelist"]}, {"page": "1977 in Wales", "response": ["*27 September - Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, author of Up to Mametz, 87"]}, {"page": "1962 in Wales", "response": ["*Llewelyn Wyn Griffith \u2013 The Adventures of Pryderi"]}, {"page": "1935 in Wales", "response": ["*Llewelyn Wyn Griffith \u2013 Spring of YouthNational Library of Wales ", "Dr Llewelyn Wyn Griffith Papers].
