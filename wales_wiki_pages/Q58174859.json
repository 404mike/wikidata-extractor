In an attempt to improve the club's goalscoring record, Stan Davies was signed from fellow First Division side Birmingham. Two others, Leslie Jones and Emlyn John also arrived from nearby Welsh sides Aberdare Athletic and Mid Rhondda respectively. Cardiff had undertaken a tour of Denmark at the end of the previous season and had shown interest in signing Creutz Jensen, who had impressed the club's delegation in one match. The board secured his signing on a free transfer but he was denied a work permit by the Ministry of Labour and the move, which would have seen him become the first foreign player in the club's history, subsequently collapsed."]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Davies would appear in two further matches, a defeat against Charlton Athletic on 27 September and a victory over Barnsley a week later before appendicitis ruled him out for more than four months. The latter fixture also ended Emlyn John's season when he suffered a broken ankle in a collision with an opposition player; the injury left Cardiff with ten players out injured during the early part of the campaign. Cardiff gained only one further point in October, during a 1\u20131 draw against Nottingham Forest, but began November positively by winning consecutive matches against Southampton and Reading. The latter victory saw Robbins score his second brace of the season while recent arrival Albert Valentine scored his first goals for the club as Cardiff ran out 5\u20130 winners. The side scored only once in their next three matches, defeats against Stoke City, Bradford and Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 6 December, Robbins scored the side's first league hat-trick of the season in a 4\u20134 draw with Millwall. Although they suffered a heavy 7\u20130 defeat to Preston North End a week later, Cardiff again scored four on 20 December, defeating Burnley with Robbins adding another brace."]}]}}
