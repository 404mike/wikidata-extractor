Lewis (born 14 March 1969) is a Welsh astrophysicist, who is best known for his work on dark energy, gravitational lensing and galactic cannibalism.\n\nLewis is a Professor of Astrophysics (Teaching and Research) at the Sydney Institute for Astronomy, part of the University of Sydney's School of Physics. He is head of the Gravitational Astrophysics Group. He was previously the Associate Head for Research at the School of Physics, and held an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship between 2011 and 2015. Lewis won the 2016 Walter Boas Medal in recognition of excellence in research in Physics. In 2021, he was awarded the David Allen Prize of the Astronomical Society of Australia for exceptional achievement in astronomy communication.In April 2020, Geraint was elected as a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales. He is also an elected fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales.\nUntil the end of 2020, he held the position of Deputy Director of the Sydney Informatics Hub, a \nCore Research Facility\nof the University of Sydney.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alcubierre drive", "response": ["Brendan McMonigal, Geraint F.
