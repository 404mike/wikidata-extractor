Many accusations were made, but finding proof made convicting women as witches rather difficult. The first witch to be trialled and executed in Wales was Gwen ferch Ellis of Llandyrnog. She was accused of using a poppet (a figurine fashioned to look like a specific person, used for spell casting) and casting a destructive charm. Charms were common in this time and often used for healing, an art which Gwen herself took part in, however this specific charm was written backwards and as per the traditions of the time this meant that it was meant for harm."]}, {"page": "Witchcraft in early modern Wales", "response": ["In 1594, in Llandyrnog, Gwen ferch Ellis, 42, was the first person to be executed as a witch in Wales. The accusations were that, although she otherwise was known to provide healing, she had turned to do evil. These accusations were based on a charm that was found to be written backwards, and this was thought to be an example of the act of bewitching. After the trial, she was sentenced to death."]}]}}
