In September 1957, Aubrey Jones, the  Minister of Supply, was keen to support the programme and had agreed to continue funding development of five of the six prototypes. However, according to Wood, the SR.177 was subject to political in-fighting between Aubrey Jones and Duncan Sandys, the minister who had been the prime advocate of the Defence White Paper. While Jones assured German officials that the SR.177 project was continuing, Sandys contacted them to inform them that the aircraft was effectively dead. These mixed messages led to considerable confusion and apprehension within the German Defence Ministry. Further difficulty was added when, in response to lobbying by Rolls-Royce Limited, the German government insisted that the Rolls-Royce RB.153 engine be used in place of the Gyron Junior, causing Saunders-Roe to work on a further hasty redesign of SR.177."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Aubrey Jones (1911\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "Fairey Rotodyne", "response": ["By 1958, the Treasury was already expressing its opposition to further financing for the programme.

Considerable importance was placed upon BEA supporting the Rotodyne by issuing and order; however, the airline refused to procure the aircraft until it was satisfied that guarantees were given over its performance, economy, and noise criteria. Shortly after Fairey's merger with Westland, the latter was issued with a \u00a34 million development contract for the Rotodyne, which was intended to see the type enter service with BEA as a result."]}, {"page": "Minister of Supply", "response": ["| The Right HonourableAubrey JonesMP for Birmingham Hall Green"]}, {"page": "Andrew Duncan (businessman)", "response": ["During his time in ministerial office, there was some concern that someone so closely involved with the iron, steel and chemical industries was in charge of their regulation.
