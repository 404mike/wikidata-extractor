O. Davies", "response": ["Unlike the British communists, Davies did not change his position when the Soviet Union entered the war in June 1941. He continued to oppose all co-operation with the Conservatives, believing that only through socialism could a just and lasting peace be achieved. Victory in 1945, and the subsequent election of a Labour government, did little to affect Davies's individualism. In the Labour years 1945\u201351, he opposed government policies on conscription, NATO, the development of nuclear weapons, and intervention in the Korean War. According to his biographer Robert Griffiths, it was hatred of capitalist militarism, rather than a wish to support the Soviet Union, that underlay Davies's stances. His popularity in South Wales was unaffected: he was returned to parliament in each postwar election with large majorities. In 1945\u201346, he served as Merthyr Tydfil's mayor, remaining on the local council until 1949."]}, {"page": "Robert Griffiths", "response": ["Robert Griffiths may refer to:", "*Robert Griffiths (politician) (born 1952), British communist politician", "*Robert Griffiths (physicist) (born 1937), American physicist", "*Robert Griffiths (mathematician), Australian statistician"]}, {"page": "Workers' Institute of Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong Thought", "response": ["Robert Griffiths, general secretary of the Communist Party of Britain, said of the group in November 2013: \"if one were to be brutally honest they were more of psychiatric interest than political interest.
