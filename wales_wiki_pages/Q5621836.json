In 2009, Mehdi Hasan wrote in the New Statesman that the BBC was biased \"towards power and privilege, tradition and orthodoxy\". He said that the view that the BBC was biased to the left, which he said had been \"internalised even by liberals and leftists\", \"is a calculated and cynical move by the right to cow the corporation into submission\". Giving as examples Andrew Neil, Nick Robinson, Robbie Gibb and Guto Harri he wrote that the rightwing backgrounds of \"various prominent BBC employees have been curiously unexamined in the row over \"bias\" \". In 2014, The Guardian columnist Owen Jones wrote that \"research actually suggests the BBC's output is biased towards establishment and rightwing sources\" and that the BBC is \"stacked full of rightwingers\", mentioning by name chairman of the BBC Trust Chris Patten, political editor Nick Robinson, Thea Rogers, Andrew Neil, Neil's editor Robbie Gibb and Kamal Ahmed."]}, {"page": "1966 in Wales", "response": ["*8 July \u2013 Guto Harri, broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Ysgol Llanhari", "response": ["*Guto Harri, former BBC Chief Political Correspondent, Communications Director for the Mayor of London's administration"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Guto Harrinot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Welsh independence", "response": ["In January 2021, Guto Harri, who was Boris Johnson's communications chief when the latter was Mayor of London, wrote in The Sunday Times that \"the idea of independence is taking off, with new recruits from very different backgrounds.\" He went on to say, \"Brexiteers will hate me for saying this, but it is clear that some have contributed more to the cause of Welsh independence than my late father. The prospect of being attached to a leftover English rump of the UK, if Scotland and Northern Ireland head off, seems bleak to many people.
