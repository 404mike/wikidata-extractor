Like many young activists of his generation he attended the Central Labour College in London from 1923\u201325, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the 1926 General Strike he was imprisoned for three months in Swansea Prison for his trade union activities in the Nottinghamshire coalfield.\nOnce back at the pits, he became chairman and then checkweighman of the Cambrian Lodge of the South Wales Miners Federation. Although often seen as a lesser post to that of Lodge Chairman, in a time of industrial unrest the checkweighman was a vital part of the miners' protection against employers using piece work rules to drive down wages, and it was a role in which Jones was likely to routinely come into conflict with management.\nIn 1929, he resigned, refusing to work with 'scab' (non-unionised) labour. He remained unemployed for the rest of his life, although, he was likely to be permanently busy on political business. He was extremely popular amongst the rank-and-file Party members, but his association with \"Hornerism\" (Communists working within established trades unions), his turbulent private life and his distrust of the cult of personality (he was sent home from the Soviet Union for ignoring a standing ovation to Joseph Stalin) meant that he was repeatedly suspended and disciplined by the Party. As the Welsh organiser for the National Unemployed Workers Movement, widely regarded as a Communist front, he led the 1932, 1934 and 1936 hunger marches to London. Also in 1936, he was elected as one of the two Communist members on to the Glamorgan County Council. In South Wales at this time his attachment to the Communist Party would not have harmed his reputation as a political activist and leader.\nLewis Jones died on 27 January 1939 at the end of a day in which he addressed over 30 meetings in support of the republican side of the Spanish Civil War. He is buried at Trealaw Cemetery in Trealaw.\nHis books provide a description of life in a Welsh mining community of their time; there is an awareness of the crisis of masculinity that mass unemployment brought home to those communities, and the description of workers in struggle with their employers is unflinching in its acknowledgement of defeat as well as victory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Welsh literature in English", "response": ["An early work of the first wave of Anglo-Welsh writers was The Withered Root (1927) by Rhys Davies (1901\u201378) from the Rhondda Valley. While he probably wrote more fiction about the industrial world of the South Wales Valleys than anyone else, Rhys Davies was in fact a grocer's son who was living in London by the time he was twenty. Unlike that of other writers from the mining community, his fiction is more concerned with individuals, in particular women, than with politics.A Hundred Years of Fiction, p.64. D. H. Lawrence was a major influence on Rhys, though similarities with Caradoc Evans have been noted, and it has been suggested that he had \"The tendency to process images of the Welsh valleys for consumption by English audiences\".A Pocket Guide, p.104. Another Anglo-Welsh novelist (and playwright) was Jack Jones (1884\u20131970), a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938).

By 1936 there were seven communists on Rhondda Urban District Council and the branch was publishing its own newspaper The Vanguard.Hopkins (1975), p. 70.

The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support of some of the largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.Morgan (1988), p. 102."]}, {"page": "Tonypandy riots", "response": ["Purported eyewitness accounts of alleged shootings persisted and were relayed by word of mouth. In some instances it was said there were many shots and fatalities. There are no records of any shots being fired by troops.  The only recorded death was Samuel Rhys. In the autobiographical \"documentary novel\" Cwmardy, the later  communist trade union organiser Lewis Jones presents a stylistically romantic, but closely detailed, account of the riots and their agonising domestic and social consequences. The account was criticised for its creative approach to truth. For example, in the chapter \"Soldiers are sent to the Valley\", he narrates an incident, in which eleven strikers are killed by two volleys of rifle fire in the town square, after which the miners adopt a grimly retaliatory stance. In this account, the end of the strike is hastened by organised terror directed at mine managers, leading to introduction of a minimum-wage act by the government \u2013 hailed as a victory by the strikers. The accuracy of this account is disputed.

Lewis Jones (1897\u20131939), and Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999), and poet Idris Davies (1905\u201353). Jack Jones was a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897\u20131939) largely autobiographical novel. Gwyn Thomas (1913\u201381) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905\u201353), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh \"but rebellion against chapel religion\", along with the \"inspirational influence of English\" poets, led him to write in English. Gwalia Deserta (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of The Angry Summer (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. Rhys Davies, author of A Time To Laugh (1937), and Menna Gallie, author of Strike for a Kingdom (1959) and The Small Mine (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of South Wales.
