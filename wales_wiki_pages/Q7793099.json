In 1817 Thomas Rickman published his An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest To the Reformation. It was now realised that round-arch architecture was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon.This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman's article in Archaeologia (1837), was published by the Society of Antiquaries. The start of an archaeologically correct Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of Thomas Hopper. His first attempt at this style was at Gosford Castle in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his Penrhyn Castle near Bangor. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837.  The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which was a mixed Gothic style.Mowl, Timothy (1991) Penrhyn and the Norman Revival in \"National Trust Guide\", Penrhyn Castle, Gwynedd. pp.89\u201390. The Welsh architect Thomas Penson, however, built churches in this style in Montgomeryshire", "thumb|left|Garthmyl Hall with the Gold/Naylor Coat of Arms in terracotta set in the pediment One of the earliest architects to make use of this source was the Welsh architect Thomas Penson, who worked from offices in Oswestry. There appears to be good evidence that he sourced his terracotta from the brickyards which were associated with the Oswestry coalfield at Morda and Trefonen on the Welsh border.\"Stratton\", (1993). pg. 51 Penson used terracotta moulding for church architecture, most notably St Davids, Newtown and Christ Church, Welshpool. As yet no examples the use of the terracotta from these brickyards for domestic buildings is known, although the Trefonen brickyard, which was described as a terracotta works,   was later owned by the railway engineer Thomas Savin and may have been used for some of his projects. James Kellaway Colling used extensive terracotta decoration for Garthmyl Hall, Berriew in Berriew in Montgomeryshire. This was almost certainly sourced from J M Blashfield's terracotta works at Stamford. ", "During the latter part of the 18th century and during the 19th century, the laying out of towns, villages and industrial settlements gathered momentum. It was work often done by architects and land-surveyors. The layout and design of Aberaeron can now be confidently assigned to Edward Haycock and he probably also involved in the development of Aberystwyth. William Jernagen of Swansea is likely to have laid out the three parallel streets forming the core of Milford Haven in 1792\u20133.\"Lloyd\" (2003), 287,  At Newtown the development of the Crescent and Penygloddfa to the work of Thomas Penson.  The grid pattern layout at Pembroke Docks has been attributed to the land surveyor George Gwyther, while the Royal Dockyard and its buildings were probably to the original design of John Rennie and carried out by Edward Holl, architect to the Navy Board.\"Lloyd\" (2003), 341, In the 19th century many estate villages were laid out by large landowners, often by the architects, in order to build or rebuild their own houses. Intriguingly Lord Sudeley at Gregynog was to experiment in 1870 with concrete houses for his estate workers at Tregynon\"Alfrey\", (1998), 206, Pl.8 ", "*Berriew is best remembered for its half-timbered cottages which cluster around the churchyard and along the banks of the river Rhiew.  These can probably be attributed to Thomas Penson.  In the late 1830s, at the same time as Penson was working on remodelling Vaynor Park in Berriew for John Winder Lion-Winder, he was also remodelling and building houses in Berriew for the Vaynor estate.Cadw (1999) Register of Landscapes, Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales: Powys. Cardiff, pg. 255.  As a result of his work Berriew developed as a village with many attractive Cottage Orn\u00e9e houses. Some of these were rebuilt from earlier timber framed buildings, while others were built in a Tudor Revival style and are some of the earliest examples of Black-and-white Revival architecture. Penson's work can be recognised by the massive brick chimney stacks which have been added to the houses, the ornamental bargeboards to the gables and in some cases the black and white painting on the brick work to give the impression of timber framing.Alfrey J.(2001), Rural Building in Nineteenth-Century North Wales: The Role of the Great Estates, Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol 147, pg 213, pl.18."]}, {"page": "Richard Kyrke Penson", "response": ["He was born at Overton-on-Dee, Flintshire, Wales, in 1815, the eldest son of Thomas Penson II, an architect and surveyor of Gwersyllt Hall near Wrexham, who had offices in Willow Street, Oswestry, and his wife Frances (nee Kirk).

"]}, {"page": "Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom", "response": ["A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from Samuel Pepys Cockerell for the conservation and rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Tickencote in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate chancel arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The nave was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel. This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840s under architectects such as Thomas Penson and Benjamin Ferrey. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture.", "However, the Norman Revival did catch on for church architecture. It was Thomas Penson, a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper\u2019s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German Brick Gothic. At St David\u2019s Newtown, 1843\u201347 and St Agatha\u2019s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of St. Salvator's Cathedral, Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are Christ Church, Welshpool, 1839\u20131844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of terracotta to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework. Penson\u2019s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was Rhosllannerchrugog, Wrexham of 1852", "thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844\u201346 The work of Benjamin Ferrey can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at East Grafton in Wiltshire, built in 1842\u201344. Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and chevron decoration over the entrance door.

A redesigned timber bridge was destroyed after the River Severn flooded in 1852 and a subsequent bridge fell in 1858. The present-day bridge was designed by Thomas Penson making it the third cast-iron bridge in Montgomeryshire and was renovated in the early 21st century.", "Caerhowel Bridge is located approximately  south of the A483 road at Garthmyl and the bridge carries the B4385 road. The bridge is made of cast-iron, with stone abutments and one central pier. It is  wide and is broader than its equivalents in the villages of Llandinam and Abermule. The bridge's pier extends to the east (upstream) side which forms a low-level cutwater. Its deck is installed with cast-iron outer girders with raised panel ornament which bear the inscriptions 'Thomas Penson County Surveyor 1858' and 'Brymbo Company Iron Founders 1858'.", "An earlier bridge was built around 1250 and was called Baldwin's Bridge. It was possibly destroyed sometime in the latter half of the 13th century although later records recorded a timber bridge at the site around 1600; it had various names such as Montgomery Bridge, Severn Bridge or New Bridge. The timber bridge was destroyed in 1852, when the River Severn flooded. Thomas Penson, the county surveyor of Montgomeryshire, recommended to the local council the authorisation of the construction of a single-arch iron bridge which was rejected in favour of a suspension bridge designed by civil engineer James Dredge, Sr. The new designed bridge opened in 1854; it was designed on Dredge's patented taper-chain principle and was supported by chains. It collapsed in early 1858 whilst lime from Garthmyl Wharf was being transported by horse; a man called Richard Grist was killed. At an inquest into the collapse it was determined that Caerhowel Bridge had not been maintained sufficiently to secure the safety of transport crossing the bridge."]}]}}
