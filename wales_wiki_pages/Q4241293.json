The village, about  from the building, takes its name from the church. Reputedly founded by St Cristiolus in 610, the present building dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. Alterations were made in the 16th century, when the large east window in Perpendicular style was added to the chancel \u2013 a window which has been described by one guide to the buildings of north Wales as \"almost too big to fit\" in the wall.

It is situated just to the south of the A5 and A55 roads, on raised ground above Malltraeth Marsh.  The modern village of Llangristiolus is about  to the west of the church. The village takes its name from the church: the Welsh word  originally meant \"enclosure\" and then \"church\", and \"-gristiolus\" is a modified form of the saint's name.", "The date of foundation of the first building on this site is unknown.

Cristiolus is also credited with the foundation of the church in Eglwyswrw in modern-day Pembrokeshire, south Wales. He was the brother of St Rhystud, who established the church at Llanrhystud in mid-Wales.", "St Cristiolus's Church is still in regular use and belongs to the Church in Wales. It is one of six churches in the combined benefice of Plwyf Seintiau Braint a Chefni.
