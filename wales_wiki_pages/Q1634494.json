Thomas became interested in orthopedics and bone-setting at a young age, and after establishing his own practice, went on to expand the field into the general treatment of fracture and other musculoskeletal problems. He advocated enforced rest as the best remedy for fractures and tuberculosis, and created the so-called \"Thomas splint\" to stabilize a fractured femur and prevent infection. He is also responsible for numerous other medical innovations that all carry his name: Thomas's collar to treat tuberculosis of the cervical spine, Thomas's manoeuvre, an orthopedic investigation for fracture of the hip joint, the Thomas test, a method of detecting hip deformity by having the patient lying flat in bed, and Thomas's wrench for reducing fractures, as well as an osteoclast to break and reset bones."]}, {"page": "1891 in science", "response": ["* January 6 \u2013 Hugh Owen Thomas (born 1834), British orthopaedic surgeon."]}, {"page": "Splint (medicine)", "response": ["In the 1800s it was beginning to be recognized that rehabilitation after an injury was important. Orthopedics began to become a separate field from general surgery. A famous British Surgeon, Hugh Owen Thomas, created specialty splints that were cheap and best for injuries that were being rehabilitated. By 1883, mechanics and surgeons separated due to class issues. This created two different areas that shaped the way braces were being created and distributed. Around 1888, F. Gustav Ernst, a dedicated mechanic, released a book illustrating upper body splints. In 1899, orthopedic surgeon Alessandro Codivilla followed suit and published a book explaining the importance of using surgical procedures to set up better results using splints."]}, {"page": "List of eponymous medical signs", "response": ["|Thomas test || Hugh Owen Thomas ||Orthopaedics || Fixed flexion deformity of hip || || Supine patient flexes one hip whilst keeping other leg flat; back arches if flexion deformity is present"]}, {"page": "Hugh Thomas", "response": ["* Hugh Owen Thomas (1834\u20131891), Welsh surgeon"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Hugh Owen Thomas, father of orthopaedic surgery in Britain"]}, {"page": "Traction splint", "response": ["The first widely used model of traction splint was introduced by Hugh Owen Thomas, a Welsh surgeon, considered by many to be the father of modern orthopaedic surgery."]}, {"page": "UCL Medical School", "response": ["* Hugh Owen Thomas, father of orthopaedic surgery in Britain"]}, {"page": "1834 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 23 August \u2013 Hugh Owen Thomas, Welsh-born orthopaedic surgeon (died 1891)"]}, {"page": "1891 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 January \u2013 Hugh Owen Thomas, orthopaedic surgeon (born 1834)"]}, {"page": "1890s in Wales", "response": ["**Hugh Owen Thomas, pioneering orthopaedic surgeon (born 1834)"]}, {"page": "1891 in Wales", "response": ["*6 January \u2013 Hugh Owen Thomas, pioneering orthopaedic surgeon, 57"]}, {"page": "1875 in Wales", "response": ["*Hugh Owen Thomas - Diseases of the Hip, Knee, and Ankle Joints"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["**Hugh Owen Thomas (1834\u20131891), Welsh surgeon"]}, {"page": "1834 in Wales", "response": ["*23 August - Hugh Owen Thomas, orthopaedic surgeon (d. 1891)"]}, {"page": "H.
