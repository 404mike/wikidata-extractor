Their original line-up consisted of Burke Shelley on vocals and bass, Tony Bourge on guitar and vocals, and Ray Phillips on drums. After performing several gigs in 1968, the band changed their name to Budgie the following year and recorded their first demo. The band had initially considered going under the name \"Six Ton Budgie\", but decided the shorter single word variant was preferable. Burke Shelley has said that the band's name came from the fact that he, \"loved the idea of playing noisy, heavy rock, but calling ourselves after something diametrically opposed to that\".", "thumb|left|Burke Shelley and Steve Williams performing in 1981", "Budgie's music was described in the All-Music Guide as a cross between Rush and Black Sabbath. Burke Shelley's vocals have been compared to Geddy Lee due to his similar approach of high-pitched banshee wails (coincidentally, Shelley and Lee are also the bass players in their respective power-trio bands). Although Budgie remained quite obscure during their early career, many future stars of hard rock/metal have cited them as an important influence and covered their songs, including Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Van Halen, Melvins, Queens of the Stone Age, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.", "*Burke Shelley \u2013 lead vocals, bass "]}, {"page": "Bandolier (album)", "response": ["'Bandolier \u2013 Budgie', a free iTunes app for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, was released in December 2011.
