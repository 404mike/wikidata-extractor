A Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, he was known as a keen naturalist with great observational skills, as well as his paintings and illustrations. He wrote several articles on the fertilisation of plants, and his paintings of plants of southern France appeared in Contributions to the Flora of Mentone. His two volume study, Harvesting Ants and Trap-door Spiders, among other observations, confirmed that harvester ants are present in Europe, and was one of the first comprehensive treatments of the burrowing behaviour of trapdoor spiders. He was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, who cited his work in his books Fertilisation of Orchids and  The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.\nMoggridge was born in Swansea, Wales to a family already steeped in natural history.  His father, Matthew Moggridge, was a naturalist and geologist, a Fellow of the Linnean, Geological and Zoological Societies, while his mother, Fanny Moggridge, was the daughter of Lewis Weston Dillwyn, a naturalist and member of parliament. John attended King's School, Sherborne (now known as Sherborne School) in Dorset and in 1861 enrolled in Trinity College, Cambridge, but health problems interrupted his studies, causing him to relocate to the warmer climate of Menton, France, in the Provence region of southern France.He died in Menton of tuberculosis in 1874 at the age of 32, following a lengthy period of invalidity. He was posthumously commemorated in the genus name Moggridgea, a group of spiders named by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge, who also named a species of nemesiid spider (Nemesia moggridgii, now N. carminans) after Moggridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "More Letters of Charles Darwin", "response": ["* John Traherne Moggridge"]}, {"page": "Moggridgea", "response": ["The genus was first described by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1875, who named the genus after naturalist John Traherne Moggridge."]}, {"page": "Campanula isophylla", "response": ["The species is a trailing perennial. The flowers are star-shaped  and 3.5 centimeters across.  The flowers are either blue, white, or mauve. The flowers appear in late summer to autumn. The leaves are heart shaped, toothed, and light green. The species' height is 6 to 8 inches and its width is 12\u00a0inches. The green stems tumble down the sides of pots.  Campanula fragilis resembles the species. The species has been grown for generations. Author John Traherne Moggridge said in 1874 in one of his books that he proved that the seeds germinate freely and went on to say that they are so small that they might be transported by the wind alone, or adhere, without causing inconvenience, to the feet of small birds. A 1907 edition of Gardening Illustrated said that the blue flowers are rarer than the white flowers. The species is sometimes mislabelled as Campanula mollis in gardens. The difference between Campanula mollis and this species is the shape of the leaves. Volume 6 of The American journal of horticulture and florist's companion said that the flowers are of a most lovely blue color and last a considerable long time."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (M)", "response": ["* Moggr. \u2013 John Traherne Moggridge (1842\u20131874)"]}, {"page": "J.
