Sir Thomas Stradling (1495\u20131571) was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1561, following accusations of his having used the appearance of a \"miraculous\" cross in the trunk of an ash tree on the St Donat's estate to encourage support for the Catholic cause. His son, the scholar Edward Stradling (1528/9\u20131609) established a celebrated, and exceptionally large, library at St Donat's which was considered the finest in Wales of its time. The historian Graham Thomas records the Stradling tradition of educating their sons abroad, which led to the library holding extensive collections of foreign-language texts, particularly Italian works. Edward Stradling wrote a history of the area, The Winning of the Lordship of Glamorgan out of Welshmen's Hands, which established the legend of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, including the inaccurate claim that the first Stradlings had arrived with William the Conqueror, rather than some 200 years later. He was also the patron of Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys and funded the production and publication of the latter's Cambrobrytannicae Cymraecaeve Linguae Institutiones et Rudimenta, the first Welsh language grammar to be published in Latin and thus widely accessible."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys (1534 \u2013 c.\u20091609)"]}, {"page": "Rhys", "response": ["* Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys (1534 \u2013 c.\u20091609), Welsh physician and grammarian"]}, {"page": "17th century in Wales", "response": ["*probable - Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys, physician and grammarian, about 75"]}, {"page": "John Dafydd Rhys", "response": ["#REDIRECT Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys"]}, {"page": "Sion Dafydd Rhys", "response": ["#redirect Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys"]}, {"page": "John David Rhys", "response": ["#redirect Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys"]}]}}
