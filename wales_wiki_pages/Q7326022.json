Having played Second XI cricket for Glamorgan since 2001, 2004 also saw him make his first team debut for the county in August in a List A match against Warwickshire in the totesport League. He played a further match in that season's competition against Essex. The following season he made his first-class debut in the County Championship against Middlesex. The 2005 season also saw Grant make his Twenty20 debut against Gloucestershire in the Twenty20 Cup.\nOver the coming seasons, he made 24 further first-class appearances, playing his final first-class match against Northamptonshire in the 2008 County Championship. In his 25 first-class matches, Grant who played as an all-rounder, scored 888 runs at an average of 21.65, with a high score of 79. This score, which was one of four fifties, came against Northamptonshire in 2007. With the ball, he took 6 wickets at a bowling average of 44.66, with best figures of 1/7. In List A cricket, he made a total of 41 appearances, playing his final match in that format against Kent in the 2008 NatWest Pro40.
