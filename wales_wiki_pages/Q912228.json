The album was recorded in Rome and mastered at Abbey Road Studios by sound engineer Peter Mew, who also worked on Pretty Things and Tomorrow recordings in the 1960s. In 2014, Twink started recording a new album, Think Pink II, with a similar concept of recording, featuring as many guests as on the original.

A phenomenally ambitious double album, Sanity Stomp kicks off with two sides recorded alongside labelmates the Ruts, truly the most potent of the latter-day punk crew, and a seething accompaniment to some of Coyne's most blistering latter-day compositions. With the songs apparently written over the course of a single weekend, these two sides have an energy and immediacy that Coyne would not return to until One Day in Chicago, two decades later. Shift onto sides three and four, however, and the mood changes beyond recognition. Again, immediacy is the word, but the improvisation this time comes courtesy of Robert Wyatt, Brian Godding and co., busking artily to a series of Coyne lyrics and recitals, without any real regard for structure or song. Again, Coyne would return to similar pastures later in life, most notably his Opera for Syd' tribute to Syd Barrett. But there, at least, familiarity was bred in the tunes he was performing over. Here, there are few recognizable landmarks to cling to and, coming out of the fire storm of the album's first half, few albums have been so aptly titled.", "# \"Wonderful Wilderness\" (Brian Godding)", "# \"The World Speaks\" (Brian Godding)", "* Brian Godding \u2013 electric guitar and keyboards"]}, {"page": "1945 in jazz", "response": ["* 19 \u2013 Brian Godding, American guitarist."]}, {"page": "John Russell (musician)", "response": ["In 1983, he appeared in the Channel 4 TV documentary Jazz on Four: Crossing Bridges, which examined guitarists Brian Godding, Fred Frith, Ron Geesin, Hans Reichel, and Keith Rowe.Izzard, Bryan and Anthony, Neil (1983) Jazz on Four: Crossing Bridges, Channel 4 In 1988 Russell helped establish Acta Records with John Butcher and Phil Durrant to release the trio's debut album, Conceits.Acta Records list of recordings"]}, {"page": "Bursting Bubbles", "response": ["All tracks composed by Kevin Coyne and Brian Godding, except where indicated.", "* Brian Godding - guitar"]}, {"page": "X-Dreams", "response": ["* Brian Godding \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "On Duke's Birthday", "response": ["*Brian Godding - electric guitar"]}, {"page": "Godding", "response": ["*Brian Godding (born 1945), Welsh musician"]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1945 in jazz, deaths of Bobby Stark, Jack Jenney, Josef Taussig, Nat Jaffe, Pha Terrell, Richard M.
