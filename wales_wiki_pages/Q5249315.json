In 1967, young Australian men were also being conscripted to fight in the Vietnam War, and Robertson was inspired to compose several anti-war songs dealing with these events (\"Freedom Free For All\", \"Brother Jack\", \"Is It True?\"). He became well known on the local (then small) Australian folk scene and became involved in the first two Port Philip Folk Festivals which were held in Melbourne in 1967 and 1968, plus the 1969 Moreton Bay Folk Festival in Brisbane, which together are now more generally recognised as the first of the Australian National Folk Festivals.Andrews, Shirley: The National Folk Festival: How our National Folk Festival Started (Victorian Folk Music Club). Accessed 15 September 2018 Around this time (in 1967), the nationally well known Australian folk singers Declan Affley and Mike Ball included four of Robertson's compositions on their album The Rake And Rambling Man (subtitled \"Folk singers of Australia series; v. 1\") which helped to bring his writing to a greater prominence.", "Robertson was noted for his songs and poems about the lives of the whalers which he wrote without glorifying the industry, although his work also encompassed other topics including songs of other industries, both sea and land related; bawdy ballads; drinking songs; love songs, and songs of social protest.
