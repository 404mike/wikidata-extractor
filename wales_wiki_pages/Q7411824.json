He was later to work as a housemaster at Lancing College.Educated at Malvern College, he captained the cricket eleven in both 1921 and 1922.\nHis first-class debut came for Worcestershire against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare in August 1922. In a drawn match, Jagger took three first-innings wickets.\nHe also played for Worcestershire, as well as Cambridge University, the following season, but it was then discovered that his county qualification was invalid.\nDuring 1923, he made his only first-class half-century when he hit 58 for Cambridge against Essex.Jagger played no first-class cricket in 1924, but in the two years thereafter he appeared regularly for Cambridge and won his Blue. In early May 1925, he claimed his first five-wicket haul when he took 5\u201340 against Sussex at Fenner's.\nHe also claimed five-wicket bags for Cambridge that season against Free Foresters (taking nine in the match) and Surrey,\nthe three bowling feats coming within a space of six weeks. He ended 1925 with 41 first-class wickets (his highest season's aggregate) at 32.21. The following year he picked up another 24 wickets, and achieved a career-best 5\u201324 against YorkshireFrom 1927 and 1929, Jagger turned out for Wales, at that point playing a small number of first-class games each year, and played in the side's eight-wicket win over the touring West Indians. The game was dominated by 55-year-old Sydney Barnes' 12 wickets, and the wicketless Jagger's personal contribution was limited to a first-innings 30.\nJagger played a little minor counties cricket for Denbighshire in 1930, but in 1931 returned for his final fling at first-class level, appearing three times without conspicuous success for Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Baines", "response": ["Eight years after the conclusion of the war, Baines made an appearance in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Fenner's.
