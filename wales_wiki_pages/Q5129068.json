He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace seam bowler.\nWarner played his club cricket for Carmarthenshire, his most notable in 1920 against future team Glamorgan, for whom he was only called up in just a single first-class match, during the 1923 County Championship season. However, Glamorgan lost by an innings margin, and Warner, aged 41 by this time, was never called up again to the Glamorgan side.\nBy trade, Warner was a stockbroker, and took up cricket in his spare time, playing at club level either side of the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1965 in Wales", "response": ["*29 December \u2013 Claude Warner, cricketer, 83"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Claude Warner (1923) : C.
