Roberts and Matthews hired a drummer, Stephen \"Frog\" Jenkins from the band U Thant, and continued to record bilingual Welsh/English tracks. The band began to play live, with Matthews and Roberts busking to support their income. They were spotted by the girlfriend of the lead singer of the band The Pooh Sticks, who thought that Matthews would make a good female voice for the group.

They soon settled on a line-up consisting of Rhys on vocals and guitar, Ieuan on drums, his brother Cian Ciaran (formerly of WWZZ) on keyboards, Huw Bunford (formerly of U-Thant) on guitar and Guto Pryce on bass.

Recording largely took place at AV Happenings during the second half of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band \"didn't really know what [they] were doing\". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: \"we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to figure out why. So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best\". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as \"ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine\". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more \"straight ahead\" tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and \"messed around\" with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.", "After the more produced Rings Around the World, which relied heavily on computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power \"a little more human\" with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: \"with technology you can do anything these days, but sometimes less is more\". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded \"pretty good right from the start\" which also contributed to the decision to avoid \"over-tweak[ing] them in the studio\". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of \"sound effect and light music\" vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: \"he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: \"hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?\" And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room\".", "*Guto Pryce \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Fuzzy Logic (Super Furry Animals album)", "response": ["*Guto Pryce \u2013 bass, Hammond, vocals, claps, analogues"]}, {"page": "Rings Around the World", "response": ["*Guto Pryce \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Guerrilla (album)", "response": ["The Super Furry Animals had originally intended to work on the album with Gorwel Owen, who co-produced 1996's Fuzzy Logic and 1997's Radiator with the band. According to Rhys, however, Owen felt \"burned out\" after producing other bands solidly for a year and a half and asked the group to wait until he had chance to rest. The Super Furry Animals were so keen to record that they decided to produce the album themselves. Guerrilla was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire during the middle of 1998. Although Rhys has stated that the group met Gabriel several times during recording, and that they thought he was \"a good old guy\", Real World was chosen because it was near to the band's homes in Wales rather than because of its association with the former Genesis frontman. Sessions were \"much less volatile than usual\" according to Rhys, as the five members of the band felt they had to reach consensus over everything because they were producing the record themselves\u2014while recording their previous albums the band would often fall out and shout at each other safe in the knowledge that Owen would act as a mediator and take the final decisions. Bassist Guto Pryce has stated that the band also felt happier during recording sessions for Guerrilla because they had their pets with them at Real World, and were able to relax and enjoy the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the British summer.", "During recording, the band used a sampler for the first time and hired many different musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing \"the music to dictate itself\". The song \"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\" was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. \"Some Things Come from Nothing\" came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was \"written and recorded simultaneously\" by the group. \"The Sound of Life Today\" is a 22-second sample of \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" played backwards \u2013 an accident that occurred when mixing engineer Chris Shaw rewound the mix and forgot to mute the tape machine . According to Rhys the band gave the track a \"really pompous title\" so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a \"collection of noises\". \"Do or Die\", \"Fire in My Heart\" and \"Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy\" were written by Rhys while \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for \"Northern Lites\" was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments \"lying around\" Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.", "*Guto Pryce \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Phantom Phorce", "response": ["The remixes are interspersed with anecdotes from 'Kurt Stern' (actually the band's road manager) who supposedly made the decision to make these remixes after being unhappy with the original Phantom Power.

Rhys has said that, although keyboardist Cian Ciaran did not explore \"digital frontiers\" on the album, he was still able to \"deconstruct songs\", even when playing the harmonium. The band had previously thought of the saxophone as \"the instrument of Satan\", but actually used one on this record for the first time, reasoning that it was appropriate as Mwng is a \"darkish album\".

This point was echoed by Guto Pryce in an interview with Birmingham's Metro although he conceded that \"in Rio music is everywhere.
