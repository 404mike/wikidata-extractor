In a time before regulated championship titles, St. John used the press to proclaim himself as heavyweight champion of Wales after beating John O'Brien, a fighter he spent his early career building a rivalry against. Despite a high-profile defeat to O'Brien in 1894, St. John continued to fight, but a disastrous contest in which as a cornerman a boxer died at an unsanctioned match saw his career put in jeopardy. A successful period as a sparring partner for Australian champion Peter Jackson revived his career. After joining the British Army, he was posted to South Africa where he fought in the Second Boer World and died in heroic circumstances at the Battle of Belmont.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Jones", "response": ["* David Jones, birth name of Dai St. John (1879\u20131899), Welsh heavyweight boxer"]}, {"page": "1899 in Wales", "response": ["*23 November \u2013 Dai St. John, heavyweight boxer, 28"]}, {"page": "1871 in Wales", "response": ["*1 April - Dai St. John, heavyweight boxer (died 1899)"]}, {"page": "St John (name)", "response": ["*Dai St. John, Welsh heavyweight boxer"]}, {"page": "Boxing in Wales", "response": ["In 1867, Wales made its first major contribution to boxing, when Llanelli-born sportsman and sport organiser John Graham Chambers devised and drafted the Queensbury Rules,Davies (2008), pg 135. the basic code to which boxing still practices under to this day. Although boxing now had its legitimate code of laws, Wales would often be the location of illegal bare-knuckled fights, and there would be known mountainside locations where locals would meet to watch fights.Stead; Williams (2008) p.7 These illegal fights were often conducted at dawn in isolated or remote areas, though they were still sometimes disrupted by the law. To evade criminal proceedings, fights were often arranged on land near county borders where jurisdiction was vague and law enforcement intermittent.Stead; Williams (2008) p.10 In particular the area between Tafarnaubach near Tredegar and Llangynidr in Powys became the 'nursery for would-be champions' due to its proximity to the borders of three counties. Towards the end of the Victorian period several Welsh boxers, who made their name as mountain fighters, began fighting under Queensbury rules and became well known and respected sportsmen. Among their number were champion fighters, John O'Brien, Dai St. John, Redmond Coleman and butcher brothers Sam and Ivor Thomas. By the early 20th century, boxing had not advanced to a great degree in Wales, and many of the country's early professional boxers began their career fighting in booths at fairgrounds. With the popularity of the sport increasing, a scale of weights and titles evolved, which allowed the emergence of working-class local heroes."]}]}}
