Harry Longueville JonesLongueville Jones took his name from inheriting the Longueville estates in Shropshire.  Sir Ben Bowen Thomas \"Arch Camb\" 127, apparently erroneously says that his mother came from the French Longueville family, which seems most unlikely as her maiden name was Stephen who was supported by the celticist the Rev John Williams. Rather than form a society directly, Longueville Jones produced a 'manifesto' -On the study and preservation of national antiquities- calling on interested people to join together and form an association.Archaeologia Cambrensis, vol 1. Longueville Jones at this date was living at Beaumaris in Anglesey.  Between 1834 and 1842 he lived in Paris, where he worked for the English language publisher Galignani and edited several editions of Galignani's Paris Guide.  He worked with leading literary figures including William Thackeray. The ideas he put forward owed much to current developments in France, which followed the appointment in 1834 of the French novelist Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e as the first Inspector-General of Monuments Historiques.Andr\u00e9 Fermigier, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e et l'inspection des monuments historiques, dans Pierre Nora (dir.), Les lieux de m\u00e9moire, vol. 1, Paris: Gallimard Quarto, 1997, p. 1599-1614. Longueville was also a talented artist and his work was used to illustrate early volumes of Archaeologia Cambrensis.", "In the 1850s a schism developed among the membership of the Cambrians. John Williams, who had been to Jesus College, Oxford, and whose sympathies lay with the Tractarians (or Oxford Movement), belonged to an older school of celticism, which wished to promote the authenticity of the writings of Iolo Morganwg. Williams did not fit in with the members of the association, whose primary interests were in Welsh architecture and archaeology. The association was also in a poor state financially as there had been a failure to collect subscriptions. Williams resigned as general secretary and Editor late in 1853Archaeologia Cambrensis, vol. 5, 1854, p. 71 and he was followed by other joint secretary the Rev Basil Jones who resigned at the Summer Meeting at Ruthin. The published list of members now shows that membership had shrunk to 163. Williams, following his resignation created an alternative society, the Cambrian Institute, publishers of the Cambrian Journal, which Williams edited until his death in 1863, when the Institute faded away.Lloyd, p. 14.", "* 1906 Carmarthen: Sir John Williams 1st Baronet "]}, {"page": "Archaeologia Cambrensis", "response": ["*Harry Longueville Jones and John Williams (Ab Ithel) (joint secretaries, 1846\u20139)", "*Basil Jones and John Williams (Ab Ithel) (joint secretaries, 1849\u201353)"]}, {"page": "John Hugh Jones", "response": ["Jones was born in May, 1843, in Bala, Gwynedd, north Wales.

This was intended to provide funding for a new Diocese of Manchester. It was in the course of this campaign that Longueville Jones met the Rev. John Williams (Ab Ithel) and realising their kindred interests in Welsh history, literature and antiquity, led to their production, in January 1846, of the first number of the periodical which they entitled Archaeologia Cambrensis. The publication led to the expression of a desire for the establishment of an association to study Welsh archaeology. Longueville-Jones accordingly organised a meeting at Aberystwith in September 1847, and the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Association was then founded. He resigned as editor in 1849 on his appointment as Inspector for National Schools in Wales. Jones resumed as editor of '\u2019Archaeologia Cambrensis'\u2019 in 1855 and continued until his death in 1875.
