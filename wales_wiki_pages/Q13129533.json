He was from the Hirwaun area of Aberdare, Glamorgan (now Rhondda Cynon Taf), where his father worked as a refiner at Crawshay Ironworks.

When he returned to Hirwaun, he took up the position of headmaster of the local school (from 1884 to 1886), and he then became headmaster of Cymmer School in the Afan Valley, remaining there until he retired in 1926.\nHis writings include contributions to a number of local and national newspapers in South Wales, including to Y Brython under the pseudonym \"Eryr Craig y Llyn\", the Radnorshire volume in Cambridge University Press's \"County Series\" (1912), Outlines of the History of the Afan Districts (1914), Ystor\u00efau Siluria (1921), Bargodion Hanes (1924), four adventure novels (Daff Owen, Lewsyn yr Heliwr, Y Geilwad Bach and Wat Emwnt) and also musical compositions such as the hymn-tune \"Cymer\". \nHe died in May 1951 and was buried in Cymer Afan Cemetery.
