Jacklin cited the failure to secure a sponsor for the event, and the fact that only 15% of tickets had been sold. The reduction in the prize fund and the failure to confirm the reduced amounts that players would receive was criticised by a number of players. In protest at the reduced prize money on offer, Fallon Sherrock, runner-up in the 2015 women's event, confirmed that she would be withdrawing from the competition. Ultimately, champion Wayne Warren received \u00a323,000, a 77% reduction on the previous year's prize money and the lowest amount received by a winner of the tournament since 1989.
