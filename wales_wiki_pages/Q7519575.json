While Spin gave a figurative description of the record as \"the work of a man cautiously opening the bedroom door and reeling from the discovery that other people have lives.\" Other themes the album explores are solitude, paranoia and self-loathing. On the darker side the album depicts tragedy, failed relationships and doomed romances; however, within this dark setting, Anderson allowed positive statements of ambition and social mobility, reflected in \"The Power\".

John Harris of Select said the album plays like \"a retelling of the entire Suede movie script\" and is \"truly as good as most Greatest Hits albums.\" Writing for Vox, Simon Price felt that Anderson wrote some of his funniest lyrics on CD2, on the tracks \"Young Men\" and \"Jumble Sale Mums\". Aside from \"Duchess\", which he called \"lazy rubbish,\" he had strong praise for both discs.", "Keith Phipps of The A.V.

Independent critic Simon Price hailed it as \"the greatest B-sides album ever made.\" Kevin Courtney of The Irish Times expressed similar views of the album's quality, while admitting that only The Smiths' Hatful Of Hollow could supersede it.

He also added that it \"sports a slinky, subtle groove that recalls the maturity of Stevie Wonder\u2019s early-\u201970s heyday.\" A writer from the Gavin Report commented, \"Strictly a lyrical record in which Prince speaks of the priceless and the invaluable as well as the here-today and the gone-tomorrow. An easy going, if not carefree musical treat.\" Simon Price from The Guardian picked the song as a \"highlight\" from the album, describing it as \"thoughtfully mature\". Another editor, Alexis Petridis said it is \"a fantastic song, the smoothness of its sound and delivery masking a punchy, politically engaged lyric that takes in both consumerism and Operation Desert Storm.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that after a ballad, \"Diamonds And Pearls\", \"his royal badness speeds up the tempo just a little bit, for a nicely floating and immediately catchy number.\" Tom Doyle from Smash Hits stated that it is \"the best song\" on the LP, and \"the best tune he's done for years.\" He added that here, Prince \"gets into a laidback groove\"."]}, {"page": "Did It Again (Kylie Minogue song)", "response": ["The video received positive reviews, and won the Australian Video entry at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Erika Brooks Adickman from Idolator said that \"the tongue-in-cheek video had the pop icon acknowledging all the ways she had reinvented herself over the years\". American website BuzzFeed hosted a poll for online viewers to vote their best Kylie in the \"Did It Again\" video. As a result, Indie Kylie won with 36% (2,926 votes), Cute Kylie came second with 26% (2,083 votes), Dance Kylie came third with 20% (1,628 votes), and Sex Kylie came fourth with 18% (1,510 votes). During an interview Minogue gave to Jetstar Airways magazine, journalist Simon Price stated that the four different Kylies were \"brilliantly\" satirised in the video."]}, {"page": "D. I. Go Pop", "response": ["The band began work on their second studio album concurrently with some of the band's later EPs in 1993. However, despite the critical success of the band's EPs, the band had not been commercially successful. A journalist at The Quietus recalled that \"the sparse tiny-numbered disconnection of DI's audience, the rarity of finding anyone else who understood just how great they were, became disheartening,\" despite the praises of the band written by David Stubbs, Taylor Parkes, Lucy Cage, Jon Selzer and Simon Price in the British music press. Crause recalled, \"I remember our manager once telling us we had enough good reviews to wallpaper our houses with but we needed to pay our bills. It did start to become apparent in the last year or so that the reviews, especially in Melody Maker, counted for absolutely nothing in sales terms, which I belatedly came to realise were the be all and end all of being in a band if we needed to survive.\""]}, {"page": "Zoot Woman", "response": ["With the release of the conceptual debut album Living in A Magazine in 2001, Zoot Woman established themselves on the music scene, releasing the singles \"It's Automatic\" and \"Living in a Magazine\". The album's pop sensibility is evident on tracks such as \"Jessie\", \"Holiday Home\" and \"Information First\". Simon Price of The Independent wrote, \"This is the sound of minor-key heartbreak in departure lounges and penthouse suites, an album which should come with \"New York, London, Paris, Munich\" embossed on the sleeve.\""]}, {"page": "Sign o' the Times", "response": ["In the decades that followed, Sign o' the Times has been regarded by critics as Prince's best album. According to journalist Kristen Pyszczyk, \"critics tend to be pretty evenly divided over Prince\u2019s best album: about half will go for Purple Rain, and the rest usually vouch for Sign o' the Times, a double album sometimes regarded as Prince's magnum opus.\" In a retrospective review, John McKie of BBC News cited it as \"one of the most acclaimed albums of the second half of the 20th century\" and a \"masterpiece - encompassing all of [Prince's] musical personas: bedroom balladeer; penitent Christian; one-track-mind loverman; modern-day Basie-style bandleader; whimsical storyteller; meticulous orchestrator, guitar-wielding axeman and pop craftsman.\" Simon Price deemed it Prince's best album, as did Michaelangelo Matos, who wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that it was \"the most complete example of his artistry's breadth, and arguably the finest album of the 1980s\". Matos also believed it was \"the last classic R&B album prior to hip hop's takeover of black music and the final four-sided blockbuster of the vinyl era\"."]}, {"page": "Luxembourg (band)", "response": ["Their debut single, \"What The Housewives Don't Tell You\", was released in September 2004 to rave reviews from Teletext's Planet Sound  and others.  A compilation, Best Kept Secret, featuring tracks from the now deleted demo EPs alongside live recordings and electro reworkings, was released in December 2004. The album (described as \"Not Our Debut Album\" on the CD artwork) received 3.5 out of 5 from Simon Price in the Independent On Sunday."]}, {"page": "Blowback (album)", "response": ["Blowback received generally positive reviews from critics, although many of Tricky's longtime fans disliked it. According to Encyclopedia of Popular Music writer Colin Larkin, it was hailed as Tricky's best record since his 1995 debut Maxinquaye, while PopMatters critic Jeffrey Thiessen later called it \"a great pop album nobody liked\". Simon Price regarded Blowback as Tricky's best album since 1996's Pre-Millennium Tension and \"his most accessible since Maxinquaye.\" He wrote in his review for The Independent at the time that the artist's move to New York \"away from the petty politics of the music business\" had resulted in \"a dark, dense album of future-funk and deep dub\". In The New York Times, Neil Strauss called it a radical departure from previous Tricky records, \"direct and upfront, the poppiest production Tricky has ever mustered\". The Indianapolis Star described it as Tricky's attempt to \"prove there's at least one more rap-rock album that's worth a listen\". Writing for The Guardian, Dave Simpson was surprised by how \"deliriously uplifting, even humorous\", the music was, while encompassing \"everything from rap-metal (of which there's lots...) to ragga, US power-pop, granite beats, supernatural ambience and even New Romantic. At the same time, it is uniquely, inimitably Tricky.\""]}]}}
