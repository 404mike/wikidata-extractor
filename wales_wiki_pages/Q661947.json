His name is traditionally associated with the parish of Mallwyd, Gwynedd, where he was rector from 1604 until his death in 1644.\nHe is believed to have been the main editor and reviser of the 1620 edition of the Welsh translation of the Bible and the 1621 edition of the Welsh translation of the Book of Common Prayer.\nHe published a Welsh grammar in Latin in 1621, Antiquae linguae Britannicae ..., and a Welsh\u2013Latin Latin\u2013Welsh dictionary in 1632, Antiquae linguae Britannicae ... et linguae Latinae dictionarium duplex.

At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island.Davies (2008) pp. 647\u2013648 By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about  lower than today. Davies (1994) p. 17 The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.Davies (1994) pp. 4\u20136", "By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed and Seisyllwg, Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states. Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles.Davies (1994) pp. 56 John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill, attributed to Arthur by Nennius.", "From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to 's ( 844\u201377) inheritance of  and .

For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\"Davies (1994) p. 100 Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title  (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains, according to John Davies.Davies (1994) p. 128", "\"Wenglish\" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to historian John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\".Davies (1994) p. 623 Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0 per cent of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8 per cent returned in the 2001 census. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.Davies (2008) p. 940", "Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits.Davies (2008) p. 465 Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh. From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers.Davies (2008) p. 466 The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic."]}, {"page": "Mabinogion", "response": ["The first modern publications were English translations by William Owen Pughe of several tales in journals in 1795, 1821, and 1829.1.
