He causes a disruption and when the manager threatens to phone the police he tells him to do so before stapling him in the hand. Nathan is given community service for this disruption. While on his first day of community service, Nathan is caught in a storm. He appears unaffected, unlike those he is doing community service with. Nathan's mother, Louise (Michelle Fairley), kicks him out of his house for his behaviour towards his step-father, Jeremy (Jo Stone-Fewings). Nathan begins living in the community centre. The group kill Tony (Danny Sapani/Louis Decosta Johnson), as an act of self-defense, and bury him. Nathan sleeps with Ruth (Amy Beth Hayes/Clare Welch) who he discovers has been affected by the storm and is really 82 years old. In an alternate timeline, the group are killed because Curtis Donovan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) used his power of time travel to change the events, preventing him from ending up in community service; Nathan, however, survives and is told that when found by paramedics he was almost dead. Rachel (Jessica Brown Findlay) begins manipulating people into behaving how she wants through her power of suggestion. Nathan kidnaps Rachel using a gun and takes her to the roof of the community centre. She can't or won't revert those back to their original state and she realises Nathan's gun is only a water pistol. She and Nathan brawl before both falling to their deaths. After Nathan's funeral he wakes up in his coffin, realising he is immortal."]}, {"page": "Lilyhammer", "response": ["* Amy Beth Hayes (season 2)"]}, {"page": "Mr Selfridge", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Amy Beth Hayes"]}, {"page": "Case Sensitive (TV series)", "response": ["The first series focuses on DS Charlie Zailer (Olivia Williams) and DC Simon Waterhouse (Darren Boyd) as they investigate the double murder of a mother and their five-year-old child.
