He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler.\nBorn in St Asaph, Clwyd, Owen attended Prestatyn High School and began his cricket career playing for Prestatyn Cricket Club. He was soon spotted by the Glamorgan scouts and began playing for their second XI in 2006. In 2007, he made his debut for Wales Minor Counties and at the end of the season, he made his first-class debut for Glamorgan, playing in their final County Championship match of the season against Gloucestershire.\nThat year, Owen began a degree course at UWIC in Cardiff, and therefore divided his time in the 2008 season between playing for the Cardiff University Centre of Cricketing Excellence, the Glamorgan 2nd XI, Wales Minor Counties, Pentyrch and Prestatyn. The 2009 season saw him continue to turn out for Wales Minor Counties and the Glamorgan 2nd XI, but he played his club cricket for Abergavenny.\nIn 2010, Owen returned to the Glamorgan 1st XI, almost three years after his debut. He made his return in a Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Unicorns at Dean Park, Bournemouth, on 16 May 2010, taking five wickets for 39 runs, and then scoring 12 runs off 12 balls; however, Glamorgan lost by 58 runs. The following week, he returned to first-class cricket with a County Championship match away to Leicestershire, and although he took no wickets and made no runs, Glamorgan won by 10 wickets. His Twenty20 debut came on 11 June, in Glamorgan's third match of the 2010 Friends Provident t20 away to the Essex Eagles; his bowling conceded 36 runs in two overs, but he did not bat as Glamorgan won by 7 wickets.\nHe was forced to retire from professional cricket in August 2015 as a result of long-term back and hip injuries. However, he made a comeback in the 2016 season, signing for Cheshire and Chester Boughton Hall.", "link_mentions": {}}}
