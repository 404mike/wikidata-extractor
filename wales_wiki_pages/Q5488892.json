In quite sharp tone, Parkin argued that Marxist theories of social class were marked by fundamental deficiencies, particularly associated with the ambiguous status of their central explanatory concept, mode of production. He attacks the Marxists' overemphasis on deep levels of structure, at the expense of social actors, and suggests a radical recasting of the theory of class and stratification. He proposes to do this by centering theory around the concept of social closure. Parkin follows Weber in understanding closure as:Parkin goes on to elaborate this concept, by identifying two main types, exclusionary  and usurpationary closure. 'The distinguishing feature of exclusionary closure is the attempt by one group to secure for itself a privileged position at the expense of some other group through processes of subordination'. He refers to this metaphorically as the use of power downwards. Usurpationary closure, however, is the use of power upwards, by the groups of subordinates created by the exclusionary closure, aimed at winning a greater share of resources, threatening 'to bite into the privileges of legally defined superiors'.

About three-quarters were Labour votersFrank Parkin, Middle Class Radicalism: The Social Bases of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Manchester University Press, 1968, p. 39. and many of the early executive committee were Labour Party members. The ethos of CND at that time was described as \"essentially that of middle-class radicalism\".", "In the event, Labour lost the 1959 election, but it voted at its 1960 Conference for unilateral nuclear disarmament, which represented CND's greatest influence and coincided with the highest level of public support for its programme.April Carter, Direct Action and Liberal Democracy, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973, p. 64.  The resolution was passed against the wishes of the party's leaders and Hugh Gaitskell promised to \"fight, fight, and fight again\" against the decision. The Campaign for Democratic Socialism was formed to organise in the constituencies and trades unions to have it overturned at the next conference, S.E.Finer, Anonymous Empire, London: Pall Mall Press, 1966, p.17 which duly occurred.Robert McKenzie, \"Power in the Labour Party: The Issue of 'Intra-Party Democracy'\", in Dennis Kavanagh, The Politics of the Labour Party, Routledge, 2013. Labour's failure to win the election and its rejection of unilateralism in 1961 upset CND's plans. From that date its prospects of success began to fade and it was said that it lacked any clear idea of how nuclear disarmament was to be implemented and that its demonstrations had become ends in themselves. The sociologist Frank Parkin said that, for many supporters, the question of implementation was of secondary importance anyway because, for them, involvement in the campaign was \"an expressive activity in which the defence of principles was felt to have higher priority than 'getting things done'.\" He suggested CND's survival in the face of its failure was explained by the fact that it provided \"a rallying point and symbol for radicals\", which was more important for them than \"its manifest function of attempting to change the government's nuclear weapons policy.\"  Despite setbacks, it retained the support of a significant minority of the population and became a mass movement, with a network of autonomous branches and specialist groups and an increased participation in demonstrations until about 1963."]}]}}
