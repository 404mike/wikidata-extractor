Jones is chiefly remembered for his defence of women following the damning insinuations made in the Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of education in Wales, more commonly known as the Treachery of the Blue Books. He edited several papers in London and in Wales but it his work on Y Gymraes (The Welshwoman), which has made him of particular interest to Welsh historians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Treachery of the Blue Books", "response": ["The report's publication resulted in a furious reaction in Wales which lasted for years. The clerics of the Established Church were considered as internal enemies. Staunch Anglicans refuted the report, next came the satirical attacks and statistically-based analytical challenge of the facts from Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), a Nonconformist journalist. ", "Saunders Lewis, in his The Fate of the Language (Tynged yr Iaith) BBC address, maintained that the Blue Books were for Welsh history \"the most important nineteenth-century historical documents we possess\" as their effect was to turn Wales into a more bilingual country, through the requirement to learn English as a second language. Such a judgement also reflects the fact that the publication of the reports, and the controversy that followed, was the catalyst for a much greater level of nonconformist involvement in the politics of Wales than hitherto. Critics such as Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog), Henry Richard, Thomas Price and Sir Thomas Phillips gained wide publicity for their trenchant criticisms of the reports. Over time these criticisms evolved into an organised political action, which culminated at the general election of 1868."]}, {"page": "1850s in Wales", "response": ["**23 February \u2014 Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), minister and journalist, 31"]}, {"page": "1852 in Wales", "response": ["*23 February \u2013 Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), minister and journalist, 31"]}, {"page": "1820 in Wales", "response": ["*5 September \u2013 Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd), minister and journalist (d. 1852)"]}, {"page": "Evan Jones", "response": ["Evan Jones may refer to:", "*Evan Jones (Australian poet) (born 1931), Australian poet and professor", "*Evan Jones (Canadian poet) (born 1973), Canadian poet and critic", "*Evan Jones (Welsh poet), see 1892 in Wales", "*Evan Jones (cricketer) (born 1996), South African cricketer", "*Evan Jones (footballer) (1888\u2013?), Welsh international footballer", "*Evan Jones (Canadian football) from 1978 CFL Draft", "*Evan Jones (pirate) (fl. 1698\u20131699), pirate captain active near Madagascar and the African coast", "*Evan Jones (missionary) (1820\u20131872), Baptist missionary to the Cherokees and leader of one group on the Trail of Tears", "*Evan Jones (Stitch Media), Canadian interactive producer ", "*Evan Jones (Farmers Alliance) (1846\u20131899), President of the Texas Farmers Alliance", "*Evan Jones (Blue Heelers), fictional character from the Australian TV series Blue Heelers", "*Evan Jones (writer) (born 1927), Anglo-Caribbean writer", "*Evan Jones (actor) (born 1976), American actor", "*Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd) (1820\u20131852), Welsh campaigner and journalist", "*Evan Jones (Gurnos), see 1871 in Wales", "*Evan Jones (Calvinistic Methodist), see Henry Edwards (priest)", "*Evan Jones (Ifan y Gorlan), harpist, died in 1859 in Wales", "*Evan Jones (author) for Rivers of America Series", "*Evan Jones (rapper), American rapper from Miami, Florida", "*Evan Jones (musician), Australian musician"]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage in Wales", "response": ["One of the first periodicals to launch after the publication, and in direct response to, the 'Blue Books' was Y Gymraes (The Welshwoman). Its editor Evan Jones (1820-1852) known by his bardic name of \"Ieaun Gwynedd\" was seen as a champion of Welsh women following his detailed defence of their morality following the controversy surrounding the Report. Y Gymraes, launched in January 1850, set out to create the 'perfect' Welshwoman, a virtue of morality, sobriety and thrift, a beacon that would see the Welsh nation above all future criticism. As early as the autumn of 1851, with the health of its editor failing, Y Gymraes was merged with the monthly penny periodical Y Tywysydd (The Guide), and became Y Tywysydd a'r Gymraes in early 1852. Despite its title the majority of the contributors were men, and the publication continued to emphasise the importance of high moral standards rather than give practical advice. Although the publication continued into the 1880s, it eventually made way for Y Frythones (The Female Briton) under the editorship of Sarah Jane Rees. Although these periodicals had their roots in the temperance movement, and many of the articles within their pages were frivolous, by the 1880s they began broaching the topic of female emancipation."]}, {"page": "Elen Egryn", "response": ["Also in 1850, in reaction to the publication of the Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of education in Wales which severely criticized the loose morals and behaviour of Welsh women, Evan Jones (1820\u20131852) published Y Gymraes (The Welsh Women) which set out to defend the high principles of Welsh women.
