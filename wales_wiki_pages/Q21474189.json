Ill discipline cost the Valley Cougars who at one point were down to ten men. By the half hour the Outlaws were 18-0 up thanks to tries by John Christie, Jimmy Goodwin and Adrian Chaima all scored a goal by Dan Smith but the holders hit back with two tries in the final five minutes through Craig Lewis and Mike Hurley the first converted by Ben Jones leaving the score 18-10 at half time. At the start of the second half the first Valley Cougars sin binning cost them an immediate try from George Strachan, again scored a goal by Smith. A second sin binning soon after led again to an immediate try for the Outlaws this time from Goodwin, his second try of the match, Smith on this occasion missing his first conversion to leave the score at 28-10. Amazingly while down to 10 men following another sin binning, player coach Dafydd Hellard scored and with a conversion from Marcus Webb the Valley Cougars reduced the arrears to 12 points. But the lack of numbers eventually made the difference as Nottingham scored two more tries through Chaima, his second, and Adam Cunliffe.
