After toying with the names Dolphin Logic and Friendly Rifles, they were joined by visual artist Gareth Williams, brought on due to his lack of formal musical training, and the trio settled upon This Heat in reference to the 1976 British Isles heat wave, regarded at the time as the hottest summer on record. The band also offered to recruit Bill McCormick, but this fell through due to personality clashes with Williams.

They began to experiment with tape loops, found sounds and keyboards on several sessions (recorded from 1976 to 1978, but not released until 1979). Finally, in 1979, This Heat released their self-titled debut album.  1981's Deceit marked the final new album from This Heat, Williams leaving just after its release. While Bullen began working as a studio engineer, Hayward did sessions for Lora Logic, The Raincoats and Everything but the Girl before forming Camberwell Now with bassist Trefor Goronwy and tape manipulator Stephen Rickard.

Andy Kellman of Allmusic found the first session to contain \"more gripping material. Charles Bullen's Twilight Zone theme guitar pluckings, circular ringing figures, distorted blasts, and fusion-y leads on \"Horizontal Hold\" are crystal clear, as are the frantic keyboards and organs from Gareth Williams and/or Charles Hayward.\" The second session \"features the thrashy, jagged, off-kilter rhythms of \"Rimp Romp Ramp,\" foreshadowing the more aggressive, disjointed sides of the Fall, Long Fin Killie, and Painkiller. \"Makeshift\"'s stream-of-consciousness blasts are neuron frying; the vocals sound like a high-pitched Brian Eno gone bananas.\" He criticized the closing 3 tracks as \"patience-testing snippets based on freeform clarinet, piano, and noise.\" Pitchfork's Robert Ham writes that the album \"reveals just how clear their collective vision was from the start.\" Seb of Tiny Mix Tapes expressed disbelief at the fact that the songs were recorded in 1977, calling it \"literally timeless [...] Parallels could be drawn across the decades to the Velvet Underground\u2019s narcotic haze, Eno\u2019s billowy ambience, Albini\u2019s clawhammer guitar, and Tricky\u2019s dusty hip-hop dirges. But This Heat were more obtuse than any of the above. They jumped between genres, tempos, and instruments, more with nervous energy than schooled precision. Grindstone drones underline the songs like a bed of nails, prodding the vocals to convulse like Ian Curtis on helium. The sound is so tightly-wound it can only betray its paranoia.\" He called the album's version of \"Horizontal Hold\" as \"either the precursor to post-rock, or Krautrock with a junkie\u2019s itch\", \"The Fall of Saigon\" as \"one of the grimiest loops to ever grace tape\" and \"Makeshift\" as \"an angular epic that evokes King Crimson reborn with Public Image Ltd.\u2019s metallic lurch.\" He concluded the review by calling the album \"a genuinely unnerving experience \u2014 the ultimate in uneasy listening.\" Johnathan Dean of Brainwashed wrote that the Peel sessions \"combin[es] fantastically possessed renditions of tracks from the debut album with an amazing one-off heavy prog number (\"Rimp Romp Ramp\") and a handful of puzzling avant-jazz sketches that never really go anywhere, but I'd happily take This Heat's toss-offs over most band's finest hours.\" Louis Pattison of Uncut described the tracks \"Slither\" and \"Sitting\" as exploring \"an uneasy, claustrophobic improv of meandering tape loops and droning strings.\"", "All tracks composed by This Heat; performed by Charles Hayward, Charles Bullen and Gareth Williams.
