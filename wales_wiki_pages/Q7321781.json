He was his standard bearer and a leading general.  His name means \"swarthy Rhys\".\nLittle is known of his life.  He had a brother, Hywel Coetmor, who also played a significant role in the rising. It is claimed that they were the grandsons of an illegitimate son of Dafydd ap Gruffydd.\nHe took part in the crucial Welsh victory at the Battle of Bryn Glas in 1402.  He led an army which captured several castles in South Wales. He appears to have been killed at either the Battle of Pwll Melyn or the Battle of Grosmont in 1405.In the 20th century, his name was used as a pseudonym in statements by Meibion Glynd\u0175r.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caerleon", "response": ["During the Glynd\u0175r Rising in 1402 Rhys Gethin, General for Owain Glynd\u0175r, took Caerleon Castle together with those of Newport, Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly and Usk by force. This was probably the last time Caerleon castle was ruined, though the walls were still standing in 1537 and the castle ruins only finally collapsed in 1739 - their most obvious remnant is the Round Tower at the Hanbury Arms public house. The Tower is a Grade II* listed building."]}, {"page": "Newport, Wales", "response": ["During the Last War for Welsh Independence in 1402 Rhys Gethin, General for Owain Glynd\u0175r, forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly, Caerleon and Usk. During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed."]}, {"page": "Battle of Stalling Down", "response": ["The Welsh army included a French contingent assimilated into forces from Morgannwg led by Rhys Gethin ('swarthy Rhys') and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda commanding the contingent from the Rhondda Valleys region. Cadwgan had a home at Aberochwy, near what is today Treorchy. He fought using a battleaxe as his weapon of choice and was later known as Cadwgan of the Bloody Axe. Owain Glynd\u0175r is also reported to have been present in the battle in person."]}, {"page": "Meibion Glynd\u0175r", "response": ["Four separate movements claimed responsibility for the bombings: Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (\"the movement to defend Wales\"), Cadwyr Cymru (\"the keepers of Wales\"), Meibion Glynd\u0175r, and the Welsh Army for the Workers Republic (WAWR), whose attacks were on political targets in the early 1980s.  Meibion Glynd\u0175r was the only group to have any claim to long-term success, although since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive, and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased, at least on an organisational level. Letters claiming responsibility for attacks were signed \"Rhys Gethin\", in homage to one of Owain Glynd\u0175r's most prominent followers."]}, {"page": "Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r", "response": ["He is known to have taken part in a raid in south Wales in 1405, alongside his uncle Tudur ap Gruffudd, and another rebel Captain Rhys Gethin. They were defeated by Prince Henry of Monmouth, later to become King Henry V or possibly John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. The exact place and date of this battle is subject to dispute, but the Annals of Owain Glyndwr call it the Battle of Pwll Melyn, near Usk. The result appears to have been a major Welsh defeat, the capture of Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r, and the deaths of Tudur and Rhys Gethin."]}, {"page": "Grosmont, Monmouthshire", "response": ["Grosmont is linked to the Welsh Prince Owain Glynd\u0175r and during the Glyndwr rebellion it was the site of a battle in 1405. Glyndwr's ally and trusted Captain Rhys Gethin raised a force of maybe 8,000 men that marched on Grosmont burning the town to the ground. At this time Grosmont was a large and important settlement - only Abergavenny and Carmarthen were larger in the whole of South Wales. Prince Henry, later to become King Henry V, dispatched a force comprising men led by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, Sir William Newport and Sir John Greynder from Hereford to intercept the Welsh force. They fell on them and defeated the Welsh, killing 800 to 1,000 men and capturing Owen ap Gruffydd ap Rhisiant, Glyndwr's Secretary and John Hanmer, Glyndwr's brother in law, who both survived the battle but were imprisoned in the Tower of London."]}, {"page": "Battle of Pwll Melyn", "response": ["Casualties on the Welsh side were heavy; they lost 1500 men according to some sources, a large number considering their heavy recent losses at Grosmont. According to Adam of Usk three hundred prisoners were beheaded in front of Usk Castle following the battle. Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r was captured, while Owain's brother Tudur was slain in the field. The close family resemblance in Tudur's face briefly convinced some English that Owain himself had fallen. Another serious blow was the death of John ap Hywel, Abbot of the Llantarnam Cistercian monastery, a notable supporter of Glynd\u0175r who was killed during the battle as he ministered to the dying and wounded of both sides. Rhys Gethin may also have died here if he did not die in the earlier Battle of Grosmont."]}, {"page": "Gethin", "response": ["*Rhys Gethin (died 1405), Welsh supporter of rebel Owain Glyndwr"]}, {"page": "Glynd\u0175r Rising", "response": ["There were other signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early in the year Owain's forces suffered defeats at Grosmont and Usk at the Battle of Pwll Melyn. Although it is very difficult to understand what happened at these two battles, it appears that Henry of Monmouth or possibly Sir John Talbot defeated substantial Welsh raiding parties led by Rhys Gethin (\"Swarthy Rhys\") and Owain's eldest son, Gruffudd ab Owain Glynd\u0175r. The exact date and order of these battles is subject to dispute. However, they may have resulted in the death of Rhys Gethin at Grosmont and Owain's brother, Tudur, at Usk and the capture of Gruffudd. Gruffudd was sent to the Tower of London and after six years died in prison. King Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more ruthless tactics. Adam of Usk says that after the Battle of Pwll Melyn near Usk, King Henry had three hundred prisoners beheaded in front of Usk Castle. John ap Hywel, Abbot of the nearby Llantarnam Cistercian monastery, was killed during the Battle of Usk as he ministered to the dying and wounded on both sides. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland. Over the next year they would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406."]}, {"page": "Hywel Coetmor", "response": ["Hywel Coetmor was a Welsh knight who took part in Owain Glynd\u0175r's rising.  He had earlier fought under the Black Prince at the Battle of Poitiers (1356). His brother was Rhys Gethin, who was one of Glynd\u0175r's leading generals."]}]}}
