But when she had two small children, she started writing again, and eventually earned an MPhil in Writing at the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales), where her tutor was novelist and poet Christopher Meredith. The novel she wrote for the degree became The Mathematics of Love, which was sold to Headline Review, as the first of a two-book deal. Meanwhile, she had found the form of a research degree so fruitful that she completed a PhD in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths' College in 2010, where her supervisor was Maura Dooley.
