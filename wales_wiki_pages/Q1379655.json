He was the son of two farmers and attended a local primary school. After finishing primary school, Davies received a full ride scholarship to Llandysul County School in the neighbouring town of Llandysul. There he became friends with Evan James Williams, a future professor of physics at Aberystwyth University and member of the Royal Society. In 1921, he enrolled in Aberystwyth University. He would graduate with a Bachelor of Science with honours in the field of applied mathematics. After graduation he went to Swansea University where he studied pure mathematics and received his master's degree. Davies would move to Rome in August 1926 to study with the leading expert on absolute differential calculus, Tullio Levi-Civita. There he received his doctorate."]}]}}
