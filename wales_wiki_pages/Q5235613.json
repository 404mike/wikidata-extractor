He was educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, admitted to Gray's Inn on 5 November 1602 and called to the bar in 1609. In March 1643 he was appointed, against his will, as puisne judge of the Carmarthen circuit of the court of great sessions. He was a strong supporter of the Royalist cause in the civil war and, later that year, was involved in raising money for the siege of Gloucester. He indicted several prominent parliamentarians for high treason. Jenkins was captured by the parliamentarians in December 1645 in Hereford and imprisoned in the Tower of London, Newgate Prison and latterly in Wallingford and Windsor Castles. Whilst in prison in the 1640s, Jenkins wrote a number of political tracts which were collectively published in 1648 as: The Works of the Eminent and Learned Judge Jenkins upon divers Statutes concerning the King's Prerogative and the Liberty of the Subject.\nJenkins was brought before parliament in April 1647, but argued that it had no power to try him in the absence of the king. His arguments were expounded in his scholarly work, Lex Terrae which cited important authorities. The nub of his case, against the legitimacy of parliament in appointing justices and passing laws, was that such acts could only be performed with the explicit authority of the king and that the claim that the king was 'virtually' present in proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament was false.\nOn 22 February 1648, Jenkins was brought to the House of Commons to face charges including the writing of treasonous pamphlets. He refused to kneel at the bar of the house and was fined \u00a31000 for contempt. In 1650 Jenkins was amongst other prisoners that the Rump Parliament considered executing. He said that if he was to go to the scaffold he would be \"hanged with the Bible under one arm and Magna Carta under the other\".\nJenkins was eventually released in 1657 prior to the restoration of the monarchy. His estate at Hensol had been sequestered in 1652, but he regained it (estimated to be worth \u00a31500 p.a.) and lived there, becoming patron of the bards. He died in 1663 and was buried at Cowbridge. The obituary for Jenkins is apparently the first of its kind in the English-speaking world, published in The Newes on 17 December 1663 by Charles II's Surveyor of the Press, Roger L'Estrange.[1] Part of it read:\n\n\"... that Eminent, Loyall, and renowned Patriot, Judge Jenkins, Departed this Life at his House in Cowbridge, [at] 81..in perfect Sence and Memory. He dyed, as he lived, preaching with his last Breath to his Relations, and those who were about him, Loyalty to his Majesty, and Obedience to the Lawes of the Land. In fine, he has carried with him all the comforts of a Quiet Conscience, and left behind him an unspotted Fame...\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Jenkins", "response": ["David Jenkins may refer to:", "* David Jenkins (composer) (1848\u20131915), Welsh composer", "* David Jenkins (musician) (born 1947), singer for the band Pablo Cruise", "* David Jenkins (television writer), creator of People of Earth", "* David Jenkins, set designer", "* David Jenkins (North Carolina), 18th Century North Carolina politician", "* David Jenkins (Georgia politician), American politician from Georgia", "* David Jenkins (bishop) (1925\u20132016), of Durham", "* David Jenkins (Archdeacon of Westmorland and Furness) (1929\u20132014), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (archdeacon of Sudbury) (born 1961), Anglican priest", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1904) (1904\u20131951), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Wales", "* David Jenkins (rugby, born 1914) (1914\u20131979), rugby union and rugby league footballer for Cardiff ", "* David Jenkins (figure skater) (born 1936), American figure skater", "* David Jenkins (footballer) (born 1946), English footballer for Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur", "* David Jenkins (sprinter) (born 1952), Scottish athlete", "* David Jenkins (Olympic diving coach) (1989-2021), Team Great Britain Olympic diving coach", "* David Jenkins (Royalist) (1582\u20131663), Welsh judge and Royalist during the English Civil War", "* David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins (1899\u20131969), British Law Lord", "* David Jenkins (librarian) (1912\u20132002), Welsh librarian", "* David Jenkins (British Army officer), British Army major general", "* David Jenkins, journalist and editor of GameCentral"]}, {"page": "Court of Chancery", "response": ["Coke's challenge to the Chancery is seen by academic Duncan Kerly as helping him lose his position as a judge, and until its dissolution the Court of Chancery could overrule judgments issued in the common-law courts.

He was captured at either Hereford or Oxford in 1645 and sent to the Tower of London. On 21 February 1648 he was brought before the House of Commons but refused to kneel at the bar. He was therefore fined \u00a31,000 (equivalent to about \u00a3100,000 at 2009 values) for his contempt.

His Whig/anti-Catholic politics seem to have originated in resentment for the poor treatment his family received as Royalists during the English Civil War and Interregnum. (His father Sir Edward Thomas suffered financial hardship and become indebted, while his father-in-law Judge David Jenkins suffered physical and emotional hardship of being tried for sedition and imprisoned in the Tower of London for 7 years.) A second factor was rivalry between and within gentry families in Wales.  Many gentry families, including the Thomases, had Catholics in their extended family. These rivalries and conflicts formed along lines of religion, political power and intrigue, economic power, and personal dislikes. A third factor shaping his politics were friendships and alliances formed with prominent Whigs and anti-Catholics in Wales and in London, including John Arnold, Sir Trevor Williams, Ford, Lord Grey, and, later, Popish Plot conspirator Titus Oates. Though not on any published list, Robert Thomas was probably a member of the Green Ribbon Club. He became an ally (if not trusted friend) of the Whig leader Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury.  In Shaftesbury's  evaluation of allies and enemies (May 1677), he only rated Thomas as \"worthy\" rather than \"doubly worthy\" or \"thrice worthy\".K. H. D. Haley (1970), \"Shaftesbury's Lists of the Lay Peers and Members of the Commons, 1677-8\", Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, Vol. 43, No. 107, pp 86\u2013105. https://doi-org/10.1111/j.1468-2281.1970.tb01652.x  On top of these factors, Sir Robert's extremism was probably fueled by his dire financial condition in the 1670s and 1680s, i.e. such political actions could be used against enemies and to curry favor with powerful friends."]}, {"page": "David Morgan (Jacobite)", "response": ["Memories of figures such as Morgan and David Jenkins influenced later historians in assuming the rural Welsh gentry to have been ultra-royalists or \"fanatical tories\", even though this view was largely a \"myth\".Jenkins (2002) p.136 Morgan also attracted some interest from the Welsh \u201cCelticist\u201d nationalists of Cymru Fydd: in 1901 the magazine Young Wales published a poem by W.
