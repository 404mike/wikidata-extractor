In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 and 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the BBC to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as Petula Clark, Lita Roza, Anne Shelton, Frank Ifield, Ronnie Hilton and David Hughes were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for Craig Douglas, Karl Denver, Jackie Lee, Kenny Lynch, Vince Hill and Ricky Valance, but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself."]}, {"page": "Here in My Heart", "response": ["Prior to Martino's recording reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart, the song had already become a number one hit on the UK's sheet music sales chart.

Julien wrote the English lyrics to Cliff Richard's adaptation of \"L'Edera\", translating as \"Constantly\". It was a global hit, reaching the top ten in six countries.

I did write to them about possibly naming the by-pass \u2018Ariel Way\u2019 after the famous Bournbrook-based motorcycle manufactures, something I heard mooted on one of Carl Chinn\u2019s programmes, or possibly after Bournbrook\u2019s most famous son David Hughes (Geoffrey Paddison), the popular singer of the 1950s.  But no, what did they do \u2013 they named it Aston Webb Boulevard, after the London-born architect who helped designed the main building at the University, and in whose honour that was alredy named.  Seems like the by-pass not only physically by-passed Bournbrook, but also by-passed its history and heritage (mind I think they did name the aqueduct for the canal after Ariel \u2013 meaning you might suppose they built boats and not motorbikes!)."]}, {"page": "1948 in British music", "response": ["*10 March \u2013 Carissima, starring Ginger Rogers and David Hughes, opens at the Palace Theatre and runs for 488 performances."]}, {"page": "Summer Song (musical)", "response": ["#\"Be She Dark, Be She Fair\" \u2013 David Hughes (tenor)", "#\"No-One Told Me\" \u2013 David Hughes", "#\"Saturday Girl\" \u2013 David Hughes, Sally Ann Howes", "#\"Small Town Sweetheart\" \u2013 David Hughes", "#\"Finale\" \u2013 David Hughes, Sally Ann Howes"]}, {"page": "1925 in British music", "response": ["*11 October \u2013 David Hughes, operatic tenor (d. 1972)"]}]}}
