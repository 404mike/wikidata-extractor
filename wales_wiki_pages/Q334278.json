The Institute is unusual as the miners themselves built it, borrowing the money through a private mortgage. The Memo was built to commemorate the 75 Newbridge men who died in the First World War. It is still the focus of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday activities every year. The Memo contains a ballroom with a sprung dance floor and an art deco auditorium which was designed to be both a theatre and a cinema. Both buildings now provide community facilities for local groups and societies, live music and community events but are both in urgent need of repair. After the mines closed, the Institute & Memorial Hall lost its income and became a drinking club. In 2004, when the local council was considering purchasing the land for a car park, a public meeting called by local MP Don Touhig led to the formation of The Friends of Newbridge Memo who got the buildings onto the BBC2 programme Restoration. They narrowly missed winning the final but received assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund to begin the long process of raising money to restore both buildings. After a development grant was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in summer 2009, Cadw and Caerphilly County Borough Council are actively supporting the scheme and the Big Lottery awarded \u00a3500,000 in December 2009. In July 2010 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery would grant the project \u00a32.9 million to restore the buildings."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Islwyn || Don Touhig || Labour || Don Touhig || Labour"]}, {"page": "Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Don Touhig"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: T", "response": ["*Don Touhig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (2005\u20132010)", "response": ["*Don Touhig (Islwyn)", "*Don Touhig (Islwyn)"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Don Touhig, Islwyn, 1995\u20132010"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["* Don Touhig, Islwyn, 1995\u20132010"]}, {"page": "1995 in Wales", "response": ["*16 February - In the Islwyn by-election brought about by the resignation of Neil Kinnock, Don Touhig is elected as Labour MP for the constituency."]}, {"page": "1995 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 February \u2013 Neil Kinnock, former Leader of the Labour Party, resigns from Parliament after twenty-five years to take up a new role as a European Commissioner, sparking a by-election in his Islwyn constituency in South Wales.
