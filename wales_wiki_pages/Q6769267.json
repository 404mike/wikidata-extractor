He enjoyed a successful amateur career, representing Wales at all levels, and highlighted by winning the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1998. He turned professional later that year, immediately after winning a place on the European Tour at final qualifying school.\nPilkington had an unsuccessful rookie season on the European Tour in 1999, and played on the Challenge Tour the following season after failing to regain his card at qualifying school. He followed up a consistent Challenge Tour season with success at qualifying school to return to the top level for 2001. He managed to retain his European Tour card by finishing inside the top 100 on the Order of Merit in both 2001 and 2002, but his form dipped in 2003 and he dropped back down to the second tier for 2004.\nAfter two largely unsuccessful seasons on the Challenge Tour, Pilkington's fortunes were revived in 2006 when he produced consistently good performances to finish the season on top of the Challenge Tour Rankings. After a slow start to the season, he recorded back to back second-place finishes, before rounding off the season with victory in the Kazakhstan Open and another runners-up prize at the Apulia San Domenico Grand Final. By topping the money list, he had regained his card on the European Tour; but in 2007 he finished in 136th place on the Order of Merit to again lose his place on the elite tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Challenge Tour", "response": ["|2006 || Mark Pilkington ||  || align=right|\u20ac119,152"]}, {"page": "Adrien M\u00f6rk", "response": ["| Mark Pilkington,  Julien van Hauwe"]}, {"page": "2006 Open Championship", "response": [":Europe: Jamie Donaldson, Simon Dyson, Richard Green, Peter Hedblom, S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen, Barry Lane, Sam Little, Graeme McDowell, Louis Oosthuizen, Mark Pilkington, Phillip Price, Robert Rock, Carlos Rodiles, Marco Ruiz, Brett Rumford, Lee Slattery, Richard Sterne, Simon Wakefield"]}, {"page": "Challenge Tour Grand Final", "response": ["| 2006 ||  James Hepworth || align=center|271 || align=center|\u221213 || 2 strokes ||  Rafael Echenique Alex Nor\u00e9n Mark Pilkington || San Domenico Golf"]}, {"page": "\u00c1lvaro Quir\u00f3s", "response": ["| Mark Pilkington"]}, {"page": "Pilkington (surname)", "response": ["* Mark Pilkington (golfer) (born 1978), Welsh professional golfer", "* Mark Pilkington (writer) (born 1973), English writer"]}, {"page": "2006 Challenge Tour", "response": ["The Challenge Tour Rankings was won by Wales' Mark Pilkington.
