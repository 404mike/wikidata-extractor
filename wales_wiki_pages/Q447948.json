Morgan began to write on jazz from the early 1950 for Melody Maker, Jazz Journal, Jazz Monthly and Gramophone, and for 20 years from 1969 a weekly jazz column in a local Kent newspaper. Over his writing career he completed liner notes for over 2,500 albums, initially for Vogue Records. From 1954 he contributed to music programmes for BBC Radio.\nMorgan was the author of a book on modern jazz in England and the co-author of several books on jazz records. He lectured on jazz at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Royal Academy of Music in London. \nIn addition, until 1991 he was a full-time architect. Shortly after retiring from his other occupation, Morgan emigrated to Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eddie Costa", "response": ["Costa's overall style allowed him to play in a great variety of settings. According to critic Alun Morgan, \"his mind was never cluttered up with thoughts of stylistic divisions. He was at home with any jazz group, provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness\". On piano, his \"trademark sound\", remarked Ken Dryden, \"was the emphasis of the middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring the top two octaves\".Dryden, Ken. \"Eddie Costa: Biography\". AllMusic. Retrieved May 16, 2013. Some of Costa's more linear, right-hand playing was influenced by his listening to Bud Powell records while in the army. Costa's playing was more than just one-handed lines: during a period when the typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right-hand solos while adding only basic left-hand support, Costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound.Wilson, John S. (June 16, 1977) \"Records: Clavier to Jazz Piano\" The New York Times, p. 68. His piano playing on the informally recorded album Fuerst Set is typical of his style; it was later described by critic Whitney Balliett: Each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity, pattern of beats, and elements of surprise. Costa liked to use octave chords in the left hand and single-note lines in the right, and he liked to thunder endlessly down in the lower registers of the piano. At such times, he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect. He would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two-handed arpeggio, or he would deliver on-the-beat or offbeat chords \u2013 seesawing them, making them into sixty-fourth notes, somehow slurring them, and developing great drive and momentum.Balliett, Whitney (1981) Night Creature: A Journal of Jazz, 1975\u20131980, p. 15. Oxford University Press.", "On vibes, Costa's style was somewhat different. John S. Wilson commented in 1959 that \"In contrast to the stirring forays into the lower register that he is fond of making on piano, Costa's vibraphone style is light and dancing, closer to the Red Norvo manner than most current vibists.\" After Costa's death, Alun Morgan also compared his playing on the two instruments: \"As a vibraphonist Eddie carried over the pulsating elements of his piano style but also continued to employ a sensitive gradation of touch where necessary\".Morgan, Alun.
