Further references to difficulties with Warner Bros were included in \"I Am The Mob\", but they preferred working with producer TommyD on the production than they had with those on Way Beyond Blue. The first single off the album had intended to be \"Mulder and Scully\", but the label insisted that \"I Am the Mob\" was released instead. As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour. One example followed an incident at a party celebrating the victory of the yes vote in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, as when asked how she felt about the result, she responded \"What we want to know is who is going to shag Si\u00e2n Lloyd?\" Lloyd subsequently launched legal action, but accepted an apology from Matthews."]}, {"page": "Jesus College, Oxford", "response": ["The founders' hopes that their college would produce prominent Welsh clergy were fulfilled in no small measure when a former student, A.
