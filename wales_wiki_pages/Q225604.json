The owner of Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, Grosmont was a member of the House of Plantagenet, which was ruling over England at that time. He was the wealthiest and most powerful peer of the realm. \nThe son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, Grosmont became one of King Edward III's most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche. He was a founding member and the second Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created Duke of Lancaster. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book Livre de seyntz medicines, a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two guilds of the town in 1352.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 23", "response": ["*1361 \u2013 Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, English politician, Lord High Steward of England (b. 1310)"]}, {"page": "Wars of Scottish Independence", "response": ["*Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster"]}, {"page": "Henry IV of England", "response": ["Despite the example set by most of his recent predecessors, Henry and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England, were not buried at Westminster Abbey but at Canterbury Cathedral, on the north side of Trinity Chapel and directly adjacent to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. Becket's cult was then still thriving, as evidenced in the monastic accounts and in literary works such as The Canterbury Tales, and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyr saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimisation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from Richard II.Christopher Wilson, 'The Tomb of Henry IV and the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury', in Medieval Architecture and its Intellectual Context, ed. Eric Fernie and Paul Crossley (London: The Hambledon Press, 1990), pp. 181\u2013190.

Both shared a common descent from King Henry III. The wealth she brought to the marriage was the foundation of John's fortune. Blanche died on 12 September 1368 at Tutbury Castle, while her husband was overseas. Their son Henry Bolingbroke became Henry IV of England, having deposed King Richard II, who had seized the duchy of Lancaster upon John's death while Henry was in exile.

Edward III married all his sons to wealthy English heiresses rather than following his predecessors' practice of finding continental political marriages for royal princes. Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, had no male heir so Edward married his son John to Henry's heiress daughter and John's third cousin Blanche of Lancaster. This gave John the vast wealth of the House of Lancaster. Their son Henry usurped the throne in 1399, creating one of the factions in the Wars of the Roses. There was an intermittent dynastic struggle between the descendants of Edward III. In these wars, the term Lancastrian became a reference to members of the family and their supporters. The family provided England with three kings: Henry IV (r. 1399-1413), Henry V (r. 1413\u20131422), and Henry VI (r. 1422\u20131461 and 1470\u20131471).", "| Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Leicester|| 100px||1281Grosmont Castle, Monmouthshireson of Edmund Crouchback and Blanche of Artois||Matilda de Chaworth7 childrenHenry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of LancasterBlanche of Lancaster, Baroness Wake of LiddellMaud of Lancaster, Countess of UlsterJoan of Lancaster, Baroness MowbrayIsabel of Lancaster, Prioress of AmesburyEleanor of Lancaster, Countess of ArundelMary of Lancaster, Baroness Percy ||22 September 1345Leicestershireaged 63\u201364", "| Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Lancaster and Leicester|| 100px || c. 1310Grosmont Castle, Monmouthshireson of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster || Isabel de Beaumont13342 childrenMaud, Countess of LeicesterBlanche, Duchess of Lancaster || 23 March 1361Leicester Castle, LeicestershireBlack Deathaged 50\u201351"]}, {"page": "Bolingbroke Castle", "response": ["Ranulf died in 1232 without a male heir, and his titles, lands and castles passed to his sisters.
