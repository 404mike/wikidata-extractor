Barwick was a right-handed batsman who began his career a right-arm medium-fast bowler, before adding variation in the form of changes of pace and off cutters, with his restyled bowling being termed by fellow professionals like Andrew Caddick as the \"slowest seam bowling around\". Playing for Glamorgan for 18 seasons, he took 768 wickets in all formats of the game.\nMarried to Margaret Barwick, father to Michael, Kathryn and Jessica.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek Pringle", "response": ["The \"in-out\" nature of Pringle's selection continued again in 1989. Botham and Pringle played together in the Texaco Trophy, but Botham sustained a facial injury facing Glamorgan bowler Steve Barwick. On a very flat pitch at Leeds, Pringle was one of four bowlers put to the sword by the Australian batsmen. He was dropped until the final Test of the series at the Oval, where he took four wickets in the Australian first innings and was England's most successful bowler. For the following winter tour to the West Indies, the England selectors pursued a youth policy, which did not include Pringle. Chris Lewis became England's new all-rounder."]}, {"page": "Barwick (surname)", "response": ["*Steve Barwick (born 1960), Welsh cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Steve Barwick (1981\u20131996) : S.
