A holdover from the Newman era, Clive Exton's legal satire The Trial of Dr Fancy (13 September 1964), was among the first television plays on ITV to be suppressed. The deliberately absurd and savage play was a conscious break on Exton's part from the social realism of which he had grown tired.

Because of its popularity, it was moved to the peak time on Sunday afternoons. It was typically heard by around 29 per cent of the UK population and generated four to five thousand letters each week from the public. During the early war years it helped raise morale, and the verbal sparring between panel members, especially Julian Huxley and Cyril Joad, made it one of the most popular programmes.(2)", "Listeners or viewers sent in questions on subjects ranging from practical conundrums to moral dilemmas for the panel members to answer. The panellists were chosen for the unique contributions each could bring to the subject matter\u2014from the most erudite and serious to the most irreverent and comedic. One question which has become a classic example of its kind was 'How does a fly land on a ceiling? Does it loop the loop, or what?'. Although questions on religion and politics were initially included, these were banned as the programme progressed, following complaints from the Church and Government. Concern also arose with the BBC itself. One controller, A. P. Ryan, wrote to the Director-General complaining of the programme's political bias. The Controller of Programmes analysed the political attitudes of contributors and calculated a proportion of 25 left-wing and 28 right-wing along with three 'doubtfuls'. He agreed, however, that two of the three regulars, Joad and Huxley, were left-wing. They were also agnostics, a matter of irritation to Dr J. W. Welch, the Director of Religious Broadcasting. In June 1941 the Controller of Programmes instructed the panel to 'avoid all questions involving religion, political philosophy or vague generalities about life'. In June 1942 the Board of Governors reiterated that questions about religion were to be excluded.Howard Thomas, With an Independent Air, London : Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1977, 81\u201382."]}, {"page": "List of International Emmy Award winners", "response": ["|Howard Thomas"]}, {"page": "1909 in Wales", "response": ["*5 March \u2013 Howard Thomas, radio and television producer (died 1986)"]}, {"page": "Howard Thomas (wrestler)", "response": ["Thomas competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Men's Freestyle 66 kg and in the 1936 Summer Olympics in same event, but did not win a medal.Howard Thomas' profile at Sports Reference.com  He won a gold medal in the lightweight division at the 1930 British Empire Games and a bronze medal in the same event at the 1934 British Empire Games.Howard Thomas' profile at the Canadian Olympic CommitteeCommonwealth Games Federation  Thomas died in Burlington, Ontario in 1995.
