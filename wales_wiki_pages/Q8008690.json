During the abdication crisis of 1936 Dawson was believed to have attempted to influence the retirement of prime minister Stanley Baldwin on health grounds, thereby to reduce pressure on the king to abdicate. Dawson was undoubtedly indebted to and supportive of Edward but the account of his close colleague William Evans appears to clear him of any unethical manipulation in the matter. Dawson was physician and friend to both parties in the feud that was then taking place between the King and the Prime Minister. That Dawson, although initially inclined to the view that Baldwin should retire, eventually pronounced on the Prime Minister's health from medical grounds exclusively, and uninfluenced by either political or moral considerations, was confirmed through his immediate acceptance of a young medical colleague's opinion that the Prime Minister's heart was healthy, which made Baldwin's retirement on the grounds of his unfitness from heart trouble no longer tenable, so that any attempt to dethrone the Prime Minister on that assumption must fail.Evans W  Journey to Harley Street David Rendel, London (1968) "]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["***David William Evans (1866\u20131926), Welsh lawyer, public servant and rugby international", "**John William Evans (geologist) (1857\u20131930), British geologist", "**John William Evans (rugby player) (1875\u20131947), Welsh rugby union forward", "***Thomas William Evans (1821\u20131892), High Sheriff of Derbyshire and MP", "***William Evans (divine) (died c. 1720), Welsh Presbyterian divine", "***William Evans (British Army officer), British Army officer during the War of Spanish Succession", "***William Evans (lexicographer) (died 1776), Welsh minister and lexicographer", "***William Evans (1788\u20131856), British MP for North Derbyshire", "***William Evans (watercolourist) (1798\u20131877), William Evans of Eton, English artist", "***William Evans (priest) (1801\u20131869), divine and naturalist", "***William Evans (landscape painter) (1811\u20131858), William Evans of Bristol, English artist", "***Sir William Evans, 1st Baronet (1821\u20131892), British Liberal politician and benefactor", "***William Evans (judge) (1846/7\u20131918), Welsh judge and legal author", "***William Evans (Medal of Honor) (1851\u20131881), American Indian Wars soldier", "***William Evans (footballer) (1853\u20131919), Wales international footballer", "***William Evans (Australian politician) (1856\u20131914), Australian union leader and politician", "***William Evans (Australian sportsman) (1876\u20131964), Queensland cricketer and rugby union player", "***William Evans (English cricketer) (1883\u20131913), South African-born English all-round cricketer", "***William Evans (rugby player born 1883) (1883\u20131946), Welsh international rugby player", "***William Evans (Wil Ifan) (1883\u20131968), Welsh poet and Archdruid", "***William Evans (cardiologist) (1895\u20131988), Welsh cardiologist and publisher", "*** William Evans (1920\u20132013), American musician a.k.a.

Destruction of the diaries had been favoured by some family members who were concerned by their potential to arouse adverse reflection on reputations, especially that of Joseph's wife, Betty, whose alleged infidelity and at least one specific physical assault on him by her and others: [26 May 1868] . . . my ribs and breastbone were fractured . . . I have an ugly black eye with about a dozen other different wounds. were consistently blamed by him as the cause of his leaving home. However, no conclusive evidence has emerged that Betty was other than a loyal and capable wife\u2014and one who may herself have had good reason to find fault with Joseph's own personality and behaviour. E.g., in Pity the Swagman, Bethan Phillips argues that Joseph drank excessively while at home, though he generally abstained in Australia, and that he became disliked by neighbours for actively supporting landowners and their politicians at a time when they were oppressing many tenant-farmers\u2013who were consequently promoting liberal candidates."]}]}}
