As a child he worked in the coalmines, but won a miners' scholarship to a summer school at the University of Oxford, where he became a Methodist lay preacher. He married Edith Hartshorn on 4 August 1903 and the couple moved to New South Wales in 1912, when Davies became a miner in the Wollongong area, soon rising to become an official of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation.Davies won the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Wollongong in 1917, representing the Labor Party, having defeated the sitting Nationalist, John Nicholson. He went on to dominate Labor politics in the area for the next forty years, and became a loyal supporter of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang, who made Davies Minister for Public Instruction in 1927, and Minister for Education 1930\u201332.In 1949 Davies resigned from the Legislative Assembly in order to contest the new federal seat of Cunningham, which he held until his death on 17 February 1956.

In a normally safe Labor seat, in which Davies had usually been elected unopposed, Powell was strongly challenged by the Liberal's Gerald Sargent. He eventually won the by-election by 261 votes, a margin of 0.84%. This narrow victory presaged the statewide swing against Labor at the 1950 election 3 months later but it also weakened Powell's position within the local Labor Party. He lost the Labor pre-selection ballot for the 1950 election to Rex Connor, who would eventually become the federal member for Cunningham and a minister in the government of Gough Whitlam. Powell did not contest the election and retired from state politics. He did not hold party, parliamentary or ministerial office."]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Wollondilly", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\"|Billy Davies"]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Wollongong", "response": ["| Billy Davies", "| Billy Davies"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1947 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Wollongong-Kembla || Labor || |Billy Davies || ||"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1944 New South Wales state election", "response": ["|Wollongong-Kembla || Labor || |Billy Davies || ||"]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Illawarra", "response": ["| rowspan=\"4\" |Billy Davies"]}, {"page": "Lang ministry (1927)", "response": ["| Hon.
