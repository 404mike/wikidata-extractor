Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds.

In 1861, Welsh draper Pryce Pryce-Jones sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe.Goldstein. J., 101 Amazing Facts about Wales, Andrews, UK, 2013 A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system.
