He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach.Maelgwn is portrayed as a tyrant and opponent of the Church, not only in the Life of St Padarn but also in that of Saint Kentigern and of Saint Cadoc. Maelgwn, \"the great tempter of the saints\" arriving at the river Clarach, falsely accuses Padarn of theft and is thereby struck blind but restored at Padarn's intercession, after granting Padarn all the land from the river Rheidol to its source. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch.Unfortunately, church records are almost as poor for this period in the Holy Land as they are in Wales. The Patriarchate traces its line of succession to the first Christian bishops of Jerusalem, the first being James the Just in the first century AD. Jerusalem was granted autocephaly in 451 by the Council of Chalcedon and in 531 became one of the initial five patriarchates. Padarn was given a tunicIt is possible that this tunic was a chasuble, which was adopted by the clergy in the sixth century, though it is said that Jesus himself wore one at the last supper, and its use was limited to the eucharist in the eleventh century. This is plausible, as it developed from the casula, which was derived from the planeta or paenula, a cloak worn by all classes and both sexes in the Graeco-Roman world. The paenula, a cloak similar to the poncho, was an over-dress originally worn only by slaves, soldiers, and others of low degree. Because of its convenience, it was adopted by fashion in the third century as a travelling cloak. \u2013 which later featured in the best known legend associated with him \u2013 and a staff.

Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in the twelfth century were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth.
