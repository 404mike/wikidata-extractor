He has been called one of the Grand Masters of the science fiction art world.In 1966 he joined the Royal Air Force, but soon thereafter he left and signed up at the Newport School of Art for a year's foundation course.\nAfter that, he went on to complete a 3-year Diploma in Art and Design at Saint Martin's School of Art in London. When he left Saint Martin's in 1972 he had already joined the recently established illustration agency Young Artists. He has been with this agency, later renamed Arena, ever since.\nHe is today a contemporary British science fiction illustrator. His work mostly deals with science fiction with erotic overtones.  His paintings are generally intricate photo-realistic works of beautiful women set against advanced machines and spaceships.  While his preparatory sketches are more erotically focused, his final works and published book covers have a more academic tone portraying far off and imaginary worlds.Apart from book and game covers, Burns briefly worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, and his illustrations and paintings comprise much of the book Mechanismo by Harry Harrison. He has also had books of his own works published, including Lightship, Planet Story (written by Harry Harrison), Transluminal, and Imago.\nBurns won the Hugo award for best professional artist three times and has also been awarded 12 BSFA awards. Well regarded in fandom, he was artist guest of honour at the 1987 Worldcon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science fiction and fantasy artists", "response": ["*Jim Burns (born 1948) (Hugo)"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| Doris Lessing (UK)Alfred Bester (US)Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (USSR)Jim Burns (artist)Ray Harryhausen (film)Joyce Slater and Ken Slater (fan)David Langford (special fan)"]}, {"page": "1961", "response": ["* October 14 \u2013 Jim Burns, British science-fiction illustrator "]}, {"page": "Harry Harrison (writer)", "response": ["* Planet Story (1978), published as a large format book with colour illustrations by Jim Burns"]}, {"page": "BSFA Award", "response": [":Artist: Jim Burns", ":Artist: Jim Burns", ":Artist: Jim Burns", ":Artwork: Cover of Worldcon Programme Book by Jim Burns", ":Artwork: Cover of Other Edens III by Jim Burns", ":Artwork: Cover of Hearts, Hands and Voices by Jim Burns", ":Artwork: Jim Burns (cover for Red Dust by Paul J.

Many of these poets joined Allen Ginsberg and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall International Poetry Incarnation on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British happening. Earlier British happenings included John Latham's event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; Gustav Metzger's 1964 auto-destructive art; Adrian Henri's 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's The Cavern Club; and Jeff Nuttall's events in Better Books. They had their roots in Dada events at the Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich) at the start of the century.Jeff Nuttall, Bomb Culture", "Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, Geraldine Monk is very much a poet of the North of England. Like Maggie O'Sullivan, she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including Jim Burns, Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed, CUSP, mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.Geraldine Monk, CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).", "The Cambridge poets were a group centred around J. H. Prynne and included Andrew Crozier, John James, Douglas Oliver, Veronica Forrest-Thomson, Peter Riley, Tim Longville and John Riley. Prynne was influenced by Charles Olson and Crozier was partly responsible for Carl Rakosi's return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The Grosseteste Review, which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of The English Intelligencer, a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by Peter Riley.
