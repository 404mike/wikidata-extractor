The Barrys in Ireland, as well as the family of Giraldus, who were lords of it, are said to have derived their names from this island.

At low water, there is a broken causey to go over, or els over the shalow streamelet of Barrey-brook on the sands. The isle is about a mile in cumpace, and hath very good corne, grasse, and sum wood; the ferme of it worth aio a yere. There ys no dwelling in the isle, but there is in the middle of it a fair little chapel of St Barrok, where much pilgrimage was usid.'\" Ernest Rhys, the Editor, adds in 1908: \"The 'fair little chapel' has disappeared, and 'Barry Island' is now, since the construction of the great dock, connected with the mainland, it is covered with houses, and its estimated capital value is now \u00a3250,000.\"", "Barry Island is part of the Baruc electoral ward, which includes Cold Knap and the southwestern part of Barry.
