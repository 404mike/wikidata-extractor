Iolo Morganwg suggested they were originally the work of bards from Glamorgan who had their manuscripts copied into collections stored at Plas y Fan, Neath Abbey, Margam Abbey and Raglan Library, and compiled by Meurig Dafydd and Lewys Morgannwg, amongst others, in the 1700s. These were suggested to have again been transcribed by Edward Dafydd, John Bradford and Llywelyn Si\u00f4n. Morganwg suggested that he had collected some of Si\u00f4n and Bradford's manuscripts, while the majority, including all of Lewys Morgannwg's sources, were lost.

He also spent large sums on public improvements. To check the encroachments of the sea on the Glamorganshire coast he built in 1606 a sea-wall at Aberthaw which was destroyed by a storm a few months later. At Merthyrmawr he constructed an aqueduct and seems to have attempted a harbour at the mouth of the River Ogmore. He also had a vineyard on his estate. Death intervened before he had arranged the endowment of a school, but his intentions were carried out by his heir with the founding of Cowbridge Grammar School."]}, {"page": "William Bassett (died 1586)", "response": ["It is said that the bard Meurig Dafydd once presented a praise poem to Bassett."]}, {"page": "Si\u00f4n Dafydd Rhys", "response": ["The bard Meurig Dafydd addressed a cywydd to Stradling and Rhys on the publication of the grammar."]}]}}
