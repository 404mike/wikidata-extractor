Her first public recognition came in 19 March 1930 with a performance of her Piano Concerto, conducted by her teacher there, Karel Jirak.

Her work has been compared to that of Bartok, who was an acknowledged influence, and also to Beethoven and Mozart, as well as (favourably) to contemporaries such as Britten.See Beer, 'Sounds', op. cit., p. She produced over 200 works. According to Ailie Bloony, Maconchy was \"a gestural composer, concerning herself with short musical fragments, as opposed to large-scale concepts or templates\", at least in part because of her \"ideology\" as a composer, so that \"she never planned anything out, musically speaking, in any great detail in advance of composition, [and by using shorter formats] she could afford to explore the possibilities implicit in the ideas themselves as they arose\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 226. In terms of style, Maconchy had \"a predilection for intervallic composition\", and, \"profoundly influenced by the resonances produced by certain intervals, [she] tended to build works around one or a small number of intervals, which varied according to the work in question\". A favoured \"harmonic device\" was the \"simultaneous use of major and minor sonorities\", which \"came to denote episodes of heightened emotion\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 229. Blunnie is acknowledging here composer Grace Williams assessment of this device as a \"fingerprint\" of Maconchy. It has been argued that her work is often \"driven by rhythm\", which gives it its characteristic confluence of \"energy, dynamism and imagination\".Blunnie, 'Passion', op. cit., p. 230."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Maw", "response": ["* Severn Bridge Variation (1966) for a composite work with Malcolm Arnold, Michael Tippett, Alun Hoddinott, Grace Williams and Daniel Jones"]}, {"page": "Barry, Vale of Glamorgan", "response": ["* Composer Grace Williams (1906 \u2013 1977), generally regarded as Wales's most notable female composer, was born in Barry and lived there during her latter years.
