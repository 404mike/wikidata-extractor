He became the sole king of Seisyllwg in 920 and shortly thereafter established Deheubarth, and proceeded to gain control over the entire country from Prestatyn to Pembroke. As a descendant of Rhodri Mawr through his father Cadell, Hywel was a member of the Dinefwr branch of the dynasty. He was recorded as King of the Britons in the Annales Cambri\u00e6 and the Annals of Ulster.\nHywel is highly esteemed among other medieval Welsh rulers. His name is particularly linked with the codification of traditional Welsh law, which were thenceforth known as the Laws of Hywel Dda. The latter part of his name (Dda, lit. \"Good\") refers to the fact that his laws were just and good. The historian Dafydd Jenkins sees in them compassion rather than punishment, plenty of common sense and recognition of the rights of women. Hywel Dda was a well-educated man even by modern standards, having a good knowledge of Welsh, Latin, and English.The office building and original home of the Senedd is named T\u0177 Hywel (\"Hywel House\" or \"Hywel's House\") in honour of Hywel Dda. The original assembly chamber, now known as Siambr Hywel (\"Hywel's Chamber\"), is used for educational courses and for children and young people's debates. The local health board of south-west Wales also bears his name.", "link_mentions": {}}}
