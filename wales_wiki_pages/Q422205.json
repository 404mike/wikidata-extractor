He became the sole king of Seisyllwg in 920 and shortly thereafter established Deheubarth, and proceeded to gain control over the entire country from Prestatyn to Pembroke. As a descendant of Rhodri Mawr through his father Cadell, Hywel was a member of the Dinefwr branch of the dynasty. He was recorded as King of the Britons in the Annales Cambri\u00e6 and the Annals of Ulster.\nHywel is highly esteemed among other medieval Welsh rulers. His name is particularly linked with the codification of traditional Welsh law, which were thenceforth known as the Laws of Hywel Dda. The latter part of his name (Dda, lit. \"Good\") refers to the fact that his laws were just and good. The historian Dafydd Jenkins sees in them compassion rather than punishment, plenty of common sense and recognition of the rights of women. Hywel Dda was a well-educated man even by modern standards, having a good knowledge of Welsh, Latin, and English.The office building and original home of the Senedd is named T\u0177 Hywel (\"Hywel House\" or \"Hywel's House\") in honour of Hywel Dda.

Owain was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided Caithness, by which a much larger area, including Sutherland, is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine's personal authority extended so far north, so the attacks were probably directed at his allies, comprising simple looting expeditions.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 107, Ms. D, s.a. 934; Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 67\u201369; Miller, \"\u00c6thelstan\"; Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 342; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 160\u2013166; Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men, p. 203.", "The Annals of Clonmacnoise state that \"the Scottish men compelled [\u00c6thelstan] to return without any great victory\", while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition.

Edmund was initially forced to accept the reverse, the first major setback for the West Saxon dynasty since Alfred's reign, but he was able to recover his position following Anlaf's death in 941. In 942 he took back control of the Five Boroughs and in 944 he regained control over the whole of England when he expelled the Viking kings of York. Eadred had to deal with further revolts when he became king and York was not finally conquered until 954. \u00c6thelstan had achieved a dominant position over other British kings and Edmund maintained this, perhaps apart from Scotland. The north Welsh king Idwal Foel may have allied with the Vikings as he was killed by the English in 942 and his kingdom of Gwynedd was conquered by the southern Welsh king Hywel Dda. The British kingdom of Strathclyde may also have sided with the Vikings as Edmund ravaged it in 945 and then ceded it to Malcolm I of Scotland. Edmund also continued his brother's friendly relations with Continental rulers, several of whom were married to his half-sisters.", "Edmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from \u00c6thelstan, but Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, apparently took advantage of Edmund's early weakness to withhold fealty and may have supported Anlaf Guthfrithson, as according to the Annales Cambri\u00e6 he was killed by the English in 942 and his kingdom was then conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales. Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in \u00c6thelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings. Attestations became more common again after Eadred succeeded Edmund. In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"king of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title.", "By 945 both Scotland and Strathclyde had kings who had assumed the throne since Brunanburh, and it is likely that whereas Scotland allied with England, Strathclyde held to its alliance with the Vikings. In that year Edmund ravaged Strathclyde. According to the thirteenth-century chronicler Roger of Wendover, the invasion was supported by Hywel Dda, and Edmund had two sons of the king of Strathclyde blinded, perhaps to deprive their father of throneworthy heirs. Edmund then gave the kingdom to Malcolm I of Scotland in return for a pledge to defend it on land and on sea, a decision variously interpreted by historians. Dumville and the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards regard it as granting Strathclyde to the Scottish king in return for an acknowledgement of Edmund's overlordship, whereas Williams thinks it probably means that he agreed to Malcolm's overlordship of the area in return for an alliance against the Dublin Vikings, and Stenton and Miller see it as recognition by Edmund that Northumbria was the northern limit of Anglo-Saxon England."]}, {"page": "Inch", "response": ["Similar definitions are recorded in both English and Welsh medieval law tracts.

According to William of Malmesbury, after the meeting at Eamont \u00c6thelstan summoned the Welsh kings to Hereford, where he imposed a heavy annual tribute and fixed the border between England and Wales in the Hereford area at the River Wye.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 340\u2013341; Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, p. 163 The dominant figure in Wales was Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, described by the historian of early medieval Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards as \"the firmest ally of the 'emperors of Britain' among all the kings of his day\". Welsh kings attended \u00c6thelstan's court between 928 and 935 and witnessed charters at the head of the list of laity (apart from the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde), showing that their position was regarded as superior to that of the other great men present. The alliance produced peace between Wales and England, and within Wales, lasting throughout \u00c6thelstan's reign, though some Welsh resented the status of their rulers as under-kings, as well as the high level of tribute imposed upon them. In Armes Prydein Vawr (The Great Prophecy of Britain), a Welsh poet foresaw the day when the British would rise up against their Saxon oppressors and drive them into the sea.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, pp. 497\u2013523", "\u00c6thelstan set out on his campaign in May 934, accompanied by four Welsh kings: Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, Idwal Foel of Gwynedd, Morgan ap Owain of Gwent, and Tewdwr ap Griffri of Brycheiniog.

This aimed to replace Welsh criminal law with English law."]}, {"page": "Deheubarth", "response": ["Deheubarth was united around 920 by Hywel Dda out of the territories of Seisyllwg and Dyfed, which had come into his possession. Later on, the Kingdom of Brycheiniog was also added. Caerleon was previously the principal court of the area, but Hywel's dynasty fortified and built up a new base at Dinefwr, near Llandeilo, giving them their name.", "The long and capable rule of Gruffydd's son the Lord Rhys  and the civil wars that followed Owain's death in Gwynedd  briefly permitted the South to reassert the hegemony Hywel Dda had enjoyed two centuries before. On his death in 1197, though, Rhys redivided his kingdom among his several sons and none of them ever again rivalled his power. By the time Llywelyn the Great won the wars in Gwynedd, in the first half of the 12th century, lords in Deheubarth merely appear among his clients."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Gwynedd", "response": ["The House of Aberffraw was displaced in 942 by Hywel Dda, a King of Deheubarth from a junior line of descent from Rhodri Mawr. This occurred because Idwal Foel, the King of Gwynedd, was determined to cast off English overlordship and took up arms against the new English king, Edmund I. Idwal and his brother Elisedd were both killed in battle against Edmund's forces. By normal custom Idwal's crown should have passed to his sons, Ieuaf and Iago ab Idwal, but Hywel Dda intervened and sent Iago and Ieuaf into exile in Ireland and established himself as ruler over Gwynedd until his death in 950 when the House of Aberffraw was restored. Nonetheless, surviving manuscripts of Cyfraith Hywel recognize the importance of the lords of Aberffraw as overlords of Wales along with the rulers of Deheubarth.Of the three surviving groups of manuscripts of the Cyfraith Hywel (all dating from the 12th century or later), one group recognizes Gwynedd exclusively, another Deheubarth exclusively, and the last both together.
