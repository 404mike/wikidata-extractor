It is considered to be \"of exceptional quality in national terms\" and was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building until February 2020, when it was updated to Grade I and became the first purpose-built Victorian pub in England to gain this honour.In 1907, Thomas designed the Vines, a public house on Lime Street, also for Cains. This is also listed at Grade II*. In addition, it is generally believed that he designed Audley House on London Road, a shop for Owen Owen, and some of the homes surrounding Sefton Park, as well as additions to the Brook House on Smithdown Road.", "link_mentions": {}}}
