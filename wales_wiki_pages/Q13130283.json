Drinkwater, a 12-year-old schoolgirl, was raped and shot in  the woods in Penllergaer, Swansea. The case, which became known as the Little Red Riding Hood murder, is one of the oldest active cold cases in the United Kingdom. In 2008, a DNA profile of the suspect was extracted from her clothes, possibly the oldest sample in the world to be successfully extracted in a murder investigation. In 2019, the DNA was used to rule out notorious Welsh murderer Harold Jones as a suspect.", "link_mentions": {}}}
