Callippus modified this system, using five spheres for his models of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars and retaining four spheres for the models of Jupiter and Saturn, thus making 33 spheres in all. Each planet is attached to the innermost of its own particular set of spheres.  Although the models of Eudoxus and Callippus qualitatively describe the major features of the motion of the planets, they fail to account exactly for these motions and therefore cannot provide quantitative predictions.Neugebauer, History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, vol. 2, pp. 677\u201385.

Lloyd noted that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to \"legitimate their own positions\", laying \"claim to a new kind of wisdom\u00a0... that purported to yield superior enlightenment, even superior practical effectiveness\". Medical writers in the Hippocratic tradition maintained that their discussions were based on necessary demonstrations, a theme developed by Aristotle in his Posterior Analytics. One element of this polemic for science was an insistence on a clear and unequivocal presentation of arguments, rejecting the imagery, analogy, and myth of the old wisdom. Some of their claimed naturalistic explanations of phenomena have been found to be quite fanciful, with little reliance on actual observations."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*G.
