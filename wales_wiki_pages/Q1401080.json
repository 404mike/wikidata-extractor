The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656, and Manwgan was able to take his rightful place on the Powysian throne. However Eiludd is unlikely to be the same as Eluadd ap Glast as Eiludd is recorded as the brother of Manwgan and son of Selyf in Jesus College Ms. 20, whereas in the Harleian Ms. 3859 he is Manwgan's uncle and a brother of Selyf.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Manwgan ap Selyf (613)"]}, {"page": "List of monarchs of Powys", "response": ["*Manwgan ap Selyf, (613)"]}, {"page": "Beli ab Eiludd", "response": ["Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642.  It is more likely, however, that, as the genealogies state, he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf.  The former is more likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw describing the Mathrafal dynasty as descendants of Selyf. It was also likely, assuming Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, that Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection."]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in the 7th century", "response": [":*Manwgan ap Selyf, King (613)"]}]}}
