Together with Joe Farman and Brian G. Gardiner he discovered the \"Ozone Hole\" in the 1980s.Shanklin has described his role at the BAS as being that of a \"general dogsbody\" at the time of the discovery of the \"ozone hole\". He calibrated an instrument called the Dobson Ozone Spectrophotometer which provided data on atmospheric ozone.\nIn an article discussing the discovery, the BBC quotes him as saying\n\nPerhaps the most startling lesson from the ozone hole is just how quickly our planet can change. Given the speed with which humankind can affect it, following the precautionary principle is likely to be the safest road to future prosperity.\nShanklin maintains the ozone pages at BAS.\nHe plays cricket, is a bell-ringer, an active local naturalist and is a keen amateur astronomer, being Director of the British Astronomical Association's Comet Section [1].\nIn December 2020 it was announced that the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee had named a glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula after Shanklin, in part to mark the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the continent.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
