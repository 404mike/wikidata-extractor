Educated at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth she became a science teacher, but quit her job in 1906 on hearing Nellie Martel speak of women's suffrage, joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and moved to London. In 1907 she became a WSPU organiser, and after Christabel Pankhurst fled to Paris, Barrett became joint organiser of the national WSPU campaign. In 1912, despite no journalistic background, she took charge of the new newspaper The Suffragette. Barrett was arrested on occasions for activities linked to the suffrage movement and in 1913\u20131914 spent some time incognito to avoid re-arrest.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["On the last day of April, the WSPU offices were raided by the police, and a number of women were arrested and taken to Bow Street.

A. R. Wylie", "response": ["In 1911, Wylie returned to England, living in St John's Wood, London, and joined the suffragette movement. She provided a safe house for women who were released from prison where they could recover from hunger strikes under the \"Cat and Mouse Act\" without being watched by the police. She struck up a relationship with the editor of \"The Suffragette\", Rachel Barrett, and by mid 1913 was a useful \"sub-editor and bottle-washer\". She traveled with Annie and Jessie Kenney and Mary Richardson to spend a week in France with Christabel Pankhurst. Wylie and Barrett then traveled to Edinburgh to Wylie's aunt Jane, where Barrett had surgery and lived under a pseudonym to avoid re-arrest. Both returned to London for Christmas 1913, and continued to secretly edit The Suffragette until May 1914 when police again raided the premises in Lincoln's Inn. In 1917, Barrett and Wylie traveled to America. They bought a car and roamed around the country, from New York to San Francisco, a remarkable journey with the state of roads and cars at the time."]}, {"page": "Barrett (name)", "response": ["* Rachel Barrett (1874-1953), British editor and suffragette "]}, {"page": "Nellie Martel", "response": ["She and Pankhurst successfully campaigned Nelly Crocker, Rachel Barrett, Aeta Lamb and Emmeline Pankhurst against an anti-enfranchisement candidate in Devon in January 1908, but Martel left the WSPU later that year.

She worked with Rachel Barrett, Elsa Gye and Mary Gawthorpe during the Dundee by-election the next year. In 1908, Fraser attended the 'monster meeting' Women's Sunday and wrote to Isabel Seymour that it was 'successful but not entirely satisfactory', Fraser estimated half a million people attended ( a number supported by The Times estimates) but said that at three of the speaker platforms 'there was much rowdyism' and said 'it seemed to me that the mass of people were simply curious - not opposed- simply indifferent. Fraser  was also becoming disillusioned with the violent militant tactics of the WSPU. She criticised the actions of one WSPU member who broke the windows of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She resigned from the WSPU soon afterwards, and was approached by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and agreed to work for them. She was a member of the NUWSS national executive committee for fourteen years."]}, {"page": "Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial", "response": ["Shortly after Emmeline Pankhurst's death in 1928 a Pankhurst Memorial Fund was established, with her fellow suffragettes Rosamund Massey and Katherine \"Kitty\" Marshall (Pankhurst's former bodyguard in the Women's Social and Political Union) as joint secretaries. The fund's objectives were to arrange a headstone for her grave, to acquire Georgina Brakenbury's portrait of Pankhurst and to erect a public statue. Some spectators, such as Nancy Astor, believed the idea of a statue impractical, noting that Pankhurst herself did not believe she was \"statuesque\" and the fact that the British public were facing austere times, which would impose financial constraints on the project. In reality raising the money, which was largely organised by The Suffragette's editor Rachel Barrett, was not the issue; finding a location for the statue was the real problem. Although the Chief Commissioner of Public Works, Sir Lionel Earle, was sympathetic to their cause, he believed that it would be impractical to place the statue in Westminster. After several locations were rejected Marshall secured permission to erect the statue in a corner of Victoria Tower Gardens near the Houses of Parliament. Though this required a special Parliamentary bill, the Conservative MP William Bull ensured its smooth passage."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women writers", "response": ["*Rachel Barrett (1874\u20131953), suffragette and newspaper editor"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Rachel Barrett (1874\u20131953), suffragette, newspaper editor"]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage in Wales", "response": ["Due to her family connections and high-profile militant action, Margaret Mackworth, the 2nd Viscountess Rhondda, is probably the most well-known Welsh suffragette. Her mother Sybil Thomas and Merthyr Ironmaster's wife, Rose Mary Crawshay, were both well connected suffragists whose work is well documented. Millicent Mackenzie and to a lesser extent Amy Dillwyn are remembered more for connections outside the sphere of women's suffrage, but were both important Welsh activists for the cause. The majority of suffragists either working in Wales or Welsh suffragists who were active outside the country are many but poorly documented. Alice Abadam, a renowned speaker and activist, was the daughter of the High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire. She later became the chairperson of the Federated Council of Suffrage Movements. Rachel Barrett, a science teacher from south Wales, rose to prominence within the WSPU and was chosen by Annie Kenney to assist in running the WSPU national campaign from 1912. She was also assistant editor of The Suffragette."]}, {"page": "Rachel Barrett (suffragette)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rachel Barrett"]}]}}
