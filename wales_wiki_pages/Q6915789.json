His parents were of humble station, and he received a very elementary education but his artistic talent led to his being taken into service by Thomas Pennant about 1769. Pennant helped him to study drawing and engraving, and Griffith became his constant companion on his tours and excursions, making the drawings and engravings for Pennant's numerous works. Griffith became proficient both as a draughtsman and as an engraver.\nOn leaving Pennant's service he settled at Wibnant, near Holyhead, where he obtained plenty of employment as an engraver. He was alive in 1809, when he wrote a letter defending himself from an attack to the Gentleman's Magazine. Francis Grose employed Griffith to engrave some of the plates in his Antiquities.\nGriffith also painted watercolours of Welsh scenes, churches, country houses, and portraits, including two self-portraits.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Pennant", "response": ["As a traveller he visited Scotland and many other parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffith, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.", "In 1754, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and resigned his fellowship because \"my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and that I never should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society.\"Literary Life. p. 2 When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the \"Pennant Collection\", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffith and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.", "The artist Moses Griffith, a native of Bryncroes in the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, provided illustrations to most of Pennant's books. He was employed full-time by Pennant and accommodated at Downing. Many of these paintings are included in the Pennant Collection held by the National Museum of Wales. Another artist whom Pennant employed on an occasional basis was John Ingleby of Halkyn. He mostly supplied town scenes and vignettes.", "Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was his account of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second appearing in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and on the basis of these details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London.Literary Life. pp.16\u201318 On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.Jardine, 1833. p.29"]}, {"page": "John Lightfoot (biologist)", "response": ["The Flora Scotica: or, a systematic arrangement, in the Linnaean method, of the native plants of Scotland and the Hebrides, published in London in 1777 as a bulky book of two volumes for a total of 1151 pages, is Lightfoot's greatest work. Many of the illustrations are drawn by Pennant's artist, Moses Griffith, and engraved by Peter Mazell; some are both drawn and engraved by Mazell."]}, {"page": "1747 in Wales", "response": ["*6 April - Moses Griffith, artist (died 1819)"]}, {"page": "Moses Griffith (engraver)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Moses Griffith (artist)"]}, {"page": "Moses Griffiths (engraver)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Moses Griffith (artist)"]}, {"page": "Moses Griffiths", "response": ["#REDIRECT Moses Griffith (artist)"]}, {"page": "Church of St Beuno and St Mary", "response": ["Other notables who are associated with the church include Thomas Pennant, an 18th century antiquarian, naturalist and traveller, who is buried near the church organ in 1798, and Moses Griffiths, Pennants illustrator, who has a tomb and plaque in the graveyard, in 1819. In 1783, Pennant in his role as local magistrate, sentenced a local resident, Frances Williams to death for stealing from Griffiths, but the sentenced was reduced, and she became the first Welsh woman to be transported to Australia. The church and tower were rebuilt and remodelled by Ambrose Poynter in 1842-3, under the patronage of lady Emma Pennant and the first Baron Mostyn, Edward Lloyd. The interior was further renovated in 1876 and 1888."]}]}}
