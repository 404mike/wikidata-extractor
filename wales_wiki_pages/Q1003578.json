Ten days later, he would repeat the feat, although his victim this time was an Albatros two-seater reconnaissance plane, and Green had help from fellow ace Franklin Saunders. On 18 February 1917, Green battled German ace Rudolf von Eschwege in a dogfight during which Green's gun jammed, and wingman J. C. F. Owen was shot down. Green returned to form on 18 and 19 March, destroying a Friedrichshafen G seaplane and driving another down out of control on the 18th, and setting fire to an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft on the 19th. Green thus became the only pilot to become an ace flying the B.E. 12. These three successes earned him the Distinguished Service Order.Shores & Rolfe (2001), p.72."]}, {"page": "List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1914", "response": ["| Franklin Saunders was a World War I flying ace credited with eight aerial victories."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Franklin Saunders"]}]}}
