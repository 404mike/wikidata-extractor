He made his film debut in the 1961 Scotland Yard short Wings of Death, before going on to appear in such popular British TV series as Z-Cars and Compact. By 1967 his career had progressed to prominent roles opposite Shirley MacLaine in Vittorio De Sica's Woman Times Seven (1967), Stanley Baker in Peter Yates' crime caper Robbery (1967), and Peter O'Toole in Herbert Ross's musical remake of Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969). This led to him getting his own TV series in 1968, Virgin of the Secret Service, in which he played the dashing Captain Robert Virgin, travelling the world battling evil in the name of the British Empire. The series was not a success and he found himself making guest appearances in other adventure series, such as The Champions; Department S; and UFO (\"The Dalotek Affair\", 1971).In the early 1970s he moved to Hollywood where he appeared in a number of films, including Raid on Rommel, The Love Machine, Swedish Fly Girls, and How to Steal an Airplane (all 1971). Returning to Britain he appeared in the action thriller Penny Gold (1973), and continued to guest-star in popular television series of the period such as Jason King, The Protectors, The Zoo Gang and Doctor Who.Later in life he concentrated on the stage, appearing at the National Theatre as Nobel prize-winning Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Michael Frayn's Copenhagen in 2000.Besides his acting career, Greyn studied architecture and design at the Open University and City University, London.
