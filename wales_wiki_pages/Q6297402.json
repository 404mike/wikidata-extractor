Always it is saved by Hercule Poirot, the great French [sic] detective, who theorizes with the gusto of a man for whom the visible world hardly exists. He carries us with him, for he does not take himself too seriously, and he salts his shrewdness with wit. For a ruthless investigator he is an arrant sentimentalist; but that is one of the ways in which Mrs Christie prevents her problem from becoming tedious. Mr Sullivan is obviously very happy in the part, and his contribution to the evening's entertainment is a considerable one. Mr Boxer Watsonizes pleasantly, and Miss Joyce Bland, as a young lady who must wait until the very end before knowing a moment's happiness, contrives to excite our sympathy for her distress. The remainder of the cast is rather serviceable than exciting.The Times December 9, 1930 (Page 12)\"", "Joyce Bland as Lucia Amory"]}, {"page": "Bland (surname)", "response": ["* Joyce Bland (1906\u20131963), British film actress"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1935", "response": ["|The Right Age to Marry||Maclean Rogers||Frank Pettingell, Joyce Bland||Comedy||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1933", "response": ["|The Crime at Blossoms||Maclean Rogers||Hugh Wakefield, Joyce Bland||Crime||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1938", "response": ["| Coming of Age || Manning Haynes || Eliot Makeham, Joyce Bland || Comedy ||"]}, {"page": "List of people from Newport", "response": ["* Joyce Bland (actress)"]}, {"page": "Goodnight, Vienna", "response": ["* Joyce Bland - Countess Helga"]}, {"page": "Spy of Napoleon", "response": ["* Joyce Bland -  Empress Eugenie"]}, {"page": "Sixty Glorious Years", "response": ["*Joyce Bland as Florence Nightingale"]}, {"page": "The Flag Lieutenant (1932 film)", "response": ["The Flag Lieutenant is a 1932 British war film based on the play by William Price Drury and directed by and starring Henry Edwards, Anna Neagle, Joyce Bland, and Peter Gawthorne.
