Captained by Watcyn Thomas, Boon later argued that the Welsh forwards deserved all the credit for the Welsh victoryGoodwin (1984), pg 192. even though Boon scored all the Welsh points in a 7\u20133 victory. At half-time, England led the game 3\u20130 with a try from Walter Elliot; but soon after the restart, England's Ronald Gerrard kicked a loose ball across the ground straight into Boon's arms,Wales Rugby Union, Wales vs England Classics 1933 and he calmly drop kicked the ball through the posts to take a 4\u20133 lead. A few minutes later Boon had extended the lead when the ball came back from a maul to Davey, who passed to Boon, and with the English defence out of position, he crossed at the corner and touched the ball down behind the posts for a try. Vivian Jenkins converted the try which was registered on the score board, but strangely the referee would later disallow the attempt after the game. The decision did not change the result, and Wales had finally beaten the 'Twickenham bogey' and Boon was hailed as a Welsh hero. Boon missed the next game against Scotland due to a knee injury but was back to face Ireland. Wales lost the game and the Welsh selectors dropped 11 of the squad from future fixtures.

The selectors wanted to stick with the same team that had beaten the English, but Maurice Turnbull had reported in injured. The selectors therefore decided to drop his partner, the reliable Harry Bowcott to allow for the Swansea partnership of Evans and Ron Morris to take their place.Griffiths (1984), pg 193.

During his presidency, Rocyn-Jones clashed with the Welsh selectors, which included past Welsh players like Cliff Jones, Harry Bowcott and Rees Stephens, over the nature of the Welsh play.
