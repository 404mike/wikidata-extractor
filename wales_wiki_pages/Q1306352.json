Known for his rugged appearance and intense, grounded screen persona; he was one of the top British male film stars of the late 1950s, and later a producer.Born into a coal mining family in Glamorgan, Baker began his acting career in the West End. Following national service in the Royal Army Service Corps after the Second World War, he befriended actor Richard Burton and began appearing in film and television roles. He played the lead role in Hell Drivers and supporting role in The Guns of Navarone.  He was producer and lead actor in the 1964 film Zulu, in which he portrayed John Chard. \nBaker's performance in the 1959 film Yesterday's Enemy was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actor, and he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his turn in the BBC serial How Green Was My Valley. He was awarded a knighthood in 1976, although he died before the investiture ceremony: a heavy smoker, he developed lung cancer and he died in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Achilles", "response": ["* The 1956 film Helen of Troy by Stanley Baker"]}, {"page": "February 28", "response": ["*1928 \u2013 Stanley Baker, Welsh actor and producer (died 1976)"]}, {"page": "Harry Secombe", "response": ["|Richard Attenborough, Stanley Baker"]}, {"page": "Sean Connery", "response": ["In early 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him his first film role, as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech impediment in Montgomery Tully's No Road Back alongside Skip Homeier, Paul Carpenter, Patricia Dainton, and Norman Wooland.

The next year, he agreed to play Josip Broz Tito in a film biography, since he admired the Yugoslav leader.

Baker told Caine to meet the director, Cy Endfield, who informed him that he already had given the part to James Booth, a fellow Cockney who was Caine's friend, because he \"looked more Cockney\" than Caine did.
