The club was forced to resort to legal action to protect themselves from being forced out of the English football league system by FAW secretary Alun Evans, who was promoting the first national League of Wales formed for the 1992\u201393 season.

A few matches were played there until it hosted its final international fixture, a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying match on 14 October 1998 against Belarus. In January 1990, the club was dealt a blow when thieves broke into the stadium following an FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers. They stole \u00a350,000 of gate receipts by gaining access to offices via the pitch. The money was eventually recovered. Some was found in the house of one of the perpetrators; the majority was found buried on Caerphilly Mountain. Later the same year, the FAW chose to move a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying match between Wales and Belgium to Cardiff Arms Park over fears that proposed safety improvements at Ninian Park would not be completed in time. FAW secretary Alun Evans alluded to the fact that matches between Belgium and the Home Nations were still deemed to be \"sensitive\" following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. Cardiff threatened legal action over the decision, stating that the club could \"meet any deadline\" to complete the work, but were unsuccessful.

These hopes were boosted by a 1\u20130 victory over Scotland in Glasgow with Rush scoring the only goal of the game, while FAW secretary Alun Evans also claimed that the match essentially saved the organisation from bankruptcy by ensuring large crowds for their remaining group matches. This was followed by a 3\u20130 victory over Spain with Rush scoring a brace and Hughes a bicycle kick described in The Independent as \"a goal of jaw-dropping audacity and athleticism\"."]}]}}
