He grew up in Aberystwyth. He was identified as dyslexic at the age of eight and made his way through the education system by avoiding writing as far as possible. Duncan went on to study Mining Geology in the University of Leicester, for which he attained a BSc (Hons). He returned to Leicester to study Geology and Satellite Imagery for a PhD, but did not complete this. Duncan moved to Taiwan in 1989, where he established an environmental education development programme on behalf of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community. He returned to Leicestershire in 1993, where he lives in Glenfield working as an author and lecturer at De Montfort University.Being dyslexic, it was the invention of the word processor that enabled him to develop his storytelling and writing skills. He now uses dictation software as a tool in the writing process.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip K.
