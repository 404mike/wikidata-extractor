It was the first Protestant college to be founded at the university, and it is the only Oxford college to date from Elizabeth's reign.Gibson, p. 21 It was the first new Oxford college since 1555, in the reign of Queen Mary, when Trinity College and St John's College were founded as Roman Catholic colleges.Gibson, p. 20 The foundation charter named a principal (David Lewis), eight fellows, eight scholars, and eight commissioners to draw up the statutes for the college.Hardy, p. 13 The commissioners included Hugh Price, who had petitioned the queen to found a college at Oxford \"that he might bestow his estate of the maintenance of certain scholars of Wales to be trained up in good letters.\"Hardy, p. 6, quoting Anthony Wood The college was originally intended primarily for the education of clergy. The particular intention was to satisfy a need for dedicated, learned clergy to promote the Elizabethan Religious Settlement in the parishes of England, Ireland and Wales. The college has since broadened the range of subjects offered, beginning with the inclusion of medicine and law, and now offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university. The letters patent issued by Elizabeth I made it clear that the education of a priest in the 16th century included more than just theology, however:Baker (1971), p. 1", "When the college was founded in 1571, the first charter installed David Lewis as Principal and named eight others as the first Fellows of the college. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 Fellows. There is now no limit on the number of Fellowships that the Governing Body can create.Statute IV \"The Fellows\", clause 3 \"Number of Fellowships\" The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows.Statute IV, clause 1 \"Classes of Fellows and qualifications\" Professorial Fellows are those Professors and Readers of the University who are allocated to the college by the University.Statute IV, clause 5 \"Professorial Fellowships\" One of these professorships is the Jesus Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic Studies at an English university. Celtic scholars such as Sir John Rhys and Ellis Evans have held the position since its creation in 1877. The chair is currently vacant, having been held by Thomas Charles-Edwards until his retirement in 2011. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both Professorial Fellows. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past Official Fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also Senior and Junior Research Fellows.
