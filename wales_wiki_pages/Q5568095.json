A winger who was the first black player to represent the Welsh national rugby union team, when he made his debut versus Tonga on 12 June 1986 (the first player was Mark Brown, Pontypool Flanker earlier that year). In contrast, George Bennett became the first black player for the Welsh national rugby league team in 1935.\nWebbe played his club rugby for Bridgend RFC and was in the Wales squad for the 1987 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. He was an unused substitute in Wales' first match of the tournament against Ireland, but came into the team in place of Ieuan Evans on the right wing for the second match against Tonga. After scoring two tries in the match, Webbe was on the receiving end of a high tackle by Tonga full-back Tali Ete'aki that knocked him unconscious; Wales had already used their two allowed substitutions by that point, so the coaching staff decided to leave him on the pitch rather than go down to 14 men. Despite having suffered a concussion, Webbe scored a third try after a long solo run. The concussion resulted in Webbe being sent home from the tournament, and he retains no memories of the match after that tackle. Thanks to Webbe's hat-trick, Wales won the match 29\u201316; they went on to claim third place in the competition.He also appeared as a contender in the second series of the British television show Gladiators. He was eliminated in the first round.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
