This led to Chorley having several manorial halls, which in this period included Chorley Hall, built in the 14th century by the de Chorley family, which has since the 19th or 20th century been demolished. Very little is known of Chorley Hall, although according to what the painter John Bird painted in 1795, its location to where it once stood is said to have been where The Parish of St. Laurence Church of England Primary School now stands. There is also Lower Chorley Hall, which was owned by the Gillibrand family from 1583 (later rebuilt in the 19th century as Gillibrand Hall). It is believed the borough of Chorley was not a success in this period because of the lack of manorial leadership and the dispersed nature of the small population."]}, {"page": "John Bird", "response": ["John Bird may refer to:", "*John Bird (died c.1445), MP for Marlborough", "*John Bird (MP for Derby), in 1459, MP for Derby", "*John Bird (MP for Bath) (by 1481\u20131542 or later), in 1529, MP for Bath", "*John Bird (MP for Coventry) (c. 1694\u20131771), MP for Coventry from 1734 to 1737", "*John Bird (MEP) (1926\u20131997), one of the Members of the European Parliament 1989\u201394", "*John Bird (New York) (1768\u20131806), American politician", "*John Bird (footballer, born 1940), Welsh football player for Newport County", "*John Bird (footballer, born 1948), English football player and manager", "*John Bird (racing driver) (born 1926), Canadian rally driver", "*John Bird (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1930s", "*John Bird (actor) (born 1936), British actor and comedian", "*John Bird (astronomer) (1709\u20131776), British astronomer and instrument designer", "*John Bird (bishop) (died 1558), British Bishop of Chester", "*John Bird, Baron Bird (born 1946), founder of The Big Issue", "*John Bird (artist) (1768\u20131829), Welsh landscape artist", "*John Bird (scientist) (born 1955), Canadian engineer, set hang gliding record in 1982"]}, {"page": "Bird (surname)", "response": ["* John Bird (actor) (born 1936), British actor and comedian", "* John Bird (artist) (1766\u20131829), Welsh landscape artist", "* John Bird (astronomer) (1709\u20131776), British astronomer and instrument designer", "* John Bird (bishop) (died 1558), British Bishop of Chester", "* John Bird (New York) (1768\u20131806), American politician", "* John Bird (footballer) (born 1948), British football player and manager", "* John Bird (entrepreneur), founder of Big Issue"]}, {"page": "1768 in Wales", "response": ["**John Bird, landscape artist (died 1829)"]}]}}
