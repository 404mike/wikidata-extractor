The electrotype was done by Elkington, Mason, & Co. for the Great Exhibition of 1851. Among the most spectacular early examples are Josef Hermann's twelve angels (1858) at the base of the cupola of Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia (see photograph A below). As described by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in 1867, \"They are twenty-one feet high, and were made by the galvanoplastic process in four pieces, whose welding together is invisible. They could in this manner be made so light that, in spite of their dimensions, they would not be too heavy for the cupola. This crown of gilt angels, poised amid a flood of light, and shining with rich reflections, produces an extremely rich effect.\" Other important sculptures followed; David A. Scott has written, \"Some extremely important commissions were made in electrotypes, such as the \"bronzes\" that adorn the Opera, Paris, and the 320\u00a0cm high statue of Prince Albert and four accompanying figures, erected behind the Albert Hall in London as a memorial to the Great Exhibition of 1851.\" The statue of Prince Albert was unveiled in 1861 (see photograph B below); the electrotyping process \"was one in which the Prince Consort had had great faith.\" The Palais Garnier in Paris (the Opera) has two 7.5 meter tall sculptures above the main facade; the building was completed in 1869 (see photograph C below)."]}, {"page": "1848 in art", "response": ["*John Evan Thomas \u2013 Death of Tewdric Mawr, King of Gwent (sculpture)"]}, {"page": "1851 in art", "response": ["* May 1 \u2013 The Great Exhibition opens at Crystal Palace, London.
