It was spurred by the 1987 monograph of Mikhail Gromov \"Hyperbolic groups\"Mikhail Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in \"Essays in Group Theory\" (Steve M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75\u2013263. that introduced the notion of a hyperbolic group (also known as word-hyperbolic or Gromov-hyperbolic or negatively curved group), which captures the idea of a finitely generated group having large-scale negative curvature, and by his subsequent monograph Asymptotic Invariants of Infinite Groups,Mikhail Gromov, \"Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups\", in \"Geometric Group Theory\", Vol. 2 (Sussex, 1991), London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series, 182, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1993, pp. 1\u2013295. that outlined Gromov's program of understanding discrete groups up to quasi-isometry.

From the Introduction:\" In the last fifteen years geometric group theory has enjoyed fast growth and rapidly increasing influence. Much of this progress has been spurred by remarkable work of M. L. Gromov [in Essays in group theory, 75\u2013263, Springer, New York, 1987; in Geometric group theory, Vol. 2 (Sussex, 1991), 1\u2013295, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1993], who has advanced the theory of word-hyperbolic groups (also referred to as Gromov-hyperbolic or negatively curved groups).\"Brian Bowditch, Hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the geometry of the curve complex. European Congress of Mathematics, pp. 103\u2013115, Eur. Math. Soc., Z\u00fcrich, 2005. From the Introduction:\" Much of this can be viewed in the context of geometric group theory. This subject has seen very rapid growth over the last twenty years or so, though of course, its antecedents can be traced back much earlier. [...] The work of Gromov has been a major driving force in this. Particularly relevant here is his seminal paper on hyperbolic groups [Gr].\" and the phrase \"geometric group theory\" started appearing soon afterwards. (see e.g.Geometric group theory. Vol. 1.

A particularly important development here is the work of Zlil Sela in 1990s resulting in the solution of the isomorphism problem for word-hyperbolic groups. The notion of a relatively hyperbolic groups was originally introduced by Gromov in 1987 and refined by  Farb and Brian Bowditch, in the 1990s.
