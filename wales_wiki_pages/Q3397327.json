In subsequent works, such as Owen Glendower (1966), Recovery, Reorientation and Reformation (1987), and Owain Glyndwr (1993) Williams documented how English subjugation of Wales was strengthened by the Tudor Acts of Union, and yet still offered scope for the growth and development of Welsh culture.\nIn Religion, Language and Nationality in Wales (1979) he described the origins of Welsh cultural and political nationalism. He wrote equally fluently in Welsh, with his best known works including: Dadeni, Diwygiad a Diwylliant Cymru (The Renaissance, the Reformation and the Culture of Wales, 1964), Grym Tafodau T\u00e2n (The Power of Fiery Tongues, 1984) and Cymru a'r Gorffennol: c\u00f4r o leisiau (Wales and the Past: a choir of voices, 2000).\nWilliams was Vice-Principal of Swansea University from 1975 to 1978, and was also appointed to many committees in Wales and England.

Furthermore, he was actively involved in the Board of Celtic Studies, the Pantyfedwen Trust and Cadw.
