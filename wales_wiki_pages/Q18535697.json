Many of his Yorkist patrons succumbed to the domestic strife of the times, not least after the Battle of Banbury (1469). Later Huw praised Sir Rhys ap Thomas, Henry VII's agent on his victorious march to Bosworth.\nUnlike his contemporaries in north - east Wales Huw Cae Llwyd rarely appealed to monastic patrons. An exception is Cywydd XXI, asking for a mount from the abbess of the Cistercian convent at Llanll^yr (Ceredigion) for Sir William Herbert of Raglan.\nHeavenly patrons however abound: the Saints of Breconshire (Cywydd XLV), those of Rome (XXIX) where he journeyed with his son (in 1475), Jesus and the Saints (XLV). Cywydd XLIV invokes Christ's Passion.\nHuw describes Brecon, its surroundings and the Rood Screen and Cross in the Priory Church (today Brecon Cathedral).\nAnother poem describes a bardic contest at Tretower.\nHuw transmitted his expertise to his son, Ieuan ap Huw Cae Llwyd. In old age he returned to the Dee valley, where he was buried in the poetic cemetery at Llanuwchllyn  (thus keeping company with Llawdden, Madog Benfr\u00e2s, Si\u00f4n Ceri, Ieuan Llwyd Brydydd, Hywel Swrdwal, Ieuan ap Rhydderch and Tudur Penllyn).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Llandderfel", "response": ["*Huw Cae Llwyd (born about 1431 \u2013 died after 1505), poet"]}, {"page": "Richard Herbert of Coldbrook", "response": ["Like many members of the Welsh gentry, Herbert was a notable bardic patron. He was the principal patron of Ieuan Deulwyn, and was also a patron of Guto'r Glyn as well as others. He hosted a bardic debate at Coldbrook House between Deulwyn and Bedo Brwynllys. He was eulogized by Ieuan Deulwyn, Bedo Brwynllys, Hywel Dafi, and (jointly with his brother William) Huw Cae Llwyd.\"Guto's Wales: The life of a poet in fifteenth-century Wales"]}]}}
