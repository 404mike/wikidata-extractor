He showed musical talent since his childhood, winning several prizes at Welsh festivals (eisteddfodau) in which he participated.He studied piano and organ, becoming organist of Mynydd Seion Congregational church, Ponciau from 1894 until 1903. In the next year he took the same position at Bethlehem Congregational church, Rhosllanerchrugog, a post he retained until his death. He took the degrees of B.Mus. (1906) and D.Mus. (1911), both at Oxford. From 1914 to 1920, he was Director of Music at Bangor University.Roberts was one of the editors of Y Caniedydd Cynulleidfaol Newydd (1921), the hymnal of the Welsh Independent Church, as well as Caniedydd Newydd yr Ysgol Sul (1930), the Sunday School hymnal of that same church.\nRoberts was a prolific composer and arranger of hymn tunes, several of which were incorporated into Welsh hymnaries. Among the most well-known are Rachie and In Memoriam, a tribute to Welsh composer Harry Evans.\nHe died in Wrexham, Denbighshire, on 3 March 1935, and is buried in Rhosllannerchrugog cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhosllanerchrugog", "response": ["Capel Bach, officially Bethlehem Welsh Independent Chapel, Hall Street.

The music was composed by Caradog Roberts, with lyrics by Henry Lloyd, who is better known by his bardic name Ap Hefin. The lyrics are a call to battle, as can be seen with the English translation.", "The composer of the hymn tune was Dr Caradog RobertsCaradog Roberts: https://biography.wales/article/s-ROBE-CAR-1878 (born in Rhosllannerchrugog, near Wrexham; 1878\u20131935) and the tune was named after Rachel Williams (married name Rachel Jenkins) of Resolven, near Neath. \"Rachie\" was composed in the first world war, and Roberts says that \"The committee of the Resolven Music Festival requested me to write a new tune for the festival. I went at it straight away and wrote two tunes the same morning. I rejected tune No.1 and sent No.2. The following year the same committee sent me a similar request for a new tune and said how much they had enjoyed the tune I had sent them the previous year... I was extremely busy then and had no time to compose, so I looked up some old mss. [manuscripts] of mine and found \"Rachie\", the tune I had rejected the previous year. I sent it simply to oblige the friends at Resolven. \"Rachie\", notwithstanding the fact that it had been turned down by me, turned out to be the most popular of my tunes. It is named after the daughter - then a child - of the pastor of the Congregational Church at Resolven and is pronounced \u2018Ray-chee\u2019, which is short for \u2018Rachel\u2019.\"", "The name of the tune derives from a visit in 1918 by Caradog Roberts to the Jerusalem ChapelJerusalem Chapel, Resolven: http://eclecs.blogspot.co.uk/2006/07/jerusalem-chapel-1875-1999.html in Resolven. This visit was to conduct a Cymanfa Ganu (a Welsh hymn singing festival) in a large chapel that seated 970 people. Caradog Roberts stayed with the minister of the chapel for that event.", "Dr Caradog Roberts introduced his new tune to the Cymanfa Ganu in Jerusalem Chapel (7 April 1918). Subsequently, he wrote to the Rev R.E. Williams and asked if he could name the tune after the minister\u2019s 12-year-old daughter Rachie. Her father agreed. However, this new tune had a surprising origin. Dr Caradog Roberts wrote the above honest account about his hymn tune \"Rachie\" taken from a booklet of cuttings kept by Rachel Jenkins (Rachie) and now owned by her family.This derives from two interviews with Menna Leyson, the niece of Rachel Jenkins (n\u00e9e Williams), by Professor Colin Baker on 22 April and 20 May 2013. During the interviews, Menna Leyson shared the correspondence that Rachel Jenkins had bequeathed her, including Rachel's notebook containing paper clippings regarding the tune. Menna Leyshon gave permission in that interview for the three pictures above to be made publicly available. Menna Leyson is the current owner of Rachel Jenkins' archives. Menna also became a professional accompanist of the highest repute, not least to Rachie.Further evidence of the origins of the hymn tune derives from a church service in 1982 when a major contributor to this article was present. In 1982, when Professor Colin Baker was an organist at St James' Church in Upper Bangor (Gwynedd, North Wales), Rachie, in person, came to a service, along with her sister-in-law (Morwen) and her niece, Menna Leyshon. The vicar, Rev E.T. Roberts, announced the hymn Who is on the Lord's side? and that the tune would be \"Rachie\". He then explained to the congregation that this would be a special moment as Rachie was present in the congregation, along with her sister-in-law and Menna Leyson (who herself was an organist of that church and a much loved accompanist in Wales).", "Note: The opening chord of the tune \"Rachie\" does not follow the standard harmonisation of hymn tunes. Wyn Thomas, Senior Lecturer in Music at Bangor University, Wales (UK), comments as follows: \"This tune is exceptional amongst Welsh hymn tunes, in that it begins with a tonic chord in its first inversion (i.e. a Ib chord or a I 6/3 chord). This is unheard of in the Welsh hymn tune repertoire because all other hymn tune composers establish the fundamental tonic (root-position) chord (i.e. chord Ia or I 5/3 chord) at the outset, with the tonic note in the bass part. Though Dr Caradog Roberts opens \"Rachie\" with a tonic chord, the 3rd of the chord appears in the bass part. This chordal arrangement gives rise to tonal ambiguity and can cause difficulty during unaccompanied performances.\"Correspondence between Wyn Thomas and Colin Baker, 18 and 21 May 2013.", "* Welsh Biography Online, Caradog Roberts"]}, {"page": "1935 in British music", "response": ["*3 March \u2013 Caradog Roberts, composer, 56 "]}, {"page": "List of Private Passions episodes (1995\u20131999)", "response": ["|Caradog Roberts"]}]}}
