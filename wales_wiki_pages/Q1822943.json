This conflict gives the viewer a rare view of the interior of her parents' middle-class home: one of the few locations other than the Bellamys' home. James is immediately attracted to her, and within two years they marry, after her initially declining his proposal, having been married before to a violent alcoholic named Patrick O'Connor. The class divide between James and Hazel causes early conflicts with Hazel's parents, the Bellamys' staff and in the marriage. In the early months of 1914 Hazel suffers a miscarriage which sends her into an extended depression. During the war she falls in love with a young airman named Jack Dyson, who dies in action. Hazel is particularly close to Richard, Georgina and Rose, but Hudson never truly accepts her, a middle class woman, as mistress of the house. Hazel dies from the Spanish flu pandemic days before the First World War ends in 1918."]}, {"page": "News from the Front", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy "]}, {"page": "The Beastly Hun", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "Tug of War (Upstairs, Downstairs)", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "Home Fires (Upstairs, Downstairs)", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "The Glorious Dead (Upstairs, Downstairs)", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "Another Year (Upstairs, Downstairs)", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "Missing Believed Killed", "response": ["*Meg Wynn Owen - Hazel Bellamy"]}, {"page": "Peace Out of Pain", "response": ["Peace Out of Pain was recorded in the studio on 19 and 20 September 1974.
