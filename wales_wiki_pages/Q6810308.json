J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower (London: The Powys Society, 2008), p. 20. but then, in subsequent years, he generally referred to it as a historical novel, and it was so sub-titled when it was published.W. J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower, pp. 20-21 This description of the novel is supported by a scholarly introduction, or \"Argument\", giving historical background both to Glendower and to the period, which indicates, Powys had thoroughly researched his subject.See \"Argument\" to Owen Glendower (1941), pp. vii-xx (It came at the end of the British edition of 1942), and Morine Krissdottir, Descents of Memory, p. 330. Indeed the novel reveals that \"Powys was no amateur in the academic world\"C. A. Coates, John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape (Totowa, NJ: Barnes and Noble, 1982), p.137.Herbert Davies comments, in John Cowper Powys (Brigend: Seren,1997). p. 125: \"The Argument he appends to the novel shows an awesome grasp of the historical context\". Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1973), p. 107: \"The whole background of fifteenth-century Wales is presented with unobtrusive artistry\". But Welshman Roland Mathias, is highly critical of Powys's handling of Welsh history, arguing that he \"chooses to ignore the heart and spirit of early fifteenth-century Wales in favour of a deep-rooted theory of his own\".\"John Cowper Powys and 'Wales': A limited study\". Powys Review 17 (1985), p. 22.But another Welshman, Meirion Pennar, has a more favourable opinion. \"In Search of the Real Glendower\", Powys Review, 18 (1986), pp. 20-23.
