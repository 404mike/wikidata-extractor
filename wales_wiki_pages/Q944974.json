About the beginning of 1584 he returned to England, claiming to be the heir male to John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer.

He was suspected from the moment of his return. A merchant named Wright alleged that he had seen him at Rouen, and that while there he had lodged with the Nortons (see Richard Norton, rebel of the Pilgrimage of Grace). In 1584 Neville was concerned in William Parry's plot to kill the Queen; Parry seems to have been in communication with him.

After an examination on the subject Crichton wrote a letter to Francis Walsingham, which was published by the Queen's order. The consultation with Parry on tyrannicide had taken place in Lyon, around 1583. Crichton later clarified the point: while the Pope could sanction tyrannicide, he had told Parry that killing the Queen in the hope of retrospective permission was not allowed."]}, {"page": "William Parry (doctor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Parry (spy)"]}, {"page": "Ralph Rokeby (died 1596)", "response": ["Rokeby earned the good regard of Adam Loftus, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and of MP William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, both of whom suggested that he might in due course replace Loftus as Lord Chancellor.

He was also employed on several commissions for the detection of recusants and traitors, including those which indicted William Parry and Anthony Babington. He sat as a judge at numerous treason trials, notably those of Philip, Earl of Arundel, Sir John Perrot, Dr Lopez and Patrick O'Collun.

Parry was an inconsistent Government spy, a double agent who had secretly converted to Roman Catholicism. He was interrogated about his motives and released, but denounced by a colleague a short time later.

He lent largely to Queen Elizabeth, Henry of Navarre, and the Netherlands, and always at a usurious interest; so greatly was Elizabeth indebted to him that the fate of the kingdom was said to have depended upon him; while on one occasion he furnished Henry of Navarre with no less than one hundred thousand French crowns. Palavicino's position as a collector of political intelligence was equally important, and his numerous commercial correspondents frequently enabled him to forestall all other sources of information. He was himself often employed by the government to furnish intelligence from abroad; he was acting in this capacity in 1581. In June he appears to have experienced some trouble for refusing to go to church. In 1583 he was at Paris befriending William Parry."]}]}}
