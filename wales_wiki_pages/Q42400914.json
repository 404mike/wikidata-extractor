About 550 AD he founded a monastery at Meifod. This establishment became the mother church of several other monasteries and was a centre of the order for over one thousand years, and within a generation the monastery had become a centre of pilgrimage.\nGwyddfarch taught Tysilio, who replaced him as abbot.Legend holds that near the end of his life Tysilio talked the aging abbot out of a pilgrimage to Rome.\nHe is commemorated on 3 November.", "link_mentions": {}}}
