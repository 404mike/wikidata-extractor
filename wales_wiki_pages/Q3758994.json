He played for several teams in England, Wales and Italy but finished his career with Magners league side Llanelli Scarlets. He is the son of Derek Quinnell and brother of Scott Quinnell and Craig Quinnell, all former Wales internationals.\nBefore joining Llanelli Scarlets he started rugby in his home village for Furnace United RFC, as a youth player where he played mainly at Number 8.\nIn 2006 he left the Llanelli Scarlets to join Worcester Warriors in a two-year deal. He scored a total of nine tries in 20 appearances in his first season at Sixways and quickly became a cult hero with his all-action displays.\nQuinnell can play at Number 8, flanker or lock and established himself as a powerful impact player for Warriors.\nAfter not being offered a new contract by Worcester at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, Gavin Quinnell was forced to find a new club. He then moved on to Italian Super 10 (now Top12) club Viadana.\nOn 23 July 2010, Quinnell rejoined his former team Scarlets on a two-year contract.Quinnell suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game against Cross Keys on 2 October 2010.
