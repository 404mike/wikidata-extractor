Her family is of the House of Dinefwr.  Nest was the wife of Gerald de Windsor (c. 1075 \u2013 1135), constable of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, by whom she was the ancestress of the FitzGerald dynasty. Nest was the 13th Great-Grandmother to King Henry VIII, King of England, amongst other prominent Royal Family Members.\n\nNest had two younger brothers, Gruffydd ap Rhys and Hywel, and, possibly, an older sister named Marared, as well as several older illegitimate half-brothers and half-sisters. After their father's death in battle in 1093, \"the kingdom of the Britons fell\" and was overrun by Normans. Nest's younger brother Gruffydd was spirited into Ireland for safety; their brother Hywel may have been captured by Arnulf de Montgomery, along with their mother, unless, as appears likelier, their mother was captured with Nest; their fate is unknown. Two older brothers, illegitimate sons of Rhys, one of them named Goronwy, were captured and executed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
