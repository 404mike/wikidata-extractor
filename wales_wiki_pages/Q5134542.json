Davies was a right-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox.  He was born in Pontrhydyfen, Glamorgan.\nHaving spent time on the staff at Lord's in 1969 and 1970, Davies made his first-class debut for Glamorgan against Leicestershire in the 1971 County Championship and in his first game he took three first-innings wickets for 22 runs, but these proved to be the best bowling figures of his career. He made five further first-class appearances for Glamorgan in 1971, and returned in 1972 for a single match against Cambridge University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Clive Davies (1971\u20131972) : T.
