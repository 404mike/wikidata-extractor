His inaugural novel Sorrow for Thy Sons (1937) was rejected by Gollancz and not published until 1986. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946.

Jones founded The Welsh Review in 1939, which he edited until 1948; this journal was important for raising discussion of Welsh issues.

Lewis Jones (1897\u20131939), and Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999), and poet Idris Davies (1905\u201353). Jack Jones was a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897\u20131939) largely autobiographical novel. Gwyn Thomas (1913\u201381) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s.

The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905\u201353), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh \"but rebellion against chapel religion\", along with the \"inspirational influence of English\" poets, led him to write in English. Gwalia Deserta (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of The Angry Summer (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. Rhys Davies, author of A Time To Laugh (1937), and Menna Gallie, author of Strike for a Kingdom (1959) and The Small Mine (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of South Wales.
