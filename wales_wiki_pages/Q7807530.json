Despite this, a number of White Zimbabweans embraced the political changes, and many even joined Zanu-PF in the 1980s and 1990s: for example, Timothy Stamps served as Minister of Health in the Zimbabwean government from 1986 to 2002.", "In July 2002, 92 prominent Zimbabweans were subject to EU \"smart sanctions\", intended to express disapproval of various Zimbabwe government policies.
