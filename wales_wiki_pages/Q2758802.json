While not always evil as seen with the Laidly Worm, dragons were nearly always a threat, and even when they were not, they guarded treasures that man sought, whether gold or water or something else. They had to be destroyed and Christianity, \"the hammer of the dragon race,\" proved one of the most powerful weapons against them because it promised a world in which dragons, creatures of appetite, could have no place. Some saints killed their dragons, such as Saint Margaret, while other saints, such as Carantoc, tamed theirs. Regardless of the good intentions of men like Carantoc, however, peaceful coexistence between man and dragon was almost impossible as the tale of Saint Martha and Tarasque shows. The dragonslayers rose up to destroy them as well. Saint George is the most famous example. A dragonslayer could expect to win gold, women, and everlasting glory, but it was usually a quest for survival. In the end, humans civilized the world and drove dragons to extinction."]}, {"page": "Cadbury Camp", "response": ["Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, near the village of Tickenham. It is a scheduled monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the sub-Roman period when the area became part of a Celtic kingdom. The name may mean \"Fort of Cador\" - Cado(r) being possibly the regional king or warlord controlling Somerset, Bristol, and South Gloucestershire, in the middle to late 5th century.  Cador has been associated with Arthurian England, though the only evidence for this is the reference in the Life of St. Carantoc to Arthur and Cador ruling from Dindraithou (perhaps the hillfort at Dundry) and having the power over western Somerset to grant Carantoc's plea to build a church at Carhampton. Geoffrey of Monmouth invented the title 'Duke of Cornwall' for Cador in his misleading History of the Kings of Britain."]}, {"page": "Cubert", "response": ["The village is named after the Welsh missionary St Cubert who, as a companion of St Carantoc, brought the Christian faith to this part of Cornwall, and to whom the church is dedicated.

After reviewing all the evidence he could find he concluded that Carantoc had been the leader of a band of Welsh missionaries who came to the Crantock district to evangelize it; Cubert was among his followers, and after their work in Cornwall was done they went on to Brittany where a district around L\u00e9on has place-names and dedications related to these missionary saints.Doble, G.

Since 1951 the church has been designated as a Grade\u00a0I listed building.  It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Truro, the archdeaconry of Cornwall and the deanery of Pydar.  Its benefice is combined with that of St\u00a0Cubert.", "A church existed on the site before the Norman Conquest, dating from the time of St Carantoc in the 6th\u00a0century.Lives of the Cambro British Saints, p. 396, 1853, Rev. William Jenkins Rees Domesday Book (1086) recorded Crantock as held by the Canons of St Carantoc's; they had already been in possession before 1066.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 4,25 The earliest features of the existing church are Norman. In 1224 the choir was reconstructed and a tower was added. A collegiate church was founded on the site by Bishop William Briwere of Exeter in the mid 13th\u00a0century. This consisted of a Dean and nine prebendaries.  To this collegiate church were appropriated the parishes of Crantock and St Columb Minor; in 1283 Bishop Peter Quinel united the prebends to make a vicarage.  The vicar was assisted by a curate at St Columb Minor.  However the old arrangement was restored by Bishop Stapeldon in 1309 and thenceforward the dean alone had cure of souls of both parishes, while the prebendaries were probably non-resident.  In 1312 the Pope gave the deanery to a Frenchman; the cure of souls however was entrusted to a perpetual vicar while the Dean was absent.  The endowment of the college was inadequate from the beginning but the economic effect of the Black Death made things worse. Bishop Grandisson in 1351 reconstituted the college as a dean, nine canons and four vicars choral (there had formerly been seven).  Canons who were unwilling to reside could compound for non-residence by paying for the education of two clerks and two or three boys. In 1384 it was found that none of the canons was resident and that the dean was a pauper. In 1377 the church was seriously in need of repair; the canons had the transepts repaired but the parishioners were unable to repair the tower. A legacy of \u00a320 was left by Bishop Brantyngham to this end in 1393 but not long afterwards the tower collapsed upon the nave so that it was ruined. Indulgences were sold in 1412 to raise funds and then a new tower was built at the west end.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 78-80  In 1412 the tower collapsed and was rebuilt. A memorial brass in Tintagel Parish Church commemorates Joan (d. 1430s?), mother of John Kelly who was vicar of Tintagel 1407-1427 and afterwards dean of Crantock.Dunkin, E.
