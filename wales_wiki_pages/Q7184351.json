It was Granville (unbeknown to Williams) that allowed Allam to stay temporarily at the apartment while Williams was away. When Williams returned to the UK after a visit abroad, Allam was still staying at Williams\u2019 apartment. Allam remained as a guest at the apartment for over 10 years. Granville was a hairdresser and owned Tallulah Hairdressing Salon in Coram Street, Bloomsbury, (which was named after Tallulah) and was also an alternative cabaret/drag artiste named Gina King. Gina King went on to win the Porchester Hall Drag Ball one year in the late-70s. Tallulah, Granville and Williams labeled themselves \u2018The Colville Set,\u2019 in a nod to the former artistic \u2018Bloomsbury Set,\u2019 and after the bohemian district of Colville in Notting Hill in which they resided. thumb|200px|Colville Terrace, Notting Hill Gate Many actors, writers and musicians lived in the area, including the writer Charles Glass, and musician Steven Luscombe of the band Blancmange who had apartments in the same house as Iain Williams, and their next-door neighbour actor Bette Bourne, and further along Colville Terrace the actor Philip Sayer. After returning from America Tallulah found the disco scene in London had really gotten big; 'When I came back from New York the disco scene was peaking and it was easy for me to get work. When I had the residency at Scandals (which meant playing 6 nights a week) they gave me a record allowance of \u00a370 a week, which was a fortune in those days, so I was able to buy all the American and European imports I wanted.\u2019 In the late 1970s, \u2018The Embassy was London\u2019s little Studio 54,\u2019 said veteran DJ Tallulah. \u2018The gay night, Sunday night, was the nearest to a chic club that London ever got.
