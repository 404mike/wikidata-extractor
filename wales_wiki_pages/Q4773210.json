The Sontarans plan to terraform the Earth into a new clone world, but their plans are averted by the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). It is also revealed that the race was excluded from the Last Great Time War of the revived series' backstory. In \"Turn Left\" (2008), the same events are depicted in a parallel universe, where Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) describes their plan as foiled by Torchwood (characters from the spin-off show of that name), at the cost of their lives, with Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) being captured by the Sontarans. In \"The Stolen Earth\" (2008), UNIT is revealed to have developed a teleportation device based on Sontaran technology. A lone survivor from the events of \"The Poison Sky\", Commander Kaagh (Anthony O'Donnell), next appears in The Last Sontaran (2008), from spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures. Kaagh appears again in Enemy of the Bane (2008). In Doctor Whos \"The End of Time, Part Two\" (2010), a Sontaran sniper (Dan Starkey) briefly appears pursuing the Doctor's former companions Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and his wife Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), but is defeated by the Doctor before he can assassinate them. Alongside the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), Sontarans battle fleets are seen in Series 5 finale episode, \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010), as part of an alliance of the Doctor's enemies. Series 6 episode \"A Good Man Goes to War\" (2011) introduces Commander Strax (Starkey), a Sontaran nurse who has been assigned this role as a means of making penance. He fights on the side of the Doctor and his allies, which include the Silurian warrior Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh) and her wife, Jenny Flint (Catrin Stewart). Strax then appears alongside Vastra and Jenny in \"The Snowmen\" (2012), \"The Crimson Horror\", \"The Name of the Doctor\" (both 2013), and \"Deep Breath\" (2014). A troop of Sontarans is also shown among Trenzalore's invaders in the 2013 Christmas special \"The Time of the Doctor\".

In The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, Sarah Jane saves the lives of her parents, Eddie (Christopher Pizzey) and Barbara (Rosanna Lavelle) in 1951; by doing so she plays into The Trickster's hands, creating a post-apocalyptic alternative universe in the present day.

Embittered by life (not least due to his wife having cuckolded and abandoned him in favour of her piano teacher), Emrys' path fatally crosses Annie's when one day, enraged by the noise of baby Eve's crying, he bangs on the door and threatens her. Believing that he is one of the vampires attacking the house, Annie herself attacks Emrys and hurls him over the garden wall before she can realise her mistake. Emrys is killed by the fall but immediately returns as a ghost. To assuage her guilt, Annie takes it upon herself to help him solve the \"unfinished business\" keeping him from fully passing on. This proves difficult, partially due to Emrys' manipulative dishonesty, and partially because of his own lack of awareness about the meaning of his life and emotions. For a while it seems that he will have to be accepted into the Honolulu Heights community (although his sly, cynical and lecherous attitudes infuriate the other members of the household). Annie's suggestion that Emrys confronts his ex-wife and resolves the issues of his failed marriage is also unsuccessful, until he finally realises that what he wants to do is not to reconcile himself with his ex-wife, but to vengefully torment and spook her. With Annie's help, Emrys carries out a brief and spiteful poltergeist-style haunting of his ex-wife and her lover, and satisfies his need for revenge and mischief. He subsequently departs into the afterlife through his door, though not before suggesting to Annie that her own \"unfinished business\", when she comes round to doing it, might \"not be a nice thing.\""]}, {"page": "Annie Sawyer", "response": ["In the fourth series premiere \"Eve of the War\" (2012) Annie is worried by George's paranoia and despondency following Nina\u2019s murder. After sacrificing his life to save his daughter Eve \u2014 whom it is prophesied will save the world \u2014 he entrusts Annie and young werewolf Tom (Michael Socha) to look after her. Following on from this Annie and Tom receive a visit from the dying werewolf Leo (Louis Mahoney) and his housemates Pearl the ghost (Tamla Kari) and Hal the vampire (Damien Molony). After Annie helps Pearl admit her feelings for Leo the two depart for the afterlife together, leaving the vampire Hal dependent on Annie and Tom. From Pearl, Annie learns to \"swaddle\" baby Eve meaning both can leave the house undetected. When the sinister ghost Kirby (James Lance) is sent from the afterlife to kill the baby he splits the household up. Annie initially trusts his intent but he erodes her sense of purpose causing her to vanish. However Annie wills herself back and is able to kill Kirby's spirit by touch just as he has a knife over Eve's head. After helping new ghost Emrys (Anthony O'Donnell) pass on through his door after she accidentally killed him, Annie is contacted by the ghost of Eve's future self (Gina Bramhill) who asks Annie to accompany her into purgatory. Annie is shown a dystopian future where vampires rule supreme and humans and werewolves are rounded up in concentration camps and forced into dogfights. Eve reveals that in this alternate future Annie \"faded\" away after watching her remaining friends die. When Annie asks Eve what needs to be done to avert this future she is told that she needs to kill Eve as a baby. Annie at first resists this command, killing Nick Cutler (Andrew Gower) when he tried to kill Eve to bring down the vampires. However, after the vampire leader Mr Snow (Mark Gatiss) explains that Eve's survival will ensure that an effective resistance against the vampires will never form, Annie detonates a bomb killing Eve and the vampire Old Ones. Arriving in purgatory with baby Eve, Annie has a brief conversation with future Eve who fades away, the future having been averted.
