Born in Bangor in 1890 he began umpiring Minor County matches in the 1920s after losing a leg in the Great War. Known for his idiosyncratic stance, as a result of his disability, he stood in 5 Test matches between 1928 and 1930 before withdrawing from the first class list in 1935 to pursue business interests. He was injured in a match between Yorkshire and Gloucestershire in 1927 when he fell as he hurried into position to judge a run out and broke the remains of his amputated limb. He died in Taunton in 1955.", "link_mentions": []}}
