Erbin and Geraint have evidently been switched around, but it is unclear which position is correct. Geraint ab Erbin is certainly a character in the Welsh Arthurian story of Culhwch and Olwen. Custennin is known from other records, but Lud is not and may be a further mistake. Salomon married Gwen ferch Cynyr, the daughter of an Irish prince who had settled at Caer-Goch near St David's in Pembrokeshire."]}, {"page": "Cybi", "response": ["According to the 'Life of Saint Cybi', this saint was the son of Salomon, a 'warrior prince', generally thought to have been a King of Cornwall.
