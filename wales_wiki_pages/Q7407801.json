However they didn't advertise the fact due to traditionalists who questioned the morality. This led to the confusion that Roger was actually Sam Livesey's son. They then brought up the children as one large family, having another child of their own, Stella in 1915."]}, {"page": "Turn of the Tide", "response": ["* Sam Livesey as Henry Lunn "]}, {"page": "Blackmail (1929 film)", "response": ["* Sam Livesey as the Chief Inspector (silent version)", "The film was a critical and commercial hit. The sound was praised as inventive. A completed silent version of Blackmail was released in 1929 shortly after the talkie version hit theaters. The silent version of Blackmail actually ran longer in theaters and proved more popular, largely because most theaters in Britain were not yet equipped for sound. Despite the popularity of the silent version, history best remembers the landmark talkie version of Blackmail. It is the version now generally available although some critics consider the silent version superior. Alfred Hitchcock filmed the silent version with Sam Livesey as the Chief Inspector and the sound version with Harvey Braban in the same role."]}, {"page": "Rembrandt (1936 film)", "response": ["* Sam Livesey as Auctioneer"]}, {"page": "Dracula (1924 play)", "response": ["| Sam Livesey"]}, {"page": "List of British films before 1920", "response": ["| One Summer's Day || Frank G.
