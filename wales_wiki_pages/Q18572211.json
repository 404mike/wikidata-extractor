The ground on which it stands was a malarial swamp encircling a huge stagnant pool. The present town owes its existence as a commercial centre to a local landowner, David Williams of Castell Deudraeth near Minffordd, who in the mid-19th century drained the swamp and dried the pool and constructed many streets. Adopting a scheme of town planning evolved by the builder of Tremadog and his Italian craftsmen, Williams gave Penrhyndeudraeth broad streets and wide open spaces. The main square is a road junction with choice of four roads - one leading to the station, one to Porthmadog, one to Maentwrog and the other to Llanfrothen and the Pass of Aberglaslyn. Williams' daughter Alice Williams built the first Institute Hall for one of the first British Women's Institutes in the country in Penrhyndeudraeth.Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard 28th December 1917, p5"]}, {"page": "1957 in Wales", "response": ["*15 August \u2013 Alice Williams, writer, painter and voluntary worker, 94Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan, \u2018Williams, Alice Helena Alexandra (1863\u20131957)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 Oct 2017"]}, {"page": "Grace Eleanor Hadow", "response": ["During the First World War, she was a member of the War Agricultural Committee and founded the Gloucestershire Women's Institute (WI).
