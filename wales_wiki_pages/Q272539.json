She is believed to have been born in 1630 or a little later at Roch Castle near Haverfordwest, Wales, into a family of middling gentry.The question of whether King Charles had secretly married Lucy Walter was raised during the Exclusion Crisis, when a Protestant faction wished to make her son the heir to the throne, while the king denied any marriage, and supported the claim of his brother, the Duke of York.\nDuring the exclusion crisis [the possible marriage of Charles and Lucy] offered the Whigs the easiest way of excluding the Duke of York from the throne, while in 1685 it legitimized those who took up arms for Monmouth against James II. For these reasons Lucy Walter's short life is important as it explains why most of the political nation considered that a marriage between her and Charles was highly unlikely, but shows too that there were some straws available for the pro-marriage party to make use of.The story goes that in 1879 the Historical Manuscripts Commission discovered an old black box amongst the Duke of Buccleuch\u2019s papers at Dalkeith, which was found to contain a contract proving Charles II had married Lucy Walter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1630", "response": ["* Lucy Walter, Welsh mistress to King Charles II of England"]}, {"page": "Charles II of England", "response": ["At The Hague, Charles had a brief affair with Lucy Walter, who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married.; ; .

Thus Charles II was 16 when he arrived in Jersey in 1646 (he was not yet King), and James, already on the island, was 8 years old. James questioned Marguerite, who denied the rumour. Later, finding a striking resemblance between himself and Charles II when seeing his portrait,M.Pagnol sees in it a striking resemblance between Charles II and Louis XIV (first cousins), referring to a portrait of Charles II painted by Peter Lely, offered to Sir Carteret by Henrietta of England. he was convinced of being the King's son and wished to be legally recognised, like two other illegitimate sons.M. Pagnol quoted the Duke of Monmouth, son of Lucy Walter who obtained this title in 1663.

Charles's alleged marriage to Lucy Walters is heavily contested by historians. On the one hand, much of Charles' trouble with the House of Commons had to do with the prospect of his Catholic-convert brother James succeeding him.  A legitimate, Protestant son would have eliminated one of the major issues in the fierce struggles between Charles and the Commons. Lady Antonia Fraser points out that such a match would have taken one of \"the last aces\" Charles had, his \"marriageability\" to some foreign princess which, conceivably, could have brought him aid in regaining his throne.Fraser, Charles II, page 82 On the other hand, Monmouth's biographer J. N. P. Watson has argued there is a substantial amount of circumstantial evidence to support the marriage between Lucy Walters and Charles, including letters from Charles's sister (a confidante of Lucy Walters) in the 1640s which refer to Charles's \"wife\".Watson, \"Captain-General and Rebel Chief\", 127 Watson has argued that Charles's refusal to reveal his marriage to Lucy was due to James's knowledge that Charles was a secret Catholic.
