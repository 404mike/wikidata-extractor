He played for Cross Keys RFC until 1955 before heading to Hollywood to try to make his fortune as an actor.\nHe had a number of roles, including the King of Wongo in Wild Women of Wongo in 1958. In 2008, the film was given a special screening in Cross Keys, where Richards had spent his playing career; it was the first time the film had been shown in the town.Richards narrowly missed out on at least one role that would have made him internationally famous.
