Woodward (1886), who referred the first known Helicoprion fossils to Edestus, discussed the various hypotheses concerning the nature of Edestus fossils. Joseph Leidy, who originally described Edestus vorax, argued that they represented the jaws of \"plagiostomous\" (chondrichthyan) fish. William Davies agreed, specifically comparing it to the jaws of Janassa bituminosa, a Permian petalodont. On the other hand, J.S. Newberry suggested that the jaw-like fossils were defensive spines of a stringray-like fish. Woodward eventually settled on E.D. Cope's argument that they represented pectoral fin spines from fish similar to \"Pelecopterus\" (now known as Protosphyraena)."]}, {"page": "William Davies", "response": ["*William Davies (English cricketer) (fl. 1844)", "*William Davies (cricketer, born 1825) (1825\u20131868), English cricketer and clergyman", "*William Davies (footballer, born 1855) (1855\u20131916), Oswestry F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Davies (sport shooter) (1881\u20131942), Canadian Olympic sports shooter", "*William Davies (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u20131966), Wrexham F.C., Blackburn Rovers F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Davies (footballer, born 1873) (1873\u20131929), English footballer for Bolton Wanderers", "*William Davies (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131954), footballer for Stoke", "*William Davies (rugby) (1890\u20131967), rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1910s and 1920s", "*Taffy Davies or William Davies (1910\u20131995), Welsh footballer with Watford", "*William Davies (wrestler) (1931-2020), Australian Olympic wrestler", "*William Davies (rugby league) (born 1948), English rugby league footballer", "*William Davies (cricketer, born 1972), English cricketer", "*William Davies (Georgia judge) (1775\u20131829), Georgia-based politician and lawyer", "*William Davies (Pembrokeshire MP) (1821\u20131895), British Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire, 1880\u20131892", "*William Davies (New South Wales politician) (1824\u20131890)", "*William Davies (priest) (died 1593), Welsh Roman Catholic priest and martyr", "*William Davies (highwayman) (died 1689), known as the Golden Farmer and hanged in Surrey, England", "*William Davies (Virginia) (fl. 1770s), Continental Army officer in the American Revolutionary War", "* William Davies (died 1819), English publisher with Cadell & Davies", "*William Davies (palaeontologist) (1814\u20131891), British palaeontologist", "*William Davies (master mariner) (1862\u20131936), sea captain and partner in Davies and Newman", "*William Davies (psychologist) (born 1950), British psychologist", "*William Davies (screenwriter) (fl. 1980s\u20132010s), British-born American screenwriter", "*William Davies (political writer) (born 1976), English writer, political and sociological theorist", "*William Davies Company, former Canadian pork packing firm", "*William Davies Evans (1790\u20131872), seafarer, inventor, and chess player", "*William Davies Thomas (1889\u20131954), professor of English at Saskatchewan and Swansea"]}, {"page": "Dacentrurus", "response": ["On 23 May 1874, James Shopland of the Swindon Brick and Tyle Company reported to Professor Richard Owen that their clay pit, the Swindon Great Quarry below Old Swindon Hill at Swindon in Wiltshire, had again produced a fossil skeleton.

Encouraged by Professor Owen he commenced collecting the rich series of mammalian remains in the brickearths of the Thames valley, comprising amongst others the skeletons of the tiger, wolf, bear, elephant, rhinoceros, horse, elk, stag, bison, ox, hippopotamus, &c. This valuable collection of pleistocene mammalia is now in the Natural History Museum. Most notable in the collection is the \"Ilford mammoth skull\" which is the most complete mammoth skull ever found in Britain. The skull is on display in the Hintze Hall of the Natural History Museum. A resin cast of the skull is on display in Redbridge Central Library in Ilford.
