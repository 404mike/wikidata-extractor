Primarily a fly-half, Macleod also played at Fullback.\nMacleod began the 2010\u201311 season as Sale's fly-half in the absence of the team's first choice, Charlie Hodgson; when Hodgson returned in late September he took over the position. In a Challenge Cup match for Sale against Cetransa El Salvador on 8 October 2010, Macleod equalled the club's record for most points scored in a game by a single player. When fly-half Charlie Hodgson, who previously held the record, was rested at half-time Macleod took over goal kicking. With two tries and eight successful conversions, Macleod scored 26 points in the match. The following month, Macleod experienced what he described a \"highlight of [his] career so far\" when he stepped up to captain Sale in a 24\u201319 defeat to Exeter. Regular captain Neil Briggs was unavailable due to injury and Macleod filled the position. Hodgson suffered a broken foot in December, ruling him out for several months. In his absence, Macleod took the role of Sale's regular fly-half. Macleod's elevation to the captaincy was temporary and winger Mark Cueto was appointed captain in late December 2010 by new coach Pete Anglesea, who replaced Mike Brewer as Sale had won just three out of nine matches in the 2010\u201311 season.Hodgson left at the end of the 2010\u201311 season and the club chose not to sign a new fly-half. This meant that Macleod would be given a regular chance in the position. He had a successful run, scoring 231 points by mid-February when he signed a two-year extension on his contract.MacLeod joined Newport Gwent Dragons for the 2016-17 season and made six appearances before suffering a ligament injury which eventually forced him to retire from professional rugby; he now works as a baker in Cardiff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mitre Sports International", "response": ["*  Nick Macleod"]}, {"page": "Rhiwbina RFC", "response": ["*  Nick Macleod"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 European Challenge Cup", "response": ["| Nick Macleod ||  Sale Sharks || 58", "| Nick Macleod ||  Sale Sharks || 5"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["| 3 || align=left|  Nick Macleod || align=left| Sale Sharks || 231"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 LV Cup", "response": ["| ||15|| Nick Macleod"]}, {"page": "2007 Barbarians end of season tour", "response": ["** Nick Macleod  \u2013 Cardiff Blues"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Glasgow Warriors season", "response": ["Sale Sharks: Paul Williams; Tom Brady, Fergus Mulchrone, Nick Macleod, Ben Cohen; Matty James, Dwayne Peel; Aston Croall, Neil Briggs, Karena Wihongi, Nic Rouse, James Gaskell CAPTAIN, Carl Fearns, James Harris, Sisaro Koyamaibole"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Glasgow Warriors season", "response": ["Sale Sharks: 15.
