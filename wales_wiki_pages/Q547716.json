He was seen as an expert collector of Medieval Welsh literature, but it emerged after his death that he had forged several manuscripts, notably some of the Third Series of Welsh Triads. Even so, he had a lasting impact on Welsh culture, notably in founding the Gorsedd. The philosophy he spread in his forgeries had an impact on early neo-Druidism. His bardic name is Welsh for \"Iolo of Glamorgan\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
