He was just 14 years and 207 days old when the ship on which he was a galley boy, SS Empire Morn, was blown up after it hit a U-boat mine on 26 April 1943. He was previously described by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as \"the youngest known British services death,\" but this was revised in February 2010, when it was confirmed Reginald Earnshaw was actually younger, at 14 years and 151 days.", "link_mentions": {}}}
