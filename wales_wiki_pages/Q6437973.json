He suffered a concussion that kept him out of the game against Zebre on 1 November, but returned to the starting line-up for the Scarlets' two Anglo-Welsh Cup matches that month, before dropping to the bench for the Pro12 game against Glasgow on 21 November, and only after Regan King had been injured in the pre-match warm-up. He was on the bench again for the first two games of 2015, and was forced into an extended cameo in the second match against Glasgow after Liam Williams suffered a shoulder injury early in the second half, and started in place of Williams in the next match away to Leicester Tigers in the Champions Cup the following week. Full-back duties were assigned to Steven Shingler, Josh Lewis and Kristian Phillips for the next three games, but Williams started the next five during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the first of those in a 32\u201314 home win over Connacht on 15 February after making an interception on his own goal line, and another in a 23\u201313 win at home to Leinster on 7 March. A shoulder injury that required surgery brought an early end to Williams' season. During the season, Williams also played three times for Carmarthen Quins in the British and Irish Cup, scoring one try against Jersey Reds."]}, {"page": "The Gospel of Us", "response": ["The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips (Kristian Phillips). He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof.", "*Kristian Phillips as Sgt Phillips: The head of the local police force."]}, {"page": "Hallam Amos", "response": ["Amos made his debut for the Newport Gwent Dragons against Wasps in the Anglo-Welsh Cup on 22 October 2011, aged .
