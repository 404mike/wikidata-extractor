He came to Western Australia in 1896, during the gold rush, and developed the Mount Morgans Gold Mine. Morgans was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia in 1897, representing the seat of Coolgardie. He was appointed premier in late 1901, as a compromise candidate to replace George Leake, but his government was brought down after only 32 days. Leake returned as premier, and Morgans left parliament in 1904, at the end of his term. His career in politics lasted just over seven years, the shortest of any Premier of Western Australia, and only Hal Colebatch served as premier for a shorter period.", "link_mentions": {}}}
