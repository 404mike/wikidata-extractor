After a period as a junior schoolmaster in Wrexham, he spent one term at Jesus College, Oxford, before going to teach at Oswestry grammar school.  He then taught at the grammar school in Carmarthen before being appointed head of a free school in his native area.  From 1800 to 1807, he taught in Dolgellau, where he remained until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tywyn", "response": ["* David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (22 January 1751 \u2013 12 May 1827), poet, from Glanymorfa in the parish of Tywyn is the author of an englyn to his mother Ann Dafydd (d. 1785) which is preserved on a brass plate in St Cadfan's Church."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (1751\u20131827)"]}, {"page": "Dafydd", "response": ["* David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (1751-1827), Welsh poet"]}, {"page": "David Richards", "response": ["David Richards may refer to:", "* David Richards (American football) (born 1966), NFL offensive lineman", "* David Richards (cricket administrator), former CEO of the ICC", "* David Richards (cricketer) (born 1931), English cricketer", "* David Richards (footballer) (1896\u20131971), English soccer player", "* David Richards (motorsport) (born 1952), Welsh chairman of Prodrive and Aston Martin", "* David Richards (rugby union) (born 1954), Wales and British Lions international", "* David Richards, Baron Richards of Herstmonceux (born 1952), former British Chief of the Defence Staff", "* David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (1751\u20131827), Welsh-language poet", "* David Richards (judge) (born 1951), British judge", "* David Richards (record producer) (1956\u20132013), producer of records by Queen and David Bowie", "* David Richards (sculptor) (1829\u20131897), Welsh sculptor who moved to the United States; known for work at Black Hawk Museum and Lodge", "* David Richards (writer), theater critic for The Washington Post, novelist"]}, {"page": "1827 in poetry", "response": ["* May 12 \u2013 David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (born 1751), Welsh"]}, {"page": "1751 in poetry", "response": ["* January 22 \u2013 David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) (died 1827), Welsh poet"]}, {"page": "1820s in Wales", "response": ["*David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) \u2013 Cywydd y Dilyw (1821)"]}, {"page": "1821 in Wales", "response": ["*David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) \u2013 Cywydd y Dilyw"]}, {"page": "1827 in Wales", "response": ["*12 May \u2013 David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr), poet, 76"]}, {"page": "1810s in Wales", "response": ["*David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) -  (1815)"]}, {"page": "1750s in Wales", "response": ["*22 January - David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr), poet (d. 1827)"]}, {"page": "1815 in Wales", "response": ["*David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr) - Barddoniaeth Gristianogawl"]}, {"page": "Bryncrug", "response": ["The poet David Richards (1751-1827), better known as Dafydd Ionawr, was born at Glanyrafon near Bryncrug."]}, {"page": "Dafydd Ionawr", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr)"]}, {"page": "1751 in Wales", "response": ["*22 January - David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr), poet (died 1827)"]}, {"page": "Edward Richard", "response": ["Richard was also an antiquarian, and his correspondence with Lewis Morris and others was published in the Cambrian Register.
