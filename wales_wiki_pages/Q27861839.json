In 1967 he and his family emigrated to Australia. There he published magazines (including men's magazine Chance International and women's magazine POL) and books (including bestseller Now You'll Think I'm Awful), introducing new standards of production quality to the Australian market.\nAfter problems with the importation of Chance \u2014 an issue was barred by Australian Customs on the grounds of obscenity and upheld by court order \u2014 Powell moved his business to Hong Kong where his magazines were printed. He continued, however, to write and publish books, copy, and magazines for Australian and international personal computing and travel markets. During the 1980s and 1990s he also wrote columns for the Sydney Morning Herald, becoming their computer/technology editor and later travel editor and supplements editor. He left the Herald after a September 1994 Media Watch episode identified allegedly plagiarised material under his byline, insertions which, according to Powell, had been made by a junior colleague while he was on leave.\nAfter leaving the Herald, he continued to write books on personal computing, motoring and travel, as well as columns for a range of old and new media.", "link_mentions": {}}}
