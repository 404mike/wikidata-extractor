McCudden taught Mannock about air fighting. McCudden stressed team tactics and offensive use of the aeroplane. McCudden said of Mannock, \"The pupils here during the period of which I write were very good. One I particularly remember was named Mannock. Mannock was a typical example of the impetuous young Irishman, and I always thought he was of the type to do or die.\"Jones 2009, p. 44. Meredith Thomas also met Mannock at Joyce Green in February 1917. Thomas recalled how they were told not to turn below 2,000 feet in an Airco DH.2 pusher. Mannock did so and got into a spin at , deliberately. He was keen to see if he could recover the aircraft from such an attitude. Mannock stalled the aircraft, purposely, and followed McCudden's advice; allow it to come out of the stall and centralise the controls, apply opposite rudder in the spin and as the spin slows ease the nose down. Mannock had discovered that air combat was a science and could be perfected. Regardless, his actions earned him a rebuke from his commanding officer, Keith Caldwell.Dudgeon 1981, pp. 55\u201356.Smith 2001, p. 65.", "Mannock was somewhat older than his peers in the RFC and had experienced the brutality of war first-hand. Meredith Thomas remembered this earned him a reputation as a serious-minded man. Mannock was inclined to be reserved, but was a good conversationalist, patient and willing to assist others but quick to anger. He masked his hatred of the Turks but the intensity with which he carried out his training was sometimes misunderstood.Jones 2009, p. 47."]}, {"page": "1984 in Wales", "response": ["*20 May \u2013 Meredith Thomas, flying ace, 91"]}, {"page": "Loudoun MacLean", "response": ["MacLean was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and after completing flying training, was appointed a flying officer on 5 May 1917.

These were replaced with the Airco DH.5 in July, but these also proved unsatisfactory, and in October they were replaced by the S.E.5a single-seat fighter. MacLean was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 24 October,  and promoted to captain in the Royal Engineers on 3 November.

The following day, 30 November, MacLean shared in the destruction of two more enemy aircraft; an Albatros D.V over Inchy-en-Artois with Lieutenant D. V.

On 9 January 1918 he shared in the driving down of a Rumpler C east of Marcoing with Second Lieutenants A. T.
