The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might have done in other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings."]}, {"page": "Steve Barwick", "response": ["Born at Neath, Glamorgan. Barwick made his first-class debut in 1981 against Oxford University, a season in which he also made his List A debut against Essex. Barwick played as a bowler, at the beginning of his career he bowled as a fast-medium bowler. A mainstay of the Glamorgan side for the best part of 15 years, Barwick made over 200 first-class and 268 List A appearances for the county, establishing bowling partnerships with the likes of Rodney Ontong, Steve Watkin and Roland Lefebvre. As his career developed, so too did his bowling, with Barwick sacrificing pace to introduce more off cutters into his bowling array in the early 1990s, much like Don Shepherd. An effective bowler at first-class level, \"Basil\", as he was known, took 456 wickets in first-class cricket for Glamorgan, which came at a respectable average of 35.49, in the process making 10 five wicket hauls and a single ten wicket haul in a match. He took his best innings bowling figures of 8/42 in the 1983 season against Worcestershire. His most successful season in first-class cricket came in 1989, when Barwick took 64 wickets at 30.43 a piece, it was only the second and final time in his career that he would pass 50 wickets in a season, having previously taken 50 exactly in 1954. Barwick batted as a tailender, but was nonetheless capable of blocking an end. He scored 873 runs at a batting average of 6.76, with a high score of 30.
