She was the family's fifth and youngest daughter, and was known as Dora since childhood even though she was baptized as Deborah Jarrett Rowlands. Jones was strongly influenced by the chapel in her youth and was influenced by a local musician at that time. Educated at the Llangollen County School, she sang soprano in a student quartet and also regularly sang solo. She enrolled at the University College of Wales to study for a Welsh degree from 1908. At Aberystwyth, Jones became influenced by the folk song collector and Welsh Folk Song Society founder member Mary Davies when the latter was invited to lecture at the Celtic Society in 1910. She had begun to sing Welsh folk songs at the college's concerts and also performed in competition in connection with the Welsh Folk Song Society of which she became a member in 1912."]}]}}
