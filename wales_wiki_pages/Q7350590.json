The town of Vaughn, Montana, is named in his honor, and helped co-found the city of Great Falls, Montana.

About  upstream from where the Sun River joined the Missouri River, he decided to homestead. He returned to Helena and filed paperwork to claim the land, and learned he was the first individual to formally file for a homestead in Chouteau County.Vaughn, p. 64.Walters, p. xii.

The five investors planned to turn the Arvon Block into a boutique hotel, with a , Irish-themed bar on the first floor. The bar, to be owned by Thares and Hartelius, would be a franchise of The Irish Pub Co., a company which specialized in building Irish-themed bars. \"The Celtic Cowboy,\" one of Robert Vaughn's nicknames, was chosen as the name of the pub.
