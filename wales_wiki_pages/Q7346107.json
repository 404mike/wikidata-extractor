While serving as a missionary to China, Thomas developed a strong desire to work among the people of Korea. At the time, Korea was closed to foreigners because of the government's fear of foreign influence. Many Koreans had been converted by Catholic priests in the late 1700s, but the government killed 8,000 of those converts in 1866.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Korean Martyrs", "response": ["* Robert Jermain Thomas"]}, {"page": "General Sherman incident", "response": ["Determined to force the Korean government to end its isolationism, the SS General Sherman, an armed merchant schooner owned by an American businessman W.B.

Prior to travelling to Korea, the ship purchased stocks of cotton, tin and glass from British trading firm Meadows and Co. in Tianjin and travelled to Yantai before departing for Korean waters on August 9, 1866. Entering the Taedong River on August 16, the crew made frequent stops to hand out Bibles to Korean villagers. Korean officials repeatedly informed Page that the ship was not allowed to trade in Korea, which were ignored by the crew. Griffis, W. (2015).
