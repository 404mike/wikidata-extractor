By the age of eighteen, he was working on the coal-face, and soon joined the Communist Party.  He was instrumental in setting up the National Unemployed Workers' Movement, and in 1937 he joined the British Battalion of the International Brigades to fight in the Spanish Civil War. In 1951 he became President of the South Wales Miners' Federation, and from 1959 to 1969 he was General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers.  He was also a member of Acas.\nHe featured in a programme in the BBC television series All Our Working Lives, which was broadcast in the year of his death and discussed the changing nature of the coal industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Will Paynter (1903\u20131984)"]}, {"page": "National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)", "response": ["* 1959: Will Paynter"]}, {"page": "Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham", "response": ["As Chairman of the NCB, Robens oversaw substantial cuts in the mining industry, many of them reflecting market forces and government policies originated before he assumed the post. Although he lobbied to protect the industry, his reputation as a socialist necessarily suffered: when he took over as NCB chair there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners, but by the time he left the post ten years later there were only 292 pits employing 283,000 miners. For a while Robens had a constructive working relationship with miners' leader Will Paynter, but he had a combative relationship with the Wilson Labour government. Industrial relations deteriorated during his tenure, and there was an unofficial strike in 1969 that lost \u00a315 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of a walkout by 140 of the 307 NCB collieries."]}]}}
