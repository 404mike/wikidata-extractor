It was falsely speculated that he was an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. \n\"Sir John Perrot, was a figure of unusual power and influence in Tudor Britain and Ireland. Born near Haverfordwest in 1528, he inherited wealth and power \u2013 the Perrots had been accumulating both in west Wales for centuries \u2013 and gained more ingratiating himself with the English court.  His own son described him as a \u2018very cholericke\u2019 man, who \u2018could not brooke any crosses\u2019.  He had already gathered many offices by the time he was sent to Ireland in 1571 as President of Munster to suppress a rebellion.  His methods were characteristically violent \u2013 he hanged over 800 of the rebels \u2013 but he resigned after two years, having failed in his mission.  Back in west Wales he contented himself with self-enrichment and self-glorification, rebuilding in grand style his two main homes, Carew Castle and Laugharne Castle.  He returned to Ireland as 1584 as Lord Deputy, with the task of crushing the Irish and colonising their land.  Again unsuccessful, he returned, was falsely accused of treason by his many enemies, and died in the Tower of London in 1592, possibly of poisoning.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
