Although he gained wide visibility as the nation's \"baseball doctor\", Reese reportedly \"drew no line between rich and poor patients\".During his long career, the Welsh-born Reese delivered therapy to clients including industrial workers, celebrity athletes, and heads of state. His work brought him considerable recognition within the Welsh-American community during his later years.At the time of his death, Reese was regarded as a national figure, and his death was marked by The New York Times, which printed a detailed obituary.", "link_mentions": {}}}
