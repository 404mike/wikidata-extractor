He did not approve of verbose counsel, and would often succinctly summarise their arguments. He was known as a compassionate but businesslike judge.\nEarly in life, he played as an amateur cricketer, appearing in fourteen first-class cricket matches during a career that spanned from 1881 until 1885. Primarily used for his fast-medium pace bowling, Parfitt played for both Surrey and Somerset during this time, and later appeared for Warwickshire in second-class cricket.", "link_mentions": {}}}
