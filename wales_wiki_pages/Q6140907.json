He did not approve of verbose counsel, and would often succinctly summarise their arguments. He was known as a compassionate but businesslike judge.\nEarly in life, he played as an amateur cricketer, appearing in fourteen first-class cricket matches during a career that spanned from 1881 until 1885. Primarily used for his fast-medium pace bowling, Parfitt played for both Surrey and Somerset during this time, and later appeared for Warwickshire in second-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* James Parfitt (1883\u20131885) 6 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Following the departure of Somerset captain Stephen Newton, who played all his first-class cricket in London from the 1885 season onwards, Sainsbury was given the club captaincy. Somerset's first county match of the season took place in mid-July, almost two months after four of the counties had contested matches. The match, played against Hampshire, showed little sign of the troubles that were to come. Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side, but the bowling of Edward Bastard, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second, helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. The county's next match, played two weeks later against Gloucestershire, was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point. Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat, totalling 448 in 190\u00a0overs; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs. In reply, five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks; Sainsbury, Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures. Sainsbury top-scored with 40\u00a0runs, but a team total of 100 meant that Gloucestershire forced his side to follow-on. The second innings progressed even more poorly for Somerset. Sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures, and the team was dismissed for 80\u00a0runs, resulting in an innings and 268\u00a0run loss."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | James Parfitt ", "For their next match Somerset travelled to Moreton-in-Marsh, where they faced Gloucestershire. Bastard did not take part in the match, and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence. Along with his fellow opener, James Parfitt, Winter claimed three wickets, but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets. Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets, and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs. In reply, Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs, before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3. The last seven wickets then fell for the addition of 39 more runs, and Somerset closed on 100, still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs. Captain Edward Sainsbury top-scored for Somerset, reaching his highest total of the season, 40, and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county: Parfitt and the professional, Albert Clapp. Five Somerset players fell for ducks. Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on, Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort, in which Winter's total of 21 was the highest score. A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs, their heaviest defeat in first-class cricket at that point."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1883", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | James Parfitt "]}, {"page": "Parfitt, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Parfitt"]}]}}
