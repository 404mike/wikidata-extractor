He founded the Gwasg y Brython press and was the author of many books and articles about life in rural Wales and Welsh folklore, as well as a series of books for children.\nHugh Evans was a native of the small village of Llangwm, then in Denbighshire, now in Conwy. He attended elementary school before going to work as a farm labourer in his locality. He moved to Liverpool in 1875  where he founded the Gwasg y Brython Press, which became one of the major Welsh publishers of the day.\nHe had wide interests as a writer and archaeologist. He founded the antiquarian  magazine Y Brython in 1906 and in 1911 began to publish an influential critical magazine Y Beirniad, edited by Sir John Morris-Jones.He wrote an interesting book on folk tales about fairies in 1935. He wrote a series of stories and other books for children as well, e.g. Hogyn y Bwthyn Bach To Gwellt. But he is chiefly remembered for his little classic Cwm Eithin (Gorse Glen) (1931), which  portrays the memorable customs and society of rural Wales, largely based on his knowledge of his native area.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
