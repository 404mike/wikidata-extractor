They had contacted composer Chip Taylor to ask him to write a song for them to release as a single. Taylor composed it very quickly: within a couple of minutes, he had the chorus and a \"sexual-kind-of-feeling song\" emerged. On his demo version, Taylor banged on a tambourine while producer Ron Johnson \"was doing this little thing with his hands\", as Taylor related it. The result sounded \"cool\". Producer Gerry Granahan approved the song and then produced the Wild Ones' recording, with vocals by Chuck Alden. However, on its release in November 1965, the record failed to sell, and Alden later said that he regretted not performing the song in the same way as Taylor's demo. The solo in the middle of the song was performed by the recording engineer using his hands as a whistle. This sound was subsequently imitated by the Troggs in their version using an ocarina."]}, {"page": "2013 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 7 || Sybil Christopher || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 83 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Welsh-American || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "New Theatre (New York City)", "response": ["The New Theatre was an Off-Broadway theatre in New York City that was active during the 1960s and 1970s.

The production was a huge success by the time it reached Broadway.
