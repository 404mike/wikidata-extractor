The character was portrayed as a capable, if slightly vain, career policeman with a prickly but ultimately affectionate relationship with Holmes \u2013 as evidenced in the dramatisation of the aforementioned \"We're proud of you\" scene. So familiar did Jeavons become in the part that when he was unavailable for \"The Eligible Bachelor\", Lestrade was replaced by another of ACD's Yarders, Inspector Montgomery. Lestrade's absence was explained as having gone to the Leamington Baths on vacation, and Holmes fumes that he hopes his wife was with him. This is an embellishment on canon, as Lestrade was never shown to be married or attached. In other episodes, Jeavons was given parts originally belonging to other detectives, such as \"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\" and extra scenes in \"The Master Blackmailer\" (their version of \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\"). Lestrade was even mentioned off-screen in the scripts, emphasising his close relationship with 221B Baker Street. Jeavons' portrayal is considered the most faithful to the Canon. In Starring Sherlock Holmes David Stuart Davies wrote, \"Lestrade was played with great panache throughout the Granada series by Colin Jeavons, who humanised and enhanced Doyle's sketchy portrait of the Inspector.\""]}, {"page": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)", "response": ["* Max Quordlepleen: Colin Jeavons"]}, {"page": "The Island (1980 film)", "response": ["* Colin Jeavons - Hizzoner"]}, {"page": "Play of the Month", "response": ["|Nigel Stock,Lee Montague,Charles Tingwell,Jerome Willis,Colin Jeavons,James Bree,Willoughby Gray,George Roubicek,George Pastell,Walter Sparrow,Peter van Dissel", "|Jeremy Brett,Pauline Collins,Edward Fox,Bernard Lee,Arthur Lowe,Andrew Robertson,Colin Jeavons,Russell Hunter,John Rhys-Davies,Richard Kane,David Kincaid,Willie Shearer"]}, {"page": "The Mole (Krtek)", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, the cartoons were transmitted by the BBC with English narration by Colin Jeavons.BBC Genome website - Radio Times listings"]}, {"page": "The Underwater Menace", "response": ["Colin Jeavons later appeared in the Doctor Who spin-off pilot K-9 and Company.
