Wales had won the Triple Crown the previous season, and had already defeated both England and Scotland in the 1906 campaign; so a win over Ireland would give the team back to back Championships. The Welsh selectors changed the team formation by dropping Billy Trew from centre and bringing in an extra forward. Three new Welsh caps were brought into the pack, Westacott, Cardiff teammate Jack Powell and Llanelli's Tom Evans. The Irish played an incredible game, and even though they finished the game with only thirteen men on the field due to injuries, were still able to beat Wales by a five-point margin.

The game ended in a disappointing loss for Wales, with poor selection decisions blamed.
