The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones's Ymadawiad Arthur. The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism."]}, {"page": "National Library of Wales", "response": ["Papers and manuscripts belonging to Welsh authors who achieved their fame during the 20th century have been collected by the Library.

Welsh remained strong in the north west and in parts of mid Wales and south-west Wales. Rural Wales was a stronghold of the Welsh language \u2013 and so also were the industrial slate-quarrying communities of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire.See: R. Merfyn Jones, The North Wales Quarrymen, 1874\u20131922. Bethesda and Dinorwig were the largest slate quarries in the world and the largest industrial concerns in North Wales. Welsh was the working language of the quarries and of the North Wales Quarry Workers' Union. It was also the language of the quarry communities. Many of the leading Welsh literary figures of the late 19th and 20thC had their roots in these quarrying communities \u2013 e.g. Kate Roberts; T. H. Parry-Williams; R. Williams Parry; Thomas Parry; W J Gruffydd; Silyn Roberts; T Rowland Hughes; Ifor Williams; Gwenlyn Parry \u2013 as did a number of leading Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, including Cledwyn Hughes and Goronwy Roberts. Even in the industrial south east, the continuing strength of the Welsh language led the Independent Labour Party in 1911 to include Welsh language pages in the Merthyr Pioneer \u2013 edited at Keir Hardie's request by Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais). Many of the non-conformist churches throughout Wales were strongly associated with the Welsh language."]}, {"page": "R. williams parry", "response": ["#REDIRECT R.
