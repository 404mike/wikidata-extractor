Born in South Wales, he moved to London with his family as a child, and was educated at Christ's Hospital. In 1896 he lived in Dublin for a while, where he became friends with George William Russell. From 1908 to 1930 Morris lived in California as a member of staff of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Point Loma. The last seven years of his life were spent back in his native Wales, during which time he founded seven Welsh theosophical lodges. Morris\nwas a friend of Talbot Mundy, and the two writers often commentated on each other's work in The Theosophical Path \nmagazine.In the verdict of Ursula K. Le Guin, Morris appears as one of the three master prose stylists of fantasy in the 20th century, together with E. R. Eddison and J. R. R. Tolkien.", "link_mentions": {}}}
