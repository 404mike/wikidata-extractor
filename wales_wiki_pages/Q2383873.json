He came to the throne when his predecessor, King Cadwallon ap Cadfan, was killed in battle, and his primary notability is in having gained the disrespectful sobriquet Cadafael Cadomedd (fully translated into English: Battle-Seizer the Battle-Decliner).\nUnusual for the era, King Cadafael was not a member of one of the leading families of Gwynedd. His name appears in the Welsh Triads as one of the \"Three kings, who were of the sons of strangers\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Three Peasant Kings\"), where he is identified as \"Cadafael, son of Cynfeddw in Gwynedd\".Cadafael's reign was a critical time for the future of the Cymry (i.e., the Welsh and the Brythonic 'Men of the North' taken together, exclusive of all others). There was an alliance  of the Cymry with Penda of Mercia initially forged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, and there was ongoing warfare against the then-ascendant Kingdom of Northumbria.\nThough the alliance was effective and enjoyed several notable successes, it would end disastrously with the death of Penda and a Northumbrian supremacy both in the north and in the English Midlands. The kingdoms of Pengwern, Manaw Gododdin, Gododdin, and Rheged would be permanently obliterated. The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, and Alt Clud would be diminished. The blame for it fell hardest on Cadafael's reputation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw (Cadfael the Battle-Shirker) (634\u2013c.\u00a0655)"]}, {"page": "Cadfael ap Cynfeddw of Gwynedd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw"]}, {"page": "Cadfael ap Cynfeddw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw"]}, {"page": "Cadfael Cadomedd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw"]}, {"page": "Cadfael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw", "response": ["#redirect Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw"]}, {"page": "Cynddylan", "response": ["It seems clear both from the poems and from a wider context of known alliances that Cynddylan worked, at least at key points in his career, in alliance with the kings of Mercia: Cadwallon ap Cadfan (d. 634) was allied with Mercia in 633; the Mercian king Penda seems to have lost partly because of the defection of a Welsh ally, Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw (d. c. 655).Patrick Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature in Western England 600-800, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 28; cf.
