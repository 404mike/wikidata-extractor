She qualified as a radiographer and worked in the NHS and is currently the Patron of the Society of Radiographers.\nThe daughter of Ness Edwards MP, she was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001, having replaced her husband John Golding. After stepping down at the 2001 general election she was created a Life peer as Baroness Golding, of Newcastle-under-Lyme in the County of Staffordshire in the same year.\nBaroness Golding was the peer who vouched for the two 'Fathers for Justice' protesters who threw a flour bomb at Prime Minister Tony Blair during Prime Minister's Questions on 19 May 2004. By vouching for them, Golding made it possible for the pair to access an area of the Commons viewing gallery not behind a glass security screen. There is no suggestion that she had any idea of their protest plans. Later the same afternoon, she apologised to the Houses of Lords and Commons for her part in the affair.\nShe is a board member of the Countryside Alliance, a pro-hunting organisation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle-under-Lyme", "response": ["*Llin Golding, Baroness Golding (born 1933), Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme 1986\u20132001Hansard 1803\u20132005, Mrs Llin Golding.
