Her name appears as Margaret, the equivalent of the Welsh name Megan, in several publications. She was recognised by certain sources as the first to experiment with and observe the phenomenon of visualizing resonating sound using a device she invented called an \"eidophone\".  The device or instrument naturally-produced geometric patterns from the resonation of her human voice. As a result, she referred to images as \"Voice-Figures.\" Her work eventually resulted in a 1904 book titled The Eidophone; Voice Figures: Geometrical and Natural Forms Produced by Vibrations of the Human Voice, penned by Margaret Watts Hughes. She demonstrated the instrument for the Royal Society.", "link_mentions": {}}}
