The live group featured American tenor saxophonist Jean Toussaint and was well received by the media, described by Time Out magazine as \"guitar sax-led melodic modern jazz with a poppy/rocky edge\".Harrison released his second album Unfolding in Tempo in 2016. The album features Robert Mitchell, David Lyttle, Daniel Casimir and Cleveland Watkiss. It was recorded live during a short UK tour earlier that year, which received a large amount of attention from the media, including a feature on BBC News.Unfolding in Tempo was released on Lyte Records in October 2016. The release was a critical success with praise from the media. BBC Music Magazine said, \"Records like this don't come along too often...Leader Tom Harrison's confidently uninhibited wailing on alto reflects his three years engrossed in and performing Ellingtonia. His tender solo take on 'Warm Valley' brings closure to a stormy, no holds barred live set.\"Harrison has also worked with Terell Stafford, Peter King, Jason Rebello, and Quentin Collins.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Harrison", "response": ["*Tom Harrison (baseball) (born 1945), baseball pitcher", "*Tom Harrison (cricketer) (born 1971), English cricketer", "*Tom Harrison (musician) (born 1985), British jazz musician", "*Tom Harrison (politician) (1864\u20131944), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "1985 in jazz", "response": ["* 25 \u2013 Tom Harrison, British alto saxophonist and flautist."]}, {"page": "Lyte Records", "response": ["* Tom Harrison"]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1985 in jazz, deaths of Benny Morton, Big Joe Turner, Blind John Davis, Calvin Jackson, Cedric Wallace, Charlie Holmes, Charlie Munro, Chris Woods, Cie Frazier, Cootie Williams, David \"Buck\" Wheat, Dick Vance, Dicky Wells, Ed Lewis, Frank Traynor, George Clarke, George Duvivier, Georgie Stoll, Irving Mills, Jo Jones, Joe Darensbourg, Johnny Desmond, Johnny Guarnieri, Kenny Clare, Kenny Clarke, Leon Prima, Little Brother Montgomery, Lonnie Hillyer, Max Miller, Nelson Boyd, Nick Ceroli, Philly Joe Jones, Ray Ellington, Richard Williams, Sam Wooding, Sandy Block, Shizuko Kasagi, Skeeter Best, and Zoot Sims; births of Aaron Diehl, Aaron Weinstein, Alexa Ray Joel, Andr\u00e9 Roligheten, Camila Meza, Dario Chiazzolino, David Six, Ellen Brekken, Eyolf Dale, Ine Hoem, Jon Rune Str\u00f8m, Kim Johannesen, Kristoffer Lo, Live Foyn Friis, Marius Neset, Melody Gardot, Newton Faulkner, Odd Steinar Albrigtsen, Olivia Trummer, \u00d8ystein Skar, Paul Carnegie-Jones, Per Arne Ferner, Rachael Price, Theo Croker, Tom Harrison, Tore Sandbakken, and Ximena Sari\u00f1ana."]}]}}
