His death was noted by the undated Annals of Wales. Phillimore's reconstruction places the entry at AD 810.\nHis father was Maredudd ap Tewdws.\nThe genealogies of subsequent kings of Dyfed sometimes include Tangwystl, a daughter of Owain's whose marriage justified the rule of their own dynasty.

He says the next important event of history was when Cadell ap Brochfael, the king of Powys, died in 808 and his son Cyngen ap Cadell became the new king. Llwyd notes the next interesting event was a solar eclipse on Christmas Day in 810 and at the same time there was an unusually large death rate of cattle in Wales. He notes also that this was the year that St David's Cathedral was bernt by the West Saxons. Llwyd then records the death of Owain ap Maredudd (Dyfed). He then shows as the next dramatic event in 812 when Deganwy Castle was struck by lightning and destroyed."]}]}}
