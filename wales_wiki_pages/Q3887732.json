His death was noted by the undated Annals of Wales. Phillimore's reconstruction places the entry at AD 810.\nHis father was Maredudd ap Tewdws.\nThe genealogies of subsequent kings of Dyfed sometimes include Tangwystl, a daughter of Owain's whose marriage justified the rule of their own dynasty. However, her actual existence is uncertain.", "link_mentions": {}}}
