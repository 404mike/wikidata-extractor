Would links with a URL format of \"/Archive/Articles/\" resolve to \"/Archive/Players/\" now? I suspect it's an old format, but as I don't have access I can't check.

He played as a middle-order batsman and wicketkeeper in eight matches in 1928 and 1929, and against Essex at Leyton in 1928, scored 57 and 75, the second innings being the highest of his first-class career. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its review of Glamorgan's 1928 season expressed the view that \"Jones may become the regular stumper\". But early in the 1929 season Jones lost his place in the side to Trevor Every and he never regained it. He played two first-class matches for the Wales side in 1929, but then  played local cricket in South Wales before becoming coach at Denstone College and later a publican in Staffordshire."]}, {"page": "Every (surname)", "response": ["* Trevor Every (1909\u20131990), Welsh cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Trevor Every (1929\u20131934) : T.
