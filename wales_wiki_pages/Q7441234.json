Great Britain Performance Director, Robert McCracken said, \"It will be a fantastic opportunity to assess the next generation and identify some of the talents that will be challenging to be part of the GB squad for the next cycle.\" A selection of the event's final bouts were broadcast live on BBC channel, BBC Two and the tournament was sponsored by Betfair for a second successive year. The most notable bouts of the finals took place in the 56\u00a0kg and 91+kg categories as Leeds boxer Qais Ashfaq boxed cleverly to overcome Wales' Sean McGoldrick who had already beat him in a previous bout. The super-heavyweight final involved Joe Joyce and Frazer Clark who landed punishing blows on each other for 4 thrilling rounds, which Joyce shaded by a single point by a score of 37:36. Also, Liverpool puncher Anthony Fowler, who boxes out of Golden Gloves ABC, claimed his second Great British title in as many years with a victory over Tamuka Muchapondwa by a convincing score of 28:14, while 49\u00a0kg Jack Bateson beat Ashley Williams 21:17 to claim gold.", "| Sean McGoldrick (WAL)"]}, {"page": "McGoldrick", "response": ["*Sean McGoldrick (born 1991), Welsh boxer"]}, {"page": "Michael Conlan (boxer)", "response": ["* Sean McGoldrick: Won (3:0)"]}, {"page": "Ayabonga Sonjica", "response": ["Ayabonga Sonjica (born 27 June 1991 in East London, Eastern Cape) is a South African boxer.
