He mainly played his club rugby for Ebbw Vale RFC but as the club went into administration he and fellow Welsh international and club captain Kingsley Jones were sold. He joined Llanelli RFC but as he could not hold down a starting place would later move to Gloucester Rugby reuniting him with Jones, who had joined from Worcester RFC.\nAfter Gloucester Rugby, Hayward moved north to play for the Sale Sharks where he mainly played as an acting fly half.
