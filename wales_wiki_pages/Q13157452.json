It was written around 1500 but survives only in an incomplete manuscript from the second half of the 16th century. The play was entirely unknown until 2000, when it was identified among the private collection of J. E.

The play has no title in the text; the National Library gave it its modern name after consulting scholars of Cornish. The manuscript had been in the personal collection of J. E. Caerwyn Williams, chair of Irish at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. After Williams' death in 1999, his widow Gwen Williams donated his papers to the National Library in 2000, and the previously unknown play was identified by Graham Thomas during the cataloguing process.Lloyd-Morgan, pp. 5\u20136; Koch, p. 203.

David Dumville launched a famously scathing attack on Morris's methodology; and while one of the most influential reviews of the book, by D. P. Kirby and J. E. Caerwyn Williams, described it as \"an outwardly impressive piece of scholarship\", it went on to argue that this apparent scholarship \"crumbles upon inspection into a tangled tissue of fact and fantasy which is both misleading and misguided\". Others, such as James Campbell, were more generous, but still considered that the Age of Arthur was so misleading and full of problems that it was really only of use to professional historians who could sort the interesting ideas from the flights of fantasy."]}, {"page": "Literature Wales", "response": ["The Academi was initially formed as a Welsh language society in 1959, following a public discussion between Robert Maynard Jones and the poet Waldo Williams.
