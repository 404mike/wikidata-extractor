This was put down to the \"attractions of Victoriana\", which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman's Metro-land, was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to have just as much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs."]}, {"page": "John Dunn (radio presenter)", "response": ["After guesting on his drivetime show, writer/broadcaster Terence Pettigrew reversed their roles by inviting Dunn onto his BBC Radio 2 programme Caught in the Draft, a documentary about compulsory national service, which had originated during the Second World War and ended at the beginning of the 1960s.
