William Jenkins Rees Domesday Book (1086) recorded Crantock as held by the Canons of St Carantoc's; they had already been in possession before 1066.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 4,25 The earliest features of the existing church are Norman. In 1224 the choir was reconstructed and a tower was added. A collegiate church was founded on the site by Bishop William Briwere of Exeter in the mid 13th\u00a0century. This consisted of a Dean and nine prebendaries.  To this collegiate church were appropriated the parishes of Crantock and St Columb Minor; in 1283 Bishop Peter Quinel united the prebends to make a vicarage.  The vicar was assisted by a curate at St Columb Minor.  However the old arrangement was restored by Bishop Stapeldon in 1309 and thenceforward the dean alone had cure of souls of both parishes, while the prebendaries were probably non-resident.  In 1312 the Pope gave the deanery to a Frenchman; the cure of souls however was entrusted to a perpetual vicar while the Dean was absent.  The endowment of the college was inadequate from the beginning but the economic effect of the Black Death made things worse. Bishop Grandisson in 1351 reconstituted the college as a dean, nine canons and four vicars choral (there had formerly been seven).  Canons who were unwilling to reside could compound for non-residence by paying for the education of two clerks and two or three boys. In 1384 it was found that none of the canons was resident and that the dean was a pauper. In 1377 the church was seriously in need of repair; the canons had the transepts repaired but the parishioners were unable to repair the tower. A legacy of \u00a320 was left by Bishop Brantyngham to this end in 1393 but not long afterwards the tower collapsed upon the nave so that it was ruined. Indulgences were sold in 1412 to raise funds and then a new tower was built at the west end.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 78-80  In 1412 the tower collapsed and was rebuilt. A memorial brass in Tintagel Parish Church commemorates Joan (d. 1430s?), mother of John Kelly who was vicar of Tintagel 1407-1427 and afterwards dean of Crantock.Dunkin, E.
