He was a member of Mensa International, and created new protests for the Welsh Language Society as the secretary of the first branch, located at Bangor. Owain also sketched the society's logo (a red dragon's tongue) which continues to be their badge and logo. This early sketch can be seen at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth and on his official website (see below). Leading politician Dafydd Iwan says on his website, \"He inspired my generation and laid down strong foundations on which the Welsh Language Society was built.\"\nHis science fiction book entitled Y Dydd Olaf (\"The Last Day\") was described by the Welsh literary critic Pennar Davies in the book's preface: \"Nothing like this book has been seen before either in our language or in any other language.

Since the album was released, permission for an English translation of Owain's book was granted, 40 years after it was first published in Welsh. The album is sung predominantly in Welsh with the final track, Amser, being a musical rendition of a Cornish poem by her father, Tim Saunders.
