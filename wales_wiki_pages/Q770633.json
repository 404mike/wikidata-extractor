(as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate churchChurch buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the fourth century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the twelfth century. Also, as Pearson observed \"Before the eleventh century Welsh dioceses in the fixed territorial sense were not the norm: a major centre of ecclesiastical power, the clas church or monasterium, exerted influence through daughter-houses, and the area of this influence waxed and waned with the power that the local ruler could exert over his neighbours. The term clas, plural clasau, probably derived from classis, meaning a gathering or group of people, a corpus or collegium. Perhaps of monastic origin, such churches were headed by either a bishop or an abbot, and were usually regarded as mother-churches, although the term could be applied to smaller ecclesiastical institutions. Claswyr, or those clerics who normally lived within the church, were usually styled canons; however, this title is a post-Norman usage which reflects the conditions of that period.\" See \"Introduction: The Welsh cathedrals 1066\u20131300\", in M.J.

H. Galbraith, \"The Historia Aurea of John, Vicar of Tynemouth and the Sources of the St Albans Chronicle (1327\u20131377)\", in H. W. C.

His preaching throughout west Wales was attested to in the Welsh Triads.The \"Welsh Triads\" (Welsh Trioedd Ynys Prydein, literally Triads of the Island of Britain) are a group of related texts in medieval manuscripts which preserve fragments of Welsh folklore, mythology and traditional history in groups of three. The triad is a rhetorical form whereby objects are grouped together in threes, with a heading indicating the point of likeness; Rachel Bromwich (editor and translator), Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 3rd Edition, 2006). At the end of that period, possibly being recalled to Brittany, where he was made bishop of Vannes (though it is more than likely that this was a distinct individualAlban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.), he was succeeded as abbot of the church at Llanbadarn Fawr and bishop of the proto-diocese, which was subsequently called, after its first bishop, \"Paternensis,\" by Cynog. It has been suggested that St Padarn himself may have been buried on Bardsey Island, the legendary \"Island of 20,000 saints\".Elissa R. Henken, Traditions of the Welsh Saints (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121\u2013127. Generally, on Saint Padarn, see Alban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102; G. H. Doble, St Patern (Series of Cornish Saints, no 43, 1940); Elissa R. Henken, Traditions of the Welsh Saints (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121\u2013127. But as with any detail of his life, we cannot be certain. Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae is, with Saint Patrick's somewhat earlier Confessio, almost the only contemporary source for this period.", "The anonymous author tells us that Padarn's parents were nobly born Armoricans (Bretons), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach.Maelgwn is portrayed as a tyrant and opponent of the Church, not only in the Life of St Padarn but also in that of Saint Kentigern and of Saint Cadoc. Maelgwn, \"the great tempter of the saints\" arriving at the river Clarach, falsely accuses Padarn of theft and is thereby struck blind but restored at Padarn's intercession, after granting Padarn all the land from the river Rheidol to its source. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch.Unfortunately, church records are almost as poor for this period in the Holy Land as they are in Wales. The Patriarchate traces its line of succession to the first Christian bishops of Jerusalem, the first being James the Just in the first century AD. Jerusalem was granted autocephaly in 451 by the Council of Chalcedon and in 531 became one of the initial five patriarchates. Padarn was given a tunicIt is possible that this tunic was a chasuble, which was adopted by the clergy in the sixth century, though it is said that Jesus himself wore one at the last supper, and its use was limited to the eucharist in the eleventh century. This is plausible, as it developed from the casula, which was derived from the planeta or paenula, a cloak worn by all classes and both sexes in the Graeco-Roman world. The paenula, a cloak similar to the poncho, was an over-dress originally worn only by slaves, soldiers, and others of low degree. Because of its convenience, it was adopted by fashion in the third century as a travelling cloak. \u2013 which later featured in the best known legend associated with him \u2013 and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much of the details of the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, real and imagined.", "In the most celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg forgiveness before he is released. This seems to borrow the story of a different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain).These are a series of items in late mediaeval Welsh tradition. Lists of the items appear in texts dating to the fifteenth and sixth centuries. Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain, ed. and tr. Rachel Bromwich (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, revised ed. 1991). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.Arthur is scarcely better recorded than Padarn. Principal sources include the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas.", "The see, if such it may be called, appears to have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into existence in the years after Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source.The record of bishops everywhere prior to the tenth century is fragmentary. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops \u2013 Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present \u2013 to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion,Sir John Edward Lloyd, The Story of Ceredigion 400\u20131277 (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), p 48. possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol.Lloyd accepts this, and the influence of Padarn in this area, to the almost complete exclusion of St David, is significant, even if we discount the story in the Life of Padarn, that Maelgwn Gwynedd, King of Gwynedd agreed to grant St Padarn, lands \"from the mouth of the river Rheidol upwards until it touches at its head the limit of the river Clarach, and along the length of the same river as far as the sea is the limit prolonged\"; A. W. Wade-Evans and Scott Lloyd (ed), Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et genelogiae: Classic Texts in Medieval Welsh Studies v. 1: The Lives and Genealogies of the Welsh Saints (Studies in Medieval Wales) (Welsh Academic Press, 2nd Revised edition, 2013), pp. 258\u20139. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint's foundation as its endowment.Vita Sanctia Paterni: the Life of Saint Padarn eds Charles Thomas and David Howlett (2003) 33 Trivium.", "Even if much of the history of Saint Padarn and the early years of his church cannot be relied upon as accurate (and there is evidence that it conflates several near-contemporary individualsButler notes that the difficulty with Padarn's history is that we have only one Life, and that a comparatively late one (1120), written at Llanbadarn Fawr. This confusion appears to have occurred due to the use of an earlier account of the Welsh saint, and accounts of the Breton saint who was bishop of Vannes. But it is possible, despite this, that they were indeed one and the same person, given the significant cultural links then surviving between south Wales, Brittany and south west England; Alban Butler and Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: April (A. & C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.), there can be no doubt of his importance as one of the leading evangelists of Wales in the early sixth century, and the ongoing importance of his clas.", "* Vita Sanctia Paterni: the Life of Saint Padarn eds Charles Thomas and David Howlett (2003) 33 Trivium"]}, {"page": "Llan (placename)", "response": ["*Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion, Saint Padarn ", "*Llanbadarn Fynydd, Saint Padarn", "*Llanbadarn y Garreg, Saint Padarn"]}]}}
