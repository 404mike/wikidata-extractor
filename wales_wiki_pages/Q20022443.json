The incident was missed by the officials, and Wiese was not sanctioned during the match. South Africa responded through tries from Wiese and Francois Pienaar, and at half-time led by 18 points to 8. In the second-half, Wales' Neil Jenkins kicked a penalty to reduce the gap to seven points. South Africa then scored three tries in seven minutes to extend their lead to 29 points. A minute before the end of the match, Wales' Garin Jenkins punched South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen. The punch, which knocked out van der Westhuizen resulted in Jenkins being sent off by the referee."]}, {"page": "Mark Bennett (Welsh rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Bennett (rugby union, born 1969)"]}]}}
