His regular position is at full-back, but he has also played at fly-half and on the wing. He began his career with amateur side New Dock Stars RFC, before being signed by Llanelli RFC and ultimately breaking into the Scarlets regional side. However, he struggled to find playing time with the Scarlets and moved to Bristol in 2016, only to return to Wales with the Dragons two years later. He has also played internationally for Wales at under-16, under-18 and under-20 level, as well as for the Wales Sevens team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dragons (rugby union)", "response": ["*  Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "Bristol Bears", "response": ["* Jordan Williams", "* Jordan Williams - Newport Dragons"]}, {"page": "Rugby Aid", "response": ["|FB ||25|| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "1993 in Wales", "response": ["* 20 September \u2013 Jordan Williams, rugby player"]}, {"page": "Jordan (name)", "response": ["*Jordan Williams (American football) (born 1993), American football player", "*Jordan Williams (basketball, born 1990), American basketball player", "*Jordan Williams (footballer, born 1995) (born 1995), Welsh footballer", "*Jordan Williams (rugby union) (born 1993), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 British and Irish Cup", "response": ["|rowspan=1 align=center|  4 || Jordan Williams ||  Llanelli ||rowspan=1 align=center| 58 "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FH||align=\"left\"| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "Jordan Williams (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jordan Williams (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB/FH||align=\"left\"| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "2013 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|FB ||23||Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB/WG||align=\"left\"| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "Judgement Day (rugby union)", "response": ["|LW ||11|| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|WG/FB/FH||align=\"left\"| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "2014 Wales rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["|LW ||11||Jordan Williams", "|LW ||11||Jordan Williams", "|Jordan Williams||1||0||0||0||0||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||\u2013"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Scarlets season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Jordan Williams"]}, {"page": "Jordan Williams", "response": ["Jordan Williams may refer to:", "* Jordan Williams (American football) (born 1993), American football linebacker", "* Jordan Williams (basketball, born 1990), American basketball player", "* Jordan Williams (basketball, born 1995), British basketball player", "* Jordan Williams (Canadian football) (born 1994), Canadian football linebacker", "* Jordan Williams (footballer, born 1992), English footballer who plays for AFC Fylde", "* MJ Williams, also known as Jordan Williams, Welsh footballer who plays for Bolton Wanderers", "* Jordan Williams (footballer, born 1999), English footballer who plays for Barnsley", "* Jordan Williams (rugby union) (born 1993), Welsh rugby union player", "* Jordan Williamsz (born 1992), Australian middle-distance runner"]}]}}
