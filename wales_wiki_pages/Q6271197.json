Senusret I (r. 1971\u20131926\u00a0BC) is said to have rounded up the rebels in campaign, and burnt them as human torches. Under the civil war flaring under Takelot II more than a thousand years later, the Crown Prince Osorkon showed no mercy, and burned several rebels alive.Wilkinson (2011): Senusret I incident, p. 169 Osorkon incident, p. 412 On the statute books, at least, women committing adultery might be burned to death. Jon Manchip White, however, did not think capital judicial punishments were often carried out, pointing to the fact that the pharaoh had to personally ratify each verdict.White (2011), p. 167 Professor Susan Redford speculates that after the harem conspiracy in which pharaoh Ramesses III was assassinated, the non-nobles who had participated in the plot were burned alive, because the Egyptians believed that without a physical body, one could not enter the afterlife. This would explain why Pentawere, the prince whose mother instigated the would-be coup, was most likely strangled or hanged himself; as a royal, he would have been spared this ultimate fate."]}, {"page": "Maurice de Saxe", "response": ["A biography in English is Jon Manchip White's Marshal of France: The Life and Times of Maurice, Comte de Saxe [1696\u20131750] (Rand McNally & Company, Chicago, 1962).

That same month, Heston received the script, but disapprovingly jotted in his journal that \"[t]he love story is very arbitrary, I think; the dialogue primitive.\" Filming would proceed without a finished script and on-set rewrites were frequent. It had been suggested that a native British screenwriter should revise the dialogue for Niven's character for which Robert Hamer had been hired for the task. Ultimately, his services were later turned away as Hamer had sunken into alcoholism. Yordan then recruited Jon Manchip White to help rework the script, but it did not pan out. Four weeks later into production, Niven threatened to walk off set unless the script was rewritten. Yordan ordered Gordon to write \"a Hamlet scene for him, and he'll shut up.\" Gordon then wrote four to five pages of monologue for Niven's character to self-reflect on his actions. The new scenes were sent to Niven in which he returned to finish filming."]}, {"page": "Penguin poetry anthologies", "response": ["Kenneth Allott - A. Alvarez - Kingsley Amis - W. H.
