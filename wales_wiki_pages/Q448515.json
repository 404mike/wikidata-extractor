He played his club rugby for Ebbw Vale.\nIn 1967 Nash was appointed as the first national coach of the Wales national rugby union team. He was appointed to coach Wales for the season, but having won one and drawn one out of the five international matches played, he resigned when the Welsh Rugby Union refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina. Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. He died in 2016, aged 77.", "link_mentions": {}}}
