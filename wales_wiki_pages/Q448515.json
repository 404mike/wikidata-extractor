A number 8 forward, he attained 6 caps for Wales between 1960 and 1961. Nash was selected for the 1962 British Lions tour of South Africa. He played his club rugby for Ebbw Vale.\nIn 1967 Nash was appointed as the first national coach of the Wales national rugby union team. He was appointed to coach Wales for the season, but having won one and drawn one out of the five international matches played, he resigned when the Welsh Rugby Union refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina. Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. He died in 2016, aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wales national rugby union team", "response": ["Wales conducted their first overseas tour in 1964, playing several games and one test in South Africa.Smith (1980), p. 368. They lost the test against South Africa in Durban 24\u20133, their biggest defeat in 40 years. At the WRU annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that \"it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales\u00a0... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football\".Smith (1980), p. 369. This started the coaching revolution. The WRU Coaching Committee \u2013 set up in the late 1950s \u2013 was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and, in January 1967, Ray Williams was appointed Coaching Organiser.Morgan & Fleming (2003), pp. 44\u201345. The first national coach, David Nash, was appointed in 1967 to coach Wales for the season, but resigned when the WRU refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina.Smith (1980), p. 389. Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. Of the six matches, Wales won three, drew two and lost one.Smith (1980), p. 393.", "Following the unsuccessful tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up a working party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team's first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned not to have a coach tour with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.Morgan & Fleming (2003), p. 46.", "!scope=\"row\"| David Nash"]}, {"page": "David Nash", "response": ["David Nash may refer to:", "* David Nash (artist) (born 1945), British sculptor", "* David Nash (cricketer) (born 1978), English cricketer", "* David Nash (linguist), Australian linguist", "* David Nash (physician), Professor of Health Policy at the Jefferson College of Population Health", "* David Nash (rugby union) (1939\u20132016), head coach to Wales national rugby union team", "* David Nash (basketball), former American basketball player"]}, {"page": "David Nash (rugby coach)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Nash (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**David Nash, 77, rugby union player."]}, {"page": "2016 in Wales", "response": ["*27 October - David Nash, rugby union player and national coach, 77Obituary: First Wales National Coach, David Nash, dies"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2016", "response": ["*David Nash, 77, Welsh rugby union player.Obituary: First Wales National Coach, David Nash, dies"]}]}}
