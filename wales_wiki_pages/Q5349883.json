He was born Eirug Price Wynne, in Llanbrynmair in Mid Wales, and educated at Brynrefail School and Trinity College, Carmarthen.  He subsequently made his home in Y Groeslon in North Wales.\nAt the age of 17 he appeared in court accused of not placing an L-plate on the back of his car, as was required in the United Kingdom for anyone learning to drive. Instead, he had placed a similar plate bearing the letter \"D\", for dysgwr, the Welsh equivalent. The eventual outcome of this case was to make D-plates a legally recognised equivalent to L-plates throughout Wales.\nHe wrote 15 books in the twelve years before his death, and won several prizes for his work at Eisteddfodau, including the prose medal in 1998 and 2000 and the Daniel Owen medal for novelists in 1994 and 2002. He also ran a bookshop, Siop y Pentan, in Caernarfon; wrote a column for the Western Mail; and edited Lol!, a satirical magazine.\nHe died of myeloma on 25 April 2004, at the age of 53.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2004 in Wales", "response": ["*Eirug Wyn \u2013  Dyn yn y Cefn Heb Fwstash", "*25 April \u2013 Eirug Wyn, author, 53 (myeloma)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Eirug Wyn (1950\u20132004)"]}, {"page": "2002 in Wales", "response": ["*Eirug Wyn - Bitsh"]}, {"page": "Groeslon", "response": ["*Welsh author Eirug Wyn until his death in 2004."]}, {"page": "Trinity University College", "response": ["Former students include BBC Wales television producer and executive John Hefin; rugby players Dewi Bebb and Barry John; singers Stuart Burrows and Rhys Meirion; Pam Evans, founder of Peace Mala; writers Gwyn Morgan, Eirug Wyn, and John Owen; and David Kitchener, Professor of Inclusion and Diversity, University of Bolton.
