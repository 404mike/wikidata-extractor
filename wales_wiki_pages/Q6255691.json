He emigrated to Australia in 1837, arriving in Sydney on 31 August 1837. He first gained employment as a shepherd for George Macleay and in 1838 he joined Charles Bonney in the first cattle drive from the Goulburn River to Adelaide. In South Australia he successfully managed several large sheep properties and conducted exploration of the area.\nIn 1869 he explored the Stevenson River to Eringa and Mount Humphries; he named the mountains after his children, Sarah, Rebecca, Alexander and John. In 1870 his then employer Thomas Elder recommended Ross' service to Charles Todd, the colony's superintendent of telegraphs and government astronomer. Todd employed Ross to lead exploration of the route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. Ross' party ventured across the MacDonnell Ranges, the Simpson Desert, the Phillipson and Giles creeks and the Fergusson Ranges; they also arrived at the Todd River. In March 1871 he arrived at and gave an English name to Alice Springs, however he found out that the European, W. W. Mills has been there before him. The party eventually made their way to Darwin.\nRoss was employed by Elder to explore between Peake and Perth. He failed due to lack of fresh water. He went on the manage properties in Victoria and Queensland, later returning to Norwood in South Australia. He died in Adelaide in poverty in 1903.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Sir John Ross (1777\u20131856), Royal Navy Admiral who discovered the Boothia Peninsula, the Gulf of Boothia and King William Island while exploring the Arctic", "* John Ross (1817\u20131903), drover who explored deserts, mountain ranges and rivers in South Australia, before later leading an expedition to establish a route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line"]}, {"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| Sir John Ross", "| John Ross"]}, {"page": "Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve", "response": ["::This is the Devil\u2019s country; he\u2019s even emptied his bag of marbles around the place! - John Ross, Australian Overland Telegraph Line expedition, 1870"]}, {"page": "John Ross", "response": ["* John Ross (author) (born 1957), American author of the 1996 novel Unintended Consequences", "* John Ross (publisher), printer and publisher in 19th century Newcastle", "* John Ross (artist) (fl. 1996), British comic book artist", "* John Ross Ewing III, character in the TV series Dallas", "* John Ross of the Inner Temple (1563\u20131607), English barrister and poet", "* Sir John Ross, 1st Baronet (1853\u20131935), Irish judge and Unionist politician", "* John Ross (American patriot) (1726\u20131800), figure in the American Revolution", "* John Ross (1744\u20131809), British Army officer", "* John Ross (Royal Navy officer) (1777\u20131856), British naval officer and Polar explorer", "* John Ross (VC) (1822\u20131879), Scottish corporal of the British Army during the Crimean War", "* John Ross (British Army officer, born 1829) (1829\u20131905), British commander", "* John Ross (British Army officer, died 1843), Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey", "* John Ross (representative) (1770\u20131834), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "* John Ross (Cherokee chief) (1790\u20131866), Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation", "* John Ross (Canadian politician) (1818\u20131871), Canadian Senator from Ontario", "* John Ross (Nova Scotia politician) (1822\u20131892), political figure in Nova Scotia, Canada", "* John Ross (New South Wales politician) (1891\u20131973), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* John Ross (activist) (1938\u20132011), American author, journalist, and activist", "* John Ross (Victorian politician) (1940\u20132003), member of the Victorian Legislative Council", "* John Ross (bishop of Carlisle) (died 1332), English bishop of Carlisle", "* John Ross (bishop of Exeter) (1719\u20131792), English bishop of Exeter", "* John Ross (missionary) (1842\u20131915), Scottish missionary to Northeast China", "* John Ross (American football) (born 1995), American football player", "* John Ross (curler) (born 1938), Canadian curler", "* John Ross (rower) (1945\u20132009), Canadian rower in the 1968 Summer Olympics", "* John Ross (rugby union) (born 1967), Australian rugby player", "* John Ross (runner) (born 1931), Canadian Olympic athlete", "* John Ross (tennis) (born 1964), professional tennis player", "* John Ross, 1st Lord Ross (died 1501), Scottish nobleman", "* John Ross, 2nd Lord Ross (died 1513), Scottish nobleman", "* John Ross (explorer) (1817\u20131903), explorer of Central Australia", "* Charles Rawden Maclean (1815\u20131880), known as John Ross, sea captain and opponent of slavery", "* John Ross (businessman) (1840\u20131876), Scottish retail businessman", "* John Ross (chemist) (1926\u20132017), American physical chemist", "* John Ross (academic) (fl. 1980s), British academic and journalist", "*John Ross House (disambiguation)", "*S.
