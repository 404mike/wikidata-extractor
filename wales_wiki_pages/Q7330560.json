Ten minutes later, he was in a one-on-one defensive situation against Harlequins' second-row George Robson, but the forward was more powerful and scored the try to bring the scores level at 15\u201315. There were no further points scored in the game, but with the other three Pool 2 teams losing their matches, the Scarlets went top of the pool at the end of the first week.
