In early commercials, he would speak the catchphrase \"Wake up, up, up to Kellogg's Cornflakes!\" Dallas McKennon and Andy Devine voiced him. Later, he stopped talking and simply crowed.  The concept of using a stylized rooster originated from a suggestion by family friend Nansi Richards, a harpist from Wales, based on the similarity between Kellogg's name and ceiliog, the Welsh word for \"rooster\"."]}, {"page": "Music of Wales", "response": ["The instrument most commonly associated with Wales is the harp, which is generally considered to be the country's national instrument.Davies (2008), pg 353. Though it originated in Italy, the triple harp (telyn deires, \"three-row harp\") is held up as the traditional harp of Wales: it has three rows of strings, with every semitone separately represented, while modern concert harps use a pedal system to change key by stopping the relevant strings. After losing ground to the pedal harp in the 19th century, it has been re-popularised through the efforts of Nansi Richards, Llio Rhydderch and Robin Huw Bowen. The penillion is a traditional form of Welsh singing poetry, accompanied by the harp, in which the singer and harpist follow different melodies so the stressed syllables of the poem coincide with accented beats of the harp melody.Davies (2008), pg 662."]}, {"page": "Ar Log", "response": ["It is notable that Ar Log's members are drawn from across the diverse geographic and cultural regions of Wales - and from differing musical backgrounds. Dafydd and Gwyndaf were brought up in Llwyngwril, Merionethshire in the northwestern heartland of the Welsh language. They were immersed in the tradition of Welsh folk harping by their tutor, Nansi Richards (\"Telynores Maldwyn\", the harpist of Maldwyn). Nansi subsequently endorsed Ar Log's first album. Iolo Jones is originally from Caerphilly, a former coal mining town in south Wales. Iolo was originally a classically trained fiddler but succeeded in crossing over to the folk genre. Graham Pritchard was also successful in combining, throughout his career, the complex harmonies of Ar Log with the lighter fiddle style employed by Mynediad am Ddim of which he was also a member."]}, {"page": "Catrin Finch", "response": ["During the 1990s, Finch won several competitions for young harpists, including the Nansi Richards Prize and the Blue Riband at the National Eisteddfod of Wales."]}, {"page": "1979 in Wales", "response": ["*21 December \u2013 Nansi Richards, harpist, 91"]}, {"page": "1979 in British music", "response": ["*21 December - Nansi Richards, harpist, 91"]}, {"page": "Robin Huw Bowen", "response": ["He was first exposed to the more complicated Welsh Triple Harp by two members of the Welsh traditional music group Ar Log, brothers Dafydd and Gwyndaf Roberts.

The brothers went on to become founder members of Wales' most prominent folk group, Ar Log.
