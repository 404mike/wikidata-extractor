Some sources say that he was born of British stock in Armorican Domnonia.\nAaron was a Welshman who lived alone near Lamballe and Pleumeur-Gautier, before finally settling in Aleth. He attracted many visitors while there, including Malo, it is said, in 544, and became their abbot. He died soon afterwards. Malo then succeeded to the spiritual rule of the district subsequently known as Saint-Malo, and was consecrated first Bishop of Aleth. Aaron's feast day is 21 June (at Saint-Malo) or 22 June (elsewhere). He is mentioned in Les Vies des Saints de Bretagne.Aaron is believed to have died in the town of Saint-Aaron in Lamballe, France.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
