S. Thomas, was a Welsh poet and Anglican priest noted for his nationalism, spirituality and dislike of the anglicisation of Wales. John Betjeman, in the introduction to Song at the Year's Turning (1955), the first collection of Thomas's poetry from a major publisher, predicted that Thomas would be remembered long after he himself was forgotten. M. Wynn Thomas said: \"He was the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn of Wales because he was such a troubler of the Welsh conscience. He was one of the major English language and European poets of the 20th century.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
