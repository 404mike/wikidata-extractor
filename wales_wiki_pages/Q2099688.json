The band was founded as a side project of the band Public Disturbance, and was part of the Cardiff music scene.", "The band formed in 1997 in Pontypridd, Wales. Lostprophets formed by Ian Watkins and Lee Gaze after their previous band Fleshbind disbanded. They could not find a singer so Watkins decided he would switch from drums to be the frontman and they recruited Mike Chiplin on drums. Mike Lewis (who was also in Public Disturbance) joined a few months later after the original bassist left. Watkins and Lewis were also members of Public Disturbance. Neither member initially left Public Disturbance, although Watkins left as soon as 1998. With Watkins on vocal duties and Lewis (who did not leave Public Disturbance until 2000) playing bass, the band also included guitarist Lee Gaze and Mike Chiplin on drums.", "Lostprophets started out as part of the fledgling South Wales scene \u2014 playing gigs at venues across Wales including T.J.'s in Newport. From there, they went on to tours on the UK's circuit. The band recorded three demos during this time: Here Comes the Party, Para Todas las Putas Celosas, which translates as \"For all the jealous whores\", and The Fake Sound of Progress. These were produced by Stuart Richardson, who joined the band as bassist for the latter recording. Mike Lewis at this point switched to rhythm guitar. The Fake Sound of Progress also included the addition of DJ Stepzak, who would remain with the band for around a year. The first three tracks from their third demo were refined and re-recorded for the release of their debut album of the same name: the title track, \"MOAC Supreme\" and \"Stopquote\" \u2014 the latter two were renamed \"A Thousand Apologies\" and \"Awkward\", respectively.

Originally, Ian Watkins stated he wanted the new album to be \"nastier\" and \"darker\" than previous efforts, with more energy and vibe than before. In a blog post, guitarist Mike Lewis suggested that Ilan Rubin (who subsequently left the band to join Nine Inch Nails) was very much a large part of the writing/recording process. Following Rubin's departure, Luke Johnson of Beat Union was officially announced as the band's new drummer in August 2009. During this time, Kerrang! published a \"world exclusive\" article on Lostprophets, revealing the album's title, and its release date of January 2010. In a later interview with Kerrang in early 2009, Watkins stated that the record was \"the most honest album\" the band has ever done, and that overall the record was \"a lot grittier and sleazier\", while also stating that did not mean \"it won't be catchy\", but that it would not be done \"in such a twee way\".

Both Richardson and fellow band members Jamie Oliver and Mike Lewis stated that the new album would draw upon elements from across the band's three previous albums.

Despite this, the album has still been described as \"poppy\" and \"catchy\", with the \"massive hooks\" the band are known for remaining.
