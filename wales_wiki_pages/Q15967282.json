Credited with 17 confirmed aircraft destroyed before the end of 1943, the true number may be as much as double this as he regularly flew 'off-the-record' while serving later with the USAAF 4th Fighter Group. Dalton-Morgan is credited with six night kills, the most for an RAF pilot in a single-seat fighter aircraft during the war."]}, {"page": "Frank Reginald Carey", "response": ["After medical treatment in Chichester and recuperation Carey was posted back to 43 Squadron but did not fly again for a month. The squadron suffered increasing casualties as the battle wore on. Squadron Leader Badger baled out on 30 August wounded and later died on 30 June 1941. On 7 September 1940 Frank was lunching with other pilots at Tangmere's mess that afternoon while the Adjutant took pictures of the semi-formal gathering sitting in deck chairs and drinking from tankards. That same after noon, Caesar Hull and two other pilots were killed when the Luftwaffe began its first deliberate attack on London, initiating The Blitz. Morale sank and the squadron was sent north to Newcastle to rest on 8 September. Thomas Dalton-Morgan took command of 43 Squadron at Newcastle and Carey flew again for the first time on 23 September 1940 and was promoted to Flight commander, but the squadron remained in the north until the end of the Battle of Britain in October 1940. On 20 January 1941 Carey and another pilot (Pilot Officer Tufnell) chased a Ju 88 out over the North Sea and claimed it damaged before it escaped into cloud.Frank 2008, pp. 77, 79."]}]}}
