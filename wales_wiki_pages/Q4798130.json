Anthony \u00e0 Wood remarks that he had great natural abilities but little or nothing to support him in his studies at Oxford University. He was therefore sponsored by a churchman (\"an ecclesiastical Mec\u00e6nas\") who hoped that he would become a useful writer against the opponents of Roman Catholicism. Wood adds that in his youth he was well versed in polite literature, and later familiarized himself with the writings and arguments for and against the doctrines of Luther and Zwingli.A. \u00e0 Wood, ed.
