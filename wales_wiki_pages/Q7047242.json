He stopped Jeacock in the third round through a technical knockout, and this victory began a string of 14 winning fights. This run, which included a win over Welsh light heavyweight champion, Noel Trigg, culminated in a title challenge against Freddie Cross for his Welsh middleweight belt. Cross and Edwards met at Pandy Park in Crosskeys on 21 August 1957, in a twelve-round contest. In the early stages of the fight, Cross appeared ahead on points but was knocked down in the eighth. Despite this, Edwards continued to chase the fight in the later rounds in an attempt to catch up on his poor early performance. When the referee made his decision to award the fight and the Welsh title to Edwards, after the bout went the full distance, there was uproar from the crowd. Chairs were thrown into the ring and the police were called to settle the 5,000 strong crowd. In the fray, Edward's manager Benny Jacobs, was injured by a member of the public who was attempting to take a kick at the new champion.Jones (2007), p.10"]}]}}
