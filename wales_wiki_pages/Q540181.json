The third is another copy of the Polychronicon, printed by Caxton's successor Wynkyn de Worde in 1495.

The strongest impact on him during these years appears to have been the week's summer school in 1923, which he spent under the direction of Hugh Blaker at Gregynog Hall, the country house of Gwendoline and Margaret Davies, where he first saw the canvases of Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, Corot and Daumier, the sculpture of Rodin and sheets of old-master and modern drawings.
