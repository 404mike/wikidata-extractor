The earlier house had been built in 1767 and was owned by John Llewellin, who married Edmund Traherne of Castellau's sister. When John died in 1786, the estate was inherited by Llewelyn Traherne,  the son of his sister (who had married Edmund Traherne), and Coedarhydyglyn became the principal seat of the Traherne family. The old house was demolished in 1823, although parts remain. The replacement building was said to be \"in the style of Edward Haycock Snr, of Shrewsbury, who designed Clytha House, Monmouthshire\". Its owner, Reverend John Montgomery Traherne, during the 19th century, was a notable scholar and collector of scientific manuscripts. During the 1880s, Coedarhydyglyn was reportedly a breeding centre for the golden oriole.
