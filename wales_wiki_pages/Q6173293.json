It also hired the former lighting buying team of collapsed rival BHS to begin introducing new lighting departments in stores.

The Junior Gaultier outfit was selected by Jeff Banks as the Dress of the Year. In 1988, he also recorded the music video How to do that.

Shaw had lost confidence in herself after her initial fame and had spent much of the 1970s poor after her divorce from bankrupt fashion designer Jeff Banks. As mentioned previously, Shaw later came to realise that she had influenced other people, and this song talks about her perception of herself and how she was seen by others in a more positive light. \"Nothing Less Than Brilliant\" became the second and final single to be released from the album, and later became the title of a 1994 compilation album. Song number two, the title track, is another Shaw/Andrews track. Andrews had originally written the music for Morrissey to put lyrics to, but Shaw ended up doing them herself instead. \"Take Him\", also by Shaw and Andrews, is a tongue-in-cheek rumba/cha-cha-inspired song rumoured to be based on a true incident with Morrissey. \"A Girl Called Johnny\" is the first of two cover versions on the album, and was originally recorded by The Waterboys. Mike Scott had originally written the song about American singer Patti Smith. \"Strange Bedfellows\", by Shaw and Kevin Armstrong is one of the more eccentric tracks on the album, telling the story of a married couple engaged in some sort of gender-swapping role-play. \"Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness\" was written by Morrissey and Stephen Street for Morrissey's first solo album. A demo was recorded though it did not end up on the final product. It was instead given to Shaw who took to the song straight away, and it became the first single to be released from the album."]}, {"page": "The Clothes Show", "response": ["The Clothes Show was first broadcast on 13 October 1986, with Breakfast Time's Selina Scott and designer Jeff Banks as its first hosts.

To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of red blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters \"BHC\" on it (standing for \"Butlins Holiday Camps\") with  white trousers or skirt.

It was written by Shaw herself alongside Chris Andrews, who had written the vast majority of her 1960s hits. Shaw had lost confidence in herself due to bad experiences with the music industry in the past as well as the breakdown of her marriage to fashion designer Jeff Banks and subsequent bankruptcy, and one of the reasons for her comeback was the realisation that she still had fans out there, including people she had influenced musically (including The Smiths and Chrissie Hynde, with whom she had also become friends). The song described Shaw's portrayal of herself and others' portrayal of her. It later became the title of a 1994 compilation, and the single was re-issued as a result, and made number 66 on the UK Singles Chart."]}, {"page": "The Mrs Merton Show", "response": ["| Jeff Banks and Jonathan Ross."]}, {"page": "List of cultural icons of Wales", "response": ["*Jeff Banks, Shirley Bassey, Hywel Bennett, Aneurin Barnard, Aneurin Bevan, Rob Brydon, Richard Burton"]}, {"page": "Dress of the Year", "response": [": Jeff Banks"]}, {"page": "Katie Grand", "response": ["Katie Grand was born in Leeds, England, April 1971 and grew up in Selly Oak, Birmingham.

She always used to wear Warehouse, which had just opened and was really good, because Jeff Banks was still in charge. So there are photos of me aged twelve wearing waist-high tight red jeans with a puffed-sleeved blue sweater and awful hair, and then aged thirteen in an ankle-length black gathered skirt, white shirt tucked in, braces, a black tie, black lace tights, navy blue stilettos and a black beret with a veil.

Chris Poulton was righthand man to Ronnie Stirling and a team of designers worked for the brand. A key survival strategy was to continually drip-feed new styles into stores throughout the season, combining staple fashion items with more outrageous lines to attract attention. Poulton noted: \"Our aim is always to stick to an identifiable look so that people who like us will always look for our label\". By this stage, the business encompassed a shop in New Bond Street, a concession in Peter Robinson and a wholesale showroom servicing 30 in-store concessions nationally, as well as licensing and distribution deals internationally.
