The university's athletic facilities were originally named Lewis Fields after former university president Edward M. Lewis, with the football stadium referred to as Lewis Stadium or simply Lewis Field. In 1952, the stadium was formally named Cowell Stadium in honor of former football coach and athletic director William H. \"Butch\" Cowell.
