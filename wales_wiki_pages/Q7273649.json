Geraint Gruffydd argued that this is a reference to the Phantom Horde of the mythological figure Gwyn ap Nudd.

Ifor Williams and Thomas Parry were agreed in taking it to be Carmarthenshire, but it has alternatively been argued that it can be translated as the earldom of Chester, or, if a variant reading be accepted, the county of Caerleon.  There is also disagreement about the word geiriog, two lines later.  R. Geraint Gruffydd suggested that it was the name Ceirio, referring to a place in northern Ceredigion, and that the thrush was sent there, but Rachel Bromwich considered it to be the adjectival form of the noun gair, and translated it \"with eloquence\".  The thrush's course is directed, according to the poem, i Nentyrch.  W. J. Gruffydd identified this with Nannerch in Clwyd; Ifor Williams treated it as a corruption of yn entyrch, \"to the upper part of the valley\"; and R. Geraint Gruffydd called it an unidentified place-name."]}]}}
