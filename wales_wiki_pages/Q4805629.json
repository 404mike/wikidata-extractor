The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations were used for the wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that \"it felt like we were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues\". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had to make sure that the colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded \"as if I was the biggest sinner in the world\" and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.Torchwood Magazine Yearbook, p. 82"]}, {"page": "Doctor Who (series 2)", "response": ["| Ashley Way"]}, {"page": "Annabel Scholey", "response": ["| Personal Affairs || Michelle 'Midge' Lerner || Ashley Way, Jenny Ash, and James Henry|| TV series"]}]}}
