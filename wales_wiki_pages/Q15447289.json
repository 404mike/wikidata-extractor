His main theoretical interests lie in economic anthropology, religion (especially Eastern Christianity), and long-term history (the Eurasian landmass). After holding university posts in Cambridge and Canterbury, UK, Hann has worked since 1999 in Germany as one of the founding Directors of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Halle/Saale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gift economy", "response": ["Property is not a thing, but a relationship amongst people about things. According to Chris Hann, property is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors' (individual or corporate) \"bundle of rights\" over objects. An example is the current debates around intellectual property rights. Hann and Strangelove both give the example of a purchased book (an object that he owns), over which the author retains a \"copyright\". Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely \"alienated\" from its creator who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator. Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver."]}, {"page": "Hann", "response": ["* Chris Hann (born 1953), British social anthropologist"]}, {"page": "T\u00e1zl\u00e1r", "response": ["The village was studied in the 1970s by anthropologist Chris Hann, resulting in a book \"T\u00e1zl\u00e1r: A village in Hungary\".Hann, Chris 1980.

Also according to the historian Daniel Pipes of Harvard University and University of Chicago, and a researcher specializing in criticism of Islam, \"reports of widespread conversions of Muslims to Christianity come from regions as disparate as Algeria, Albania, Syria, and Kurdistan\", in northern Iraq and Algeria, the conversions of Kurds and Berbers to Christianity are unusually high. According to Guinness, approximately 12.5 million more people who converted to Islam than people who converted to Christianity between 1990 and 2000. According to scholar Ladan Boroumand \"Iran today is witnessing the highest rate of Christianization in the world\", and according to Shay Khatiri of Johns Hopkins University \u201cIslam is the fastest shrinking religion in there [Iran], while Christianity is growing the fastest\u201d, and in 2018 \"up to half a million Iranians are Christian converts from Muslim families, and most of these Christians are evangelicals\", and he adds \"recent estimates claim that the number might have climbed up to somewhere between 1 million and 3 million\". Converting to Christianity is growing among Muslims in the Albanian diaspora, Iranian diaspora, and Syrian diaspora, and among Muslim Maghrebis in France, and Kurds and Turks in Germany. According to scholars Felix Wilfred from the University of Madras and Chris Hann from the University of Cambridge and Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, since the fall of communism, the number of Muslim converts to Christianity in Kyrgyzstan has been increased. Some scholars and media reports indicate that in the Middle East there been increasing numbers of conversions to Christianity among the Berbers, Kurds, Persians, and Turks, and among some religious minorities such as Alawites and Druze. Churches in Europe say that there is an increase in the number of Muslims converting to Christianity among immigrants."]}, {"page": "Keith Hart (anthropologist)", "response": ["*Market and Society: The Great Transformation Today (edited with Chris Hann) (2009)", "*Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique (with Chris Hann) (2011)"]}, {"page": "Don Kalb", "response": ["In addition to ongoing his teaching and research duties, Kalb has held numerous visiting professorships and research directorships across Europe and in the United States.
