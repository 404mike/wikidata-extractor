He rose from humble beginnings as a carpenter to have a major influence on ironworks at Cyfartha and Pontypool and is responsible for the design of early cast-iron bridges.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glamorganshire Canal", "response": ["Almost \u00a390,000 was raised in preparation of constructing the canal and would be linked to any works within four miles of the canal, through branch canals and linking railways. However, during the few miles approaching Cardiff, the canal suffered from severe water shortages, resulting in goods not arriving in Cardiff on time. To solve this problem, a pump was introduced in Melingriffith, with the main purpose being to provide water to the canal from the River Taff. Located not far from the Melingriffith Tinplate works located directly between the River Taff and the Glamorganshire Canal, it was built in 1807, but the origins of the water pump are disputed; historians believe it was designed by either Watkin George of Cyfarthfa Ironworks (1793), or John Rennie (1795)."]}, {"page": "Pont-y-Cafnau", "response": ["The Pont-y-Cafnau (, sometimes written Pont y Cafnau or Pontycafnau) is a  long iron truss bridge over the River Taff in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. The bridge was designed by Watkin George and built in 1793 for his employer, the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, to support both a tramway and an aqueduct to carry limestone and water into the works. A Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument, the Pont-y-Cafnau is the world's earliest surviving iron railway bridge.", "The present bridge was designed by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and a partner in the business."]}, {"page": "William Aubrey (engineer)", "response": ["He worked on development of the Cyfarthfa works, the Europe's largest water system of its kind, with Watkin George. He died 22 July 1827."]}, {"page": "Melingriffith Water Pump", "response": ["Melingriffith Water Pump is a water-driven water pump that was built by Watkin George, of Cyfartha, around 1793 to return precious water from the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works to the Glamorganshire Canal. The water pump is a scheduled monument and has been restored twice since it ceased operation in the 1940s. For many years it was believed to be designed by the canal engineer John Rennie.", "*Pont-y-Cafnau \u2013 an iron bridge designed by Watkin George"]}, {"page": "Old Iron Bridge, Merthyr Tydfil", "response": ["Richard Crawshay commissioned a new bridge and had Watkin George, his principal engineer at Cyfartha and who had also designed the nearby Pont-y-Cafnau in 1792, design it. The bridge was built in 1799 and opened at the end of April 1800.", "The balustrade of the bridge did not form a structural part of it, although it was cast in situ with the main panels.  There were three perpendicular uprights to each panel, with strips forming a pair of intertwined waves between them, giving an 'X' shape in each of the four spaces. These were cast integrally, but had the appearance of wrought ironwork. Three horizontal strips of wrought iron were riveted to the back, to make the gaps in the balustrade smaller, and these appear to have been added later. Its parapet also included 'heart-shaped' motifs at the centre of the bridge, distinctive to the work of Watkin George.", "In 1817, major repairs were made to the ironwork of the bridge itself. William Williams, Watkin George's successor as chief engineer of the ironworks, made a report on its condition and recommended that an iron decking of flat plates should be applied over the existing structure, then a pavement of stone or iron treads be applied over that. The work carried out is not known, but the costs of it exceeded those that would be expected for a mere re-surfacing. The total cost \u00a3354\u00a01s\u00a010d, with \u00a3196\u00a011s\u00a06d paid for castings and \u00a3147\u00a00s\u00a02d for labour. Williams was paid 10\u00a0guineas for his involvement."]}]}}
