Fulford joined the British Consular Service and was sent to work in China. In 1887, when he was a student interpreter at the British Consulate in Newchwang (today's Yingkou), he joined two British officers on leave from India \u2013 H. E. M. James of the Indian Civil Service and Francis Younghusband  of the British Army \u2013 and went with them on a tour of Manchuria. As he was the only person of the three Brits who had a China background, he provided the British party with a language and cultural expertise.Fulford served for a number of years in the British consulate in Newchwang. He became the consul there in 1899, and served in that position during the Boxer Uprising and the Russo-Japanese War, informing the British governments on the events as they developed.\nHe was appointed CMG in the 1900 Birthday Honours.
