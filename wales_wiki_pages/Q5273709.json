In one match against New South Wales the referee left the field in disgust at the players' persistent fighting after 56 minutes so the match was abandoned. The first Test was held at the SCG, Sydney and was won by Australia. 47,096 people attended the Great Britain versus Australia Test on 3 July 1954 held at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, this is still the ground attendance record for any sport. The most famous incident of the tour took place on Saturday 10 July, the weekend before the third Test with the series level at one win each, the Great Britain management decided to rest most of their Test players and field a side which was predominantly made up of forwards for the game against New South Wales. The match was an exceptionally brutal affair and was abandoned in the second half after a brawl between all 26 players. Great Britain lost the deciding third Test 20\u201316 in Sydney in front of 67,577 fans."]}, {"page": "Richard Williams", "response": ["* Dickie Williams (1925\u20131997), Welsh rugby union and rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* Dickie Williams circa-1948"]}]}}
