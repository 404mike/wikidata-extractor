In 1986, as Persian Risk disbanded, he was recruited by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to front the Geezer Butler Band  but the group ultimately failed to score a record deal. In 1990, he was sought out by Welsh guitarist Paul Chapman of Lone Star, UFO, and Waysted fame to front a new band, Ghost, in Orlando, Florida. It too never got off the ground properly and was mostly ignored by the industry  (although an archives release was put together posthumously by Chapman). Sentance also assembled an American version of Persian Risk with guitarist Mark Lanoue; the band gigged in the Southern US area until their demise in 1995. Back in the UK, the singer was involved in a project with members of Wraith before being asked to front legendary Swiss hard rockers Krokus in 1998; he appeared on their Round 13 album and stayed on for the next three years. In 2005, Sentance emerged fronting Whole Lotta Metal alongside co-vocalist Tony Martin of Black Sabbath fame and other British metal session musicians, assembled for a touring cast of cover versions. The singer also served as the voice for the Power Project who issued the Dinosaurs album in 2006. It featured Sentance and veteran US musicians Carlos Cavazo (Quiet Riot, Ratt), Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Dio, Foreigner), and Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Dio). On the live front, the singer teamed up with Deep Purple's Don Airey & Friends and can also be heard on Airey's 2008 solo effort, A Light in the Sky, and also on Airey\u00b4s 2008 album, One of a Kind, where he is the lead vocalist on all songs.

Welsh vocalist Carl Sentance (ex-Persian Risk, Geezer Butler Band) joined the band for Round 13, with Haas returning on drums.  In 2003, the band released Rock the Block with the new line-up of Marc Storace on vocals, Fernando von Arb on lead guitar, bass and keyboards, Dominique Favez on rhythm and lead guitar, Tony Castell on bass and rhythm guitar, and Patrick Aeby on drums and percussion.

The brainchild of ex-Stoned Soul Party guitarist Phil Campbell, he recruited vocalist Jon Deverill, second guitarist Dave Bell, bass player Nick Hughes, and drummer Razz. The group was active until 1986. In 2012, the band was re-activated by vocalist Carl Sentance albeit without the involvement of any other past members.", "In late 1980, Deverill was headhunted by the Tygers of Pan Tang and replaced by Carl Sentance, a former bandmate of Nick Hughes and Razz in Leading Star. New vocalist in place, Persian Risk issued the now highly collectible \"Calling For You\" b/w \"Chase the Dragon\" 7\" single in 1981, before sacking Dave Bell's replacement, Alex Lohfink, and soldiering on as a four-piece.  The band made further headway by contributing the aforementioned \"Calling For You\" to  the \"Heavy Metal Heroes Vol. 2\" compilation album (Heavy Metal Records, 1982) and a new cut, \"50.000 Stallions\", to the 60 Minutes Plus cassette compilation (Neat Records, 1982), also issued on vinyl as All Hell Let Loose by Neat in conjunction with Italy's Base Records label in 1983. Adding to their tally, the band followed it up with the \"Ridin' High\" b/w \"Hurt You\" single through Neat, which earned Risk their strongest reviews yet.", "That same year, Persian Risk made their one and only national UK TV appearance when the band performed three songs - \"Women In Rock\", \"Rise Up\", and \"Too Different\" - on Channel 4's ECT program. All three songs would later feature on their Rise Up album, which was released in 1986 on Metal Masters. By that time, the band had already disintegrated, the result of mounting frustration after years of hard work and failing to get that elusive big break.  Nick Hughes exited to join Idol Rich, drummer Steve Hopgood co-founded Wild! (and later joined Paul Di'Anno's Battlezone and Killers, as well as an early version of Jagged Edge), while Carl Sentance stepped in with Tokyo Blade on their 1986 European tour; he was also brought in as a guest vocalist by fellow Welsh act Tredegar for their 1986 debut album. Graham Bath, too, would later serve a stint with the DiAnno fronted Battlezone and Killers.", "In February 2012, vocalist Carl Sentance announced on his Facebook page that he had recorded seven new songs, and re-cut four old Persian Risk tracks, for inclusion on a new Persian Risk album, albeit without any of the original members involved.
