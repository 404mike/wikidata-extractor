Born and raised on Anglesey, he attended Bangor University and went on to study for his doctorate at University of Alberta, Canada. Prior to his work on the breathalyser at Lion Laboratories, he was a lecturer at the Royal Military College of Science and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. He established the Dr Tom Parry Jones Endowment Fund at Bangor University in 2002. After selling Lion Laboratories in 2005, he set up PPM Technology and Welsh Dragon Aviation. A trust was set up in his, and his wife's, names. The Tom and Raj Jones Trust promotes work by young entrepreneurs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 11", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Tom Parry Jones, Welsh chemist, invented the breathalyzer (b. 1935)"]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["*Tom Parry Jones (1935\u20132013), UK \u2013 first electronic Breathalyzer"]}, {"page": "Breathalyzer", "response": ["In 1967 in Britain, Bill Ducie and Tom Parry Jones developed and marketed the first electronic breathalyser. They established Lion Laboratories in Cardiff. Ducie was a chartered electrical engineer, and Tom Parry Jones was a lecturer at UWIST.   The Road Safety Act 1967 introduced the first legally enforceable maximum blood alcohol level for drivers in the UK, above which it became an offence to be in charge of a motor vehicle; and introduced the roadside breathalyser, made available to police forces across the country.  In 1979, Lion Laboratories' version of the breathalyser, known as the Alcolyser and incorporating crystal-filled tubes that changed colour above a certain level of alcohol in the breath, was approved for police use. Lion Laboratories won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for the product in 1980, and it began to be marketed worldwide. The Alcolyser was superseded by the Lion Intoximeter 3000 in 1983, and later by the Lion Alcolmeter and Lion Intoxilyser.  These later models used a fuel cell alcohol sensor rather than crystals, providing a more reliable curbside test and removing the need for blood or urine samples to be taken at a police station.  In 1991, Lion Laboratories was sold to the American company MPD, Inc."]}, {"page": "Parry Jones", "response": ["*Tom Parry Jones (1935\u20132013), Welsh scientist and inventor"]}, {"page": "1935 in Wales", "response": ["*27 March \u2013 Tom Parry Jones, inventor (died 2013)"]}, {"page": "Bangor University", "response": ["File:Tom -gt.jones.jpg|Tom Parry Jones", "* Tom Parry Jones, scientist, developer of the first handheld electronic breathalyser"]}, {"page": "Tom Jones", "response": ["*Tom Parry Jones (1935\u20132013), Welsh scientist, inventor and entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Tom Parry Jones, 77, inventor (electronic breathalyser)."]}, {"page": "2013 in Wales", "response": ["*11 January \u2013 Tom Parry Jones, inventor of the electronic breathalyser, 77"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2013", "response": ["*Tom Parry Jones, 77, Welsh inventor (electronic breathalyser)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Parry Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Parry Jones"]}]}}
