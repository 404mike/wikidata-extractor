The family continued to be prominent in politics, all the baronets save Owen sat as Members of Parliament, often for Carnarvon or Carnarvonshire. This creation became extinct in 1719, on the death of the fifth baronet. Wynnstay, near Ruabon, passed to Jane Thelwell and her husband Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet, who added the surname Wynn to his own in honor of his wife's princely heritage (see Williams-Wynn baronets). Mary Wynn, only child and heiress of the fourth Baronet, was the wife of Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.

At the age of sixteen he enrolled at William Shipley's drawing academy, later becoming a pupil to Joshua Reynolds. In late 1769 or early 1770 he returned to Wales, where the Wynnstay estate had lately been inherited by the third baronet's son, an art lover who had just returned from his Grand Tour. He also received commissions for chalk and painted portraits from others in the Welsh gentry. Sir Watkin funded Parry's own Grand Tour in 1770\u20135, during which he produced full-scale copies of paintings by Raphael and Correggio. In 1776 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, having exhibited five portraits in that year's Summer Exhibition. In around 1775\u20136, he painted the Portrait of Omai with Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, one of his most celebrated works. In 1779 Parry's wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Keene) died in childbirth. In 1789 Parry returned to Italy, according to James Northcote, \"to seek employment in art, in addition to the wish of stifling the regret for the loss of an amiable wife\". After a sudden decline in his health, he returned to London, where he died in 1791, aged 47."]}]}}
