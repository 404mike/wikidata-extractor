Thomas was already giving his Sundays to preaching, and was prevailed upon to give up his business prospects in order to devote himself wholly to the ministry. He entered Newport Pagnell College to prepare for the ministry, and afterwards became pastor at Chesham. In 1844, he moved to Stockwell, London, where he ministered to a congregation reaching up to 900 people until his retirement in 1877. He began publication of The Homilist in 1852, and proceeded to publish over forty volumes. He also wrote The Crisis of Being\u2014six lectures to Young Men on Religious Decision; The Progress of Being; The Genius of the Gospels; A Commentary on the Gospel of St. Matthew; The Practical Philosopher; Problemata Mnndi, and other works. His collected writings eventually filled nine volumes, republished between 1882 and 1889.Thomas was the originator of the Working Men's Club and Institute, of which Lord Brougham was first president; and of an insurance plan for the benefit of widows of ministers. His congregants included Catherine Mumford (whose wedding to William Booth was officiated by Thomas in 1855) and Wilson Carlile. Pennsylvania's Waynesburg College awarded Thomas an Honorary Doctorate, recognizing his efforts to reconcile the churches of the United States and England.\nHe died at his daughter's home in Ramsgate on 30 December 1894 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Thomas", "response": ["* David Thomas (composer) (1881\u20131928), Welsh composer", "* David Thomas (musician) (born 1953), American musician, member of group Pere Ubu", "* David Thomas (Dewi Hefin) (1828\u20131909), Welsh poet and schoolteacher", "* David Thomas (bass) (born 1943), British early-music and baroque-music singer", "* David Thomas (born 1959), English author, better known under his pen name Tom Cain", "* David Thomas, pen name of Dave Thompson (author) (born 1960), English writer about music", "* David Thomas (born 1966), musician with Take 6", "* David Thomas (British businessman) (born 1963), British businessman, CEO of Barratt Developments", "* David Thomas (industrialist) (1794\u20131882), Welsh industrialist", "* David Thomas (New York politician) (1762\u20131831), American politician, Congressman from New York", "* David Thomas (Texas politician) (1795\u20131836), American politician, signer of Texas Declaration of Independence", "* David Thomas (British politician) (1892\u20131954), Welsh Labour politician", "* David Thomas (MEP) (born 1955), British Labour politician", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Montgomery) (1833\u20131916), Welsh priest and historian", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Cardigan) (died 1951), Welsh priest", "* David Thomas (missionary priest) (1829\u20131905), Welsh priest", "* David Thomas (Protestant minister, born 1813) (1813\u20131894), Welsh preacher and publisher", "* David Thomas (bishop) (1942\u20132017), Welsh bishop, Provincial Assistant Bishop for the Church in Wales", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Gower), Welsh Anglican priest", "* David Thomas (Canadian scientist), Canadian biochemist", "* David Thomas (geographer) (born 1958), British geographer", "* David Thomas (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s for Wales, Halifax, and Mid-Rhondda", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1911) (1911\u20132001), Welsh cricketer", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1959) (1959\u20132012), English cricketer", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1963), former English cricketer", "* David Thomas (American football) (born 1983), American football player", "* David Thomas (Canadian football) (born 1951), American football cornerback", "* David Thomas (beach volleyball) (born 1974), Trinidad and Tobago beach volleyball player", "* David Thomas (boxer) (born 1937), British Olympic boxer", "* David Thomas (field hockey) (born 1927), British Olympic hockey player", "* David Thomas (educationalist) (1880\u20131967), Welsh educationalist and politician", "* David Thomas (murderer) (died 1995), executed Vincentian criminal", "* David Thomas (jeweller) (born 1942), Crown Jeweller for the English monarchy", "* David Thomas (judge), Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland", "* J.
