There are twin Corinthian columns with embossed shafts, acanthus frieze, cornice with flaming urns, and the Duke's arms and supporters. At the top, 25\u00a0ft from the ground, is a tasseled cushion supporting a coronet; on the plinth are full-length female figures of Justice and Truth.

There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham.Tincey, 2005 pages 61\u201367 These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity than there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he would probably have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.Tincey, 2005 pages 64\u201367Dunning, 1984 page 28Wyndham, 1976 pages 139\u2013141Clarke, 1985 page 24Earle, 1977 pages 97\u201398Sawers, 2007 pages 12\u201313"]}, {"page": "Duke of Beaufort", "response": ["*Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort (1629\u20131700), eldest son of the 2nd Marquess"]}, {"page": "Baron Herbert", "response": ["*Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, 9th Baron Herbert (1629\u20131700)"]}, {"page": "Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester", "response": ["**Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, his heir and successor, who was created Duke of Beaufort;"]}, {"page": "Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester", "response": ["He was the eldest surviving son of Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort and Mary Capell, and was styled Lord Herbert of Raglan from 1667 until 1682 and Marquess of Worcester thereafter.
