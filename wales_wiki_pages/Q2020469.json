He spent two years playing on the PGA EuroPro Tour and a further three on the Challenge Tour, where he won for the first time in 2006. This helped him to fifth place in the rankings, earning him a place on the European Tour for 2007. Sullivan ended his debut year 131st in the Order of Merit, just outside the players who automatically retained their cards, but he still gained entry to several events in 2008. Since 2009, he has returned to the Challenge Tour full-time.\nIn 2008, Sullivan also won the South Wales Open.", "link_mentions": {}}}
