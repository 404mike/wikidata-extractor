Some sources give her name as Agnes Maria Bennett. She had two children, and she taught her daughter to act. She became a noted stage actor. Her best-known work is the epistolary novel Agnes de-Courci (1789).\nShe worked as the housekeeper of Thomas Pye, and was also her employer's mistress. They had two illegitimate children. Their most notable child was the actress Harriet Pye Esten.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1808", "response": ["* February 12 \u2013 Anna Maria Bennett, English novelist (d. 1750)"]}, {"page": "1808 in literature", "response": ["*February 12 \u2013 Anna Maria Bennett, English novelist (born c. 1760)"]}, {"page": "1785 in literature", "response": ["*Anna Maria Bennett \u2013 Anna"]}, {"page": "Agnes Maria Bennett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Maria Bennett"]}, {"page": "Thomas Pye", "response": ["Pye did not receive active postings until the end of the Seven Years' War, when he commanded several of the navy's dockyards, and even returned to the Leeward Islands to take up his old post. A brief foray into politics proved lacklustre, he made no impact in parliament, and alienated his constituents. His position as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth during the American War of Independence brought the opportunity for rewards. The fleet was reviewed by the King, and Pye received promotion and a knighthood. He retired after the end of the war and died two years later. He had conducted a long-running affair with the novelist Anna Maria Bennett, and left two children by her, including a daughter who became the famous actress Harriet Pye Bennett.", "Pye was made lieutenant-general of marines on 26 September 1780. He stepped down after the end of the American War of Independence, leaving his post as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth on 31 March 1783, and going into retirement. He died two years later, at his home on Suffolk Street, London, on 26 December 1785. He was survived by his daughter Mary. His wife had died in 1762, and for seventeen years he had carried out an affair with the novelist Anna Maria Bennett, the wife of Thomas Bennett, a customs officer.  Thomas Bennett appears to have owed Pye a sizeable sum of money, which Pye forgave in his will, bequeathing his London residence to Anna Maria. Pye and Bennett appear to have at least two children together, Thomas Pye Bennet, and Harriet Pye Bennett, who went on to become a famous actress."]}, {"page": "Anna Bennett", "response": ["*Anna Maria Bennett (c. 1750\u20131808), English novelist"]}, {"page": "Agnes Mary Bennett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Maria Bennett"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women writers", "response": ["*Anna Maria Bennett (c. 1750\u20131808), novelist"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Anna Maria Bennett (c.1750\u20131808), novelist"]}, {"page": "Harriet Pye Esten", "response": ["Esten was born in Tooting in or around the 1760s.
