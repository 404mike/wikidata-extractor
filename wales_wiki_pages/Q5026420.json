Most of the more dangerous experiments he performed on himself. He once spent weeks in hospital after being blown out of the water by a massive self-inflicted explosion, and surfaced from an artificial depth of 90 metres on a single breath of air. All of his research reports remain classified, however.", "link_mentions": {}}}
