However, some of its earliest members were not Herioters, including its first Scottish cap, batsman John Mushet (who played once, against Australia in 1912).  Other members were teachers at the School.  Mushet aside, probably the club's finest early player was John Waddell, who inaugurated a tradition of spin bowling (left-arm, in Waddell's case) and took nearly 300 wickets in six seasons before his early death in 1899.  The Club groundsman was also usually a competent player, who would play for the team as the \"professional\".  This tradition continued until the 1970s, with names including David \"Pa\" Nicoll, Arthur Creber and George Waites.  By 1914, when play was stopped by the outbreak of war across Europe, the fixture list included most of Scotland's leading clubs outside the already existent Western Union.", "After the First World War, Heriot's FP emerged as one of the leading Clubs in the east of Scotland. The playing facilities at Goldenacre expanded to their present dimensions with two, sometimes three, squares.  Several talented players appeared, such as batsman Alec Bateman, off-spinner Alex Gordon, opening bowler Jack Nicoll, and aggressive all-rounder Sid Plowright.  But only two were capped, all-rounder Charles Groves and Club professional Arthur Creber, a quick bowler who has the only \"all-10\" in the First XI's history.  Wicketkeeper Lindsay Mitchell would later become an influential figure as master in charge of cricket at the School, especially in the period after 1950 when a flood of playing talent emerged to inaugurate the club's most successful period on the field, between 1966 and 1985."]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Arthur Creber (1929) : A.
