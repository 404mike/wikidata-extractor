He was a regular in the Wales 22 but only gained one Wales cap as he was being overlooked for Robert Howley and Rupert Moon. He is well known for using the box kick to relieve the pressure posed by the opposition and to also gain territory.  He was a very skilful, technical and intelligent rugby player with excellent game management.\nWhen he joined Cardiff RFC former coach Dai Young said\n\nRichard is a man for all seasons and all conditions, equally good whatever type of game we try to play - I am absolutely delighted that he is joining us.", "link_mentions": {}}}
