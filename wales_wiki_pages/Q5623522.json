She is commemorated in the dedication of two churches near Dulas, Anglesey, in Wales: St Gwenllwyfo's Church, Llanwenllwyfo (built 1856) and its medieval predecessor, the Old Church of St Gwenllwyfo, Llanwenllwyfo, which is now in ruins.Few details about her are known.  She is said to have lived in the seventh century. She is recorded in the Myvyrian Archaiology (a collection of medieval Welsh literature published in the early 19th century) as being the patroness of the church at Llanwenllwyfo without any further details of her life or family being given. Her feast day was recorded as being celebrated on 30 November.  Gwenllwyfo is venerated as a saint, although she was never canonized by a pope: as the historian Jane Cartwright notes, \"In Wales sanctity was locally conferred and none of the medieval Welsh saints appears to have been canonized by the Roman Catholic Church\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Gwenllwyfo's Church", "response": ["St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church near the village of Dulas, in Anglesey, Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also dedicated to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed \u00a3936 towards the total cost of \u00a31,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.", "St Gwenllwyfo's Church stands in a churchyard on a sloping site on the west side of a rural road, about  from the beach at Dulas, in the north-east of Anglesey, Wales.  It was built in the mid-19th century at a cost of \u00a31,417 to replace its medieval predecessor, which was then abandoned. The old church, also dedicated to St Gwenllwyfo (a 7th-century woman about whom nothing else is known) was in need of repair and its congregation was too large for the building.  Although many in the congregation lived in Nebo (in the north of the parish), it was decided to build the new church about two-thirds of a mile from its predecessor (about 1.1\u00a0km) to the south-west in the vicinity of the Llys Dulas estate, whose owners had long been connected with the church.", "St Gwenllwyfo's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales.  It is one of four churches in the parish of Amlwch, along with St Eleth's, Amlwch, St Eilian's, Llaneilian, and St Tyfrodog, Llandyfrydog.  The parish is within the deanery of Twrcelyn, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor.  As of 2012, the priest in charge is H.\u00a0V.\u00a0Jones.", "St Gwenllwyfo's is entered through a porch on the south side near the west end; an internal doorway at the west end of the nave leads into the vestry in the tower. The nave has four bays (internal sections) and the chancel, to the east of the nave, has two. The chancel is separated from the nave by a decorated arch and a step, which raises it above the level of the nave.  Within the chancel, the sanctuary is raised by a further three steps and marked by a rail.", "St Gwenllwyfo's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building\u00a0\u2013 the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed as \"a mid 19th-century Gothic revival church closely associated with the Llys Dulas estate\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes the church's \"fine collection of 15th- and 16th-century Flemish stained glass panels\", which it says is the \"second largest such collection in the world\", and the 17th-century brass plaque.", "Gwenllwyfo"]}, {"page": "Old Church of St Gwenllwyfo, Llanwenllwyfo", "response": ["The Old Church of St Gwenllwyfo, Llanwenllwyfo is a medieval ruined church near Dulas, in Anglesey, Wales, perhaps built in the 15th century to replace another church from which only the 12th-century font survived.

The date of construction of the first church on the site is unknown. There was a church here in medieval times: one 19th-century writer suggested that the present building dates from the 15th century and that the font, probably 12th century in date, was the only surviving part of an earlier church on the site.
