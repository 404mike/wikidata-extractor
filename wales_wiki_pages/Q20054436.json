In the early 1980s the couple began travelling through Europe, living for periods on Skiathos in Greece and, for fifteen years, near Rochefort-en-Terre in Brittany, before returning to Wales in 1999. Williams participated in several group shows in Europe, winning first prize at the Salon de Vannes in 1989, exhibiting at the Salon des Beaux Arts in Paris in 1993 and at the Salon de Nantes Biennale in both 1987 and 1989. Solo shows of her paintings were held at the Galerie Romanet in Paris in 1989 and at the Philip Mouwes Gallery in Amsterdam in 1994."]}]}}
