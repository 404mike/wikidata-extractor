Davies proposed a commercial national network in the United Kingdom and designed and built the local-area NPL network to demonstrate the technology. Many of the wide-area packet-switched networks built in the 1970s were similar \"in nearly all respects\" to his original 1965 design. The ARPANET project credited Davies for his influence, which was key to the development of the Internet.Davies' work was independent of the work of Paul Baran in the United States who had a similar idea in the early 1960s, and who also worked on ARPANET.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Data Encryption Standard", "response": ["* Improved Davies' attack: while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialized technique for DES, first suggested by Donald Davies in the eighties, and improved by Biham and Biryukov (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 250 known plaintexts, has a computational complexity of 250, and has a 51% success rate."]}]}}
