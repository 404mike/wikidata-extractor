He was educated at Llangefni national school. When his father set up subsidiary businesses under the management of his three sons, Richard Davies  was assigned to the old ferry-terminal of Porthaethwy, which was reconstituted as Menai Bridge. This timber importing business  developed so successfully that all the family became involved and the business developed into large-scale ship-owning which generated considerable wealth, based to a large extent on guano. His brother, Robert, was renowned as a philanthropist.\nDavies became a notable figure in politics as a  Welsh radical nonconformist. He stood as Liberal candidate for Caernarvon at the 1852 general election but lost by 93 votes. Davies was Anglesey's first Nonconformist J.P. and was High Sheriff of Anglesey in 1858. He was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anglesey in the election of 1868. He retained the seat till the  1886 general election, when he retired, being opposed to the proposal for Irish Home Rule.At one time Davies lived at Bwlch-y-fen, but afterwards at Treborth, opposite Menai Bridge and was a benefactor to Bangor Normal College and to the \u2018British\u2019 schools.  He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey in 1884.Davies died  at Treborth at the age of 77 and was buried in Llandysilio churchyard. Famously his final words are reputed to be \"cannot be fathomed\". A memorial to him  is in the Menai Bridge English Presbyterian Church alongside memorials to other members of the family. ..(The Davies' family was closely associated with this church, it having been built at Robert's expense.)\nDavies married Anne Rees, daughter of Rev. Henry Rees of Liverpool and niece of William Rees in 1855 and had several children, among whom were\n\nHenry Rees Davies.\nBeatrice Conway Davies, who married in 1902 Richard Hughes.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Richard Davies"]}, {"page": "Ynys M\u00f4n (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Richard Davies"]}, {"page": "List of Lord Lieutenants of Anglesey", "response": ["*Richard Davies 1 April 1884 \u2013 27 October 1896"]}, {"page": "Church Island (Anglesey)", "response": ["The present-day church of Saint Tysilio was founded in the fifteenth century.
