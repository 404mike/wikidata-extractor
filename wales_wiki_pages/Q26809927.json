Several notable events took place at the building during this time. In 1911, American Civil War spy Pryce Lewis killed himself by jumping off the building's dome, having been denied a government pension. After the World expos\u00e9 of the Ku Klux Klan was published in September 1921, the Ku Klux Klan threatened to destroy the building with a bomb, prompting an armed guard of police and Department of Justice employees to be stationed outside of the building. The next year, the facade of the World Building was used to display scores from the 1922 World Series. There were also some minor fires, including one in 1919, and another in 1924 that slightly damaged the World presses. Overall, the World was not prospering financially, and it shuttered in 1931."]}, {"page": "1911 in Wales", "response": ["*6 December - Pryce Lewis, detective and spy, 80 (suicide)Mortimer, Gavin (2010).
