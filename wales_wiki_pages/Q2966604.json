In February 2011, Genndy Tartakovsky, creator of Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and Star Wars: Clone Wars, took over as the sixth scheduled director, and made his feature directorial debut with the film.  He reimagined the film to follow the energy, organic nature, and exaggeration of 2D animation, particularly as seen in the work of director Tex Avery.  \"I took all the aesthetics I like from 2-D and applied them here,\" Tartakovsky said. \"I don't want to do animation to mimic reality. I want to push reality.\" \"I wanted to have an imprint so you'd go, 'Well, only Genndy can make this.'
