It appears that he was the first professional artist to live in Aberystwyth.\nThe earliest instance of his work that is  available is his outline drawing of John Williams (Shon Sgubor) that he drew in  1839, and was published in Wales, volume 15 (1898), p. 113.  Another portrait of the Rev. John Hughes is held at the National Library of Wales.\nJohn Cambrian Rowland is mainly remembered for his collection of Welsh costume prints - many of these were published in  1848. These have become standard images of 19th century Welsh life. The contents of his paintings  suggest that he settled in north Wales, and one biography suggests that he was appointed  as an art instructor at the Caernarvon Church Training College.", "link_mentions": {}}}
