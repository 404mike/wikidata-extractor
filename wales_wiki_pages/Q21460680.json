It appears that he was the first professional artist to live in Aberystwyth.\nThe earliest instance of his work that is  available is his outline drawing of John Williams (Shon Sgubor) that he drew in  1839, and was published in Wales, volume 15 (1898), p. 113.  Another portrait of the Rev. John Hughes is held at the National Library of Wales.\nJohn Cambrian Rowland is mainly remembered for his collection of Welsh costume prints - many of these were published in  1848. These have become standard images of 19th century Welsh life. The contents of his paintings  suggest that he settled in north Wales, and one biography suggests that he was appointed  as an art instructor at the Caernarvon Church Training College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rowland", "response": ["* John Cambrian Rowland (1819\u20131890), Welsh painter"]}, {"page": "1890 in Wales", "response": ["*unknown date - John Cambrian Rowland, painter, 70"]}, {"page": "1819 in Wales", "response": ["* 7 December - John Cambrian Rowland, painter (died 1890)"]}, {"page": "Owen Morris Roberts", "response": ["Roberts had originally been a ship's carpenter, but subsequently took over his father's joinery business, studied art and geometry with John Cambrian Rowland, and trained himself to become an architect.Jones, Anthony (1996) Welsh Chapels, NMW, p.87 He went on to design a large number of chapels, particularly in North Wales, and other public buildings."]}, {"page": "Samuel Maurice Jones", "response": ["Samuel Maurice Jones was born in Mochdre, a coastal village in north-east Wales near Colwyn Bay. His father, Rev. John Jones, was a Calvinistic Methodist minister. Jones was trained first at the Caernarfon School of Art under the tutelage of John Cambrian Rowland and later, in London where he studied under William Collingwood between 1870-73. Collingwood was an Associate of the Society of Painters in Watercolours and offered Jones a thorough and traditional training in the fundamentals of arts education; schooling him in the importance of line and composition, shading, drawing carefully from nature and drawing from memory.See Jones notebook and study journal completed while under the tuition of Colinwood, 1870-3, part of the bequest at the National Library of Wales. The first entry in the study book detailing his lesson with Collingwood on Monday 11 April 1870, recalls his teachers' words: 'You must regard your hand as an instrument requiring to be taught how to execute with certainty and freedom, every mental command.'See Jones' study book of this period, 1870-3 in the Samuel Maurice Jones Papers, 1866-39, 'Artist Notebook', [p.1].
