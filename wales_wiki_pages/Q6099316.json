He is best known for editing Allegri's Miserere with the famous top-C part for the treble. He is also well known for \"The Three Kings\", an arrangement of a song by Peter Cornelius as a choral work for Epiphany.Born into a Welsh musical family at Llandaff, Atkins graduated with a bachelor of music degree from The Queen's College, Oxford in 1892, and subsequently obtained a Doctorate in Music (Oxford). He was assistant organist of Hereford Cathedral (1890-1893) and organist of St Laurence Church, Ludlow from 1893 to 1897. He directed the triennial Three Choirs Festival from his appointment at Worcester in 1897 through until 1948 (acting as conductor for 12 of them), and he succeeded in the difficult task of reviving the Festival in 1920 after a suspension of six years.With his friend Edward Elgar he prepared what quickly became the standard edition of Bach's St. Matthew Passion. In 1904 Elgar dedicated the third of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches to him. Atkins also collaborated with Elgar on the cantata Hymn of Faith, which Atkins composed for the 1905 Three Choirs Festival in Worcester. Elgar prepared the text for him from the scriptures and took a great interest in its composition. It was revived in October 1995 at Worcester Cathedral and played by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and the Worcester Festival Choral Society, conducted by Donald Hunt. A BBC recording exists. And it was Atkins who later suggested that Elgar's Severn Suite\u2014produced in 1930 as a brass band competition piece, and arranged for orchestra in 1932\u2014should be transcribed for organ; Elgar suggested that Atkins do the arrangement himself. The resulting work\u2014on which Elgar and Atkins worked together\u2014was completed in 1932 and published as Elgar's 'Second Organ Sonata'.Other compositions included a Magnificat and Nunc dimittis in G (which has been recorded by the Choir of Worcester Cathedral), the anthem If Ye then be Risen with Christ (published Novello, 1904), the Chorale Prelude on the tune 'Worcester' (published 1924) and songs such as The Shepherdess, The Years at the Spring, and Elleen, in Victorian ballad style. He was knighted in 1921 for services to music and was President of the Royal College of Organists from 1935 to 1936.Atkins married Katherine Butler in 1899. Katherine became Mayor of Worcester in 1937. She died in 1954. Their ashes were interred in Worcester Cathedral. Their son, Edward Wulstan Ivor Atkins (1904-2003) was an engineer and writer. He was Elgar's godson and wrote The Elgar/Atkins Friendship in 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Ivor Atkins (1869\u20131953), organist"]}, {"page": "Llandaff", "response": ["*Sir Ivor Atkins (1869\u20131953); choirmaster and organist, was born in Llandaff."]}, {"page": "Pomp and Circumstance Marches", "response": ["March No. 3 was completed in November 1904 and published in 1905.

From 1928 until his retirement in 1967, Sumsion was responsible for planning and serving as the principal conductor for eleven festivals held at Gloucester.  Although Sumsion personally acknowledged the challenge that cathedral organists\u2014who were primarily choral conductors\u2014faced in conducting major orchestral works, his own conducting was greatly respected, and his interpretations of Elgar's works were viewed as being representative of the composer's own readings. At the first festival following Elgar's death (1934), Sumsion proposed that the three cathedral organists each conduct one of the Elgar works on the program, a welcome division of labour for the host conductor that would later become standard practice. After the retirement in 1949 of Percy Hull of Hereford and Ivor Atkins of Worcester, Sumsion remained the only direct link with Elgar amongst the musicians of the three cathedrals."]}, {"page": "Peter Cornelius", "response": ["In Britain to this day, Cornelius's best-known work is \"The Three Kings\", a song for voice and piano in which the soloist sings \"Three Kings from Persian lands afar\u00a0...\", while from the piano is heard the chorale tune of Philipp Nicolai, Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern (\"How brightly shines the morning star\") underneath.

In fact, it is an Advent hymn in which the morning star is an allegory for the arrival of Jesus, not the Star of Bethlehem.

In 1859 he composed a completely new version again for soloist and piano, using the 16th-century chorale \"Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern\" (\"How Brightly Shines the Morning Star\") by Philipp Nicolai in the piano accompaniment after a suggestion from Franz Liszt.
