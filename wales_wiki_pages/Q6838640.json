In 1967, the band recorded a cover of \"Morning Dew\" on the British Columbia label, that failed to have any chart impact. After just eighteen months, the core of 'Human Beans' formed a new band called Love Sculpture that again reinstated Edmunds, Jones and Williams as a trio. Love Sculpture released their debut single \"River to Another Day\" in 1968. Their second single was a quasi-novelty Top 5, a reworking Khachaturian's classical piece \"Sabre Dance\" as a speed-crazed rock number, inspired by Keith Emerson's classical rearrangements.Rick Clark, liner notes from The Dave Edmunds Anthology (1968\u201390), Rhino Records R2 71191 (1993) \"Sabre Dance\" became a hit after garnering the enthusiastic attention of British DJ John Peel, who was so impressed he played it twice in one programme on \"Top Gear\".

Marchand promised the Sunsets that, with his connections in the music business, he could get them a contract with CBS Records.  True to his word, CBS did indeed offer the band a deal and Marchand took the Sunsets into Morgan Studios in Willesden to record their second album, I'm No J.D., which was issued in the autumn of 1971.  Halfway through the sessions, Carl Petersen left and the album was completed with the ace Welsh rock and roll guitarist Mickey Gee.  Although he remained with the Sunsets to play a few gigs after the sessions had finished, his stay with the band was short lived.  However, Mickey Gee was to perform a major role in Shakin' Stevens' success of the early 80s, adding his distinctive lead guitar to many of Shaky's biggest hit records.  With CBS reportedly ignoring Donny Marchand's advice to release the album as a budget price record, I'm No J.D. sold, in Marchand's own words, \"1,000 copies\".
