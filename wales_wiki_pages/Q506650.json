Hamilton said afterwards, \"It was rubbish - seriously. I can't play any worse. It was a good attitude but rubbish snooker. I am rubbish now a lot of the time. I am getting old basically. It's no fun but it's better than working\". He reiterated these sentiments after he lost 6\u20134 to Graeme Dott in the second round stating, \"I don't practice much anymore. I only play because it is better than working. I will have to work for a long time so I just want to swerve it for as long as possible\".
