She persuaded Nocon to include Andrew's work as well.Prince Andrew, Photographs (Hamilton, 1985), p. 8: \"The next step in my development as a photographer, apart from my trial and error experimenting, came when Koo Stark, now Jefferies, came back to the U.K. with some pictures of herself for printing, taken by Norman Parkinson. She went to see photographic printer Gene Nocon. At this time Gene was organising an exhibition planned for October 1983. The theme was photographs taken by people who were the subjects of photographers. He invited her to take part. It was called \"Personal Points of View\". Koo came to see me and suggested that I should take part as well. I replied that I was sure that I wouldn't be allowed to. Koo then went back to see Gene without my knowledge and asked him if a friend of hers could also take part. Although Koo was reluctant to name names and Gene was equally reluctant to agree to an unknown person taking part, it seems they came to an understanding...\" Her early photographs led to a book deal, for which she took lessons from Norman Parkinson. She travelled to Tobago, where he lived, and he became her mentor. Her book Contrasts (1985) included about a hundred of her photographs. She went on to study the work of leading photographers, including Angus McBean, whom she met and photographed.Phil Coomes, In pictures: Koo Stark on both sides of the lens  dated 8 May 2017 at BBC.co.uk developing her interests in photography to include reportage, portraits, landscapes, still life, and other work."]}, {"page": "1904", "response": ["* June 8 \u2013 Angus McBean, Welsh photographer (died 1990)"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Angus McBean (1904\u20131990), photographer"]}, {"page": "Please Please Me", "response": ["George Martin was an honorary fellow of the Zoological Society of London, which owns London Zoo and he thought that it might be good publicity for the zoo to have the Beatles pose outside the insect house for the cover photography of the album.
