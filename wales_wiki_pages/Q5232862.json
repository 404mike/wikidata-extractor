In the autumn of 1784 he entered with an exhibition the Presbyterian academy, then at Swansea, under Solomon Harries (1726\u20131785), who was succeeded in 1785 by Josiah Rees and Thomas Lloyd, a first cousin.

Agriculture exhausted his savings. The chance to act as colleague in the congregation that had been his father's was closed to him, as David Davis, opposed the election of a Socinian and Baptist; by this time, however, Lloyd had rejected the rite of baptism in any form, as an institution confined to the apostolic age. A secession from Llwyn-rhyd-owen chose him as their pastor, and built two small chapels at Capel-y-groes (with a membership of 80) and Pant-y-defaid (with a membership of 60). His stay in Cardiganshire did not last long. Leaving his congregations to the care of John James, he moved in 1803 to Palgrave in Suffolk, running a school and taking charge of a Presbyterian congregation (5 April 1803 to 4 October 1811).

He later attended a local grammar school, and Carmarthen Academy (1815\u201319), where his father had taught. Having become a member of the Unitarian Church whilst at college, he began preaching at the local chapel. Later, following the retirement of David Davis of Castell Hywel in 1820, he took charge of the churches of Alltyblaca, Bwlchyfadfa, Llwyn-rhyd-Owen, and Pen-rhiw. He also worked as an assistant at the grammar school run by Davis, before starting schools of his own at Gelli-gron, Blaenbydernyn (Pencarreg, Carmarthenshire), Tyssul Castle, and Tre-fach, and, in 1830, an academy at Adpar, Newcastle Emlyn. His pupils included the antiquary Thomas Stephens."]}]}}
