The government agreed that workers employed on public works should enjoy an eight-hour day with no loss of pay and stonemasons celebrated with a holiday and procession on Monday 12 May 1856, when about 700 people marched with 19 trades involved. By 1858, the eight-hour day was firmly established in the building industry and by 1860, the eight-hour day was fairly widely worked in Victoria. From 1879, the eight-hour day was a public holiday in Victoria. The initial success in Melbourne led to the decision to organise a movement, to actively spread the eight-hour idea, and secure the condition generally."]}, {"page": "James Stephens", "response": ["James Stephens may refer to:", "* James Stephens (MP) (died 1683), MP for Gloucester", "* James Stephens (trade unionist) (1821\u20131889), Welsh-born Australian stonemason and trade unionist", "* James Stephens (Fenian) (1825\u20131901), Irish revolutionary", "* James Stephens (Australian politician) (1881\u20131962), South Australian politician", "* James Stephens (author) (1882\u20131950), Irish novelist and poet", "* James Stephens (actor) (born 1951), American actor", "* James Stephens GAA, a Kilkenny-based Gaelic Athletic Association club"]}, {"page": "1889 in Wales", "response": ["*14 November \u2013 James Stephens, stonemason, Chartist, and later Australian trade unionist, 68"]}, {"page": "List of burials at Melbourne General Cemetery", "response": ["* James Stephens (1821\u20131889), stonemason, Chartist and Eight Hours' campaigner"]}, {"page": "James Gilvray Galloway", "response": ["He was born in Springfield, Fife, Scotland.
