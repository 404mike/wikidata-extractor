Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787-1810).Hodder (1982), p. 59 From his initial capital Ambohimanga, and later from the Rova of Antananarivo, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King Radama I (1810\u201328), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron, David Jones and David Griffiths, who established schools, transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.Ade Ajayi (1998), pp.\u00a0413\u2013422"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*David Griffiths (1792\u20131863), missionary to Madagascar, translator of the first Bible written in an African language"]}, {"page": "Radama I", "response": ["Radama's military campaign to Toamasina in 1820 brought him into contact with Welshmen David Jones and David Griffiths of the Protestant London Missionary Society (LMS), who had established a school there enrolling three students. Radama was inspired to introduce similar schools throughout Imerina and within a year had established 23 schools enrolling 2300 students, of whom a third were girls. He tasked the LMS missionaries to transcribe and teach the Malagasy language using the Latin alphabet. It was under Radama's rule that LMS missionaries (with notable contributions from Scottsman James Cameron) set up craft industries in carpentry, leather, tin plating and cotton, introduced the first printing press, translated and printed Bibles in the Malagasy language and oversaw Radama's plan to establish dozens of schools offering compulsory literacy courses and basic education for the nobles of Imerina."]}, {"page": "Ranavalona I", "response": ["Despite her elevated rank among the royal wives, Ramavo was not the preferred wife of Radama and did not bear him any children. Upon Andrianampoinimerina's death in 1810, Radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among Ramavo's relatives, an act that may have strained their relationship. Unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage, the neglected Ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with David Griffiths and his fellow missionaries in Griffiths' home. These visits established a deep friendship between Ramavo and Griffiths that  endured for three decades.Campbell (2012), p. 51"]}, {"page": "Machynlleth", "response": ["*David Griffiths, (20 December 1792 \u2013 21 March 1863), Welsh missionary and Bible translator to Madagascar, lived in Machynlleth from 1858 until his death "]}, {"page": "David Griffiths", "response": ["*David Griffiths (sport shooter) (1874\u20131931), British Olympic sports shooter", "*David Griffiths (rugby league) (active since 1998), English rugby coach", "*David Griffiths (golfer) (born 1980), English professional golfer", "*David Griffiths (cricketer) (born 1985), English cricketer", "*David Griffiths (archdeacon of Berkshire) (1927\u20132012), Anglican priest", "*David Griffiths (botanist) (1867\u20131935), American botanist", "*David Griffiths (composer) (born 1950), New Zealand composer, baritone and convener", "*David Griffiths (missionary) (1792\u20131863), British Christian missionary and translator in Madagascar", "*David Griffiths (politician) (1896\u20131977), British politician, member of Parliament for Rother Valley", "*David Griffiths (co-operative economist), Australian economist ", "*David Griffiths (portrait painter) (born 1939), Welsh artist"]}, {"page": "Griffith John", "response": ["In 1853 he offered his services to the London Missionary Society and after two years' training was ordained in 1855 at Ebenezer, Swansea.
