The house was originally built of stone and had sufficient status to host Charles I. Between 1664 and 1672, however, William Morgan decided to rebuild the house on a larger scale from red brick, at that time a rare building material in Wales. The architect of the enlarged house is not known for certain, but Newman follows Howard Colvin's suggestion that the design was by Roger and William Hurlbutt, who had worked in a similar style at Ragley Hall and Warwick Castle. The architectural historian Peter Smith, writing in his work Houses of the Welsh Countryside, called Tredegar, \"the most splendid brick house of the seventeenth century in Wales\". In his 1882 publication, local historian Octavius Morgan provides a plan of an intricate garden maze which was in place prior to the 1660s improvements and which probably dated from the time of Queen Elizabeth I.Morgan, Octavius (1882), \"Goldcliff and the Ancient Roman Inscribed Stone Found There 1878\", Monmouthshire & Caerleon Antiquarian Association"]}, {"page": "Augustus Wollaston Franks", "response": ["Franks used personal influence on behalf of the Museum to help in the acquisition of collections.

There is a tale, often repeated in 19th century and later guidebooks, that during the English Civil War King Charles was chased across the river from Portskewett: the pursuing Roundheads were drowned after being landed at low tide on the English Stones by the boatmen, after which Cromwell ordered the ferries to cease operation. This story originated in a deposition given by Giles Gilbert of Shirenewton during the course of a 1720s legal case regarding rights to operate the ferry, and which was later printed by William Coxe in his 1801 Historical Tour of Monmouthshire.Morgan, Octavius (1860) Notes on the ancient domestic residences of Pentre-Bach, Crick, Ty-Mawr, the Garn, Crindau, and St. Julian's, v4, p.12 While Gilbert claimed to be \"credibly informed\" that a group of Parliamentarian soldiers had perished while pursuing the King, another witness in the same legal case gave evidence that the incident had in fact involved a group of twelve Royalists who \"in haste to pass\" in November 1644 had forced the boatmen to take them across at low tide.Morgan (1860) p.13 The antiquary Octavius Morgan, on investigating these stories, found that the Iter Carolinum and the diary of Richard Symonds proved that Charles had intended to use the Black Rock crossing to reach Bristol on 24 July 1645, but had been dissuaded. Morgan however noted a contemporary report that Charles had a \"narrow escape of being taken near the Black Rock\" in July 1645 and suggested that some of Charles's party had crossed the Passage on the evening of 24 July \"probably sent purposely to mislead the enemy [...] and the result was death by drowning of the pursuers\".Morgan (1860) p.13"]}, {"page": "Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"9\" |Octavius Morgan || rowspan=\"9\" | Conservative "]}, {"page": "Cambrian Archaeological Association", "response": ["In the early days of the Cambrian Archaeological Association the position of the president of the society went to a member of the landed gentry or aristocracy in Wales or the Welsh Marches, as well as to Welsh bishops and senior figures in the Anglican Church. The first president was Sir Stephen Glynne, the brother-in-law of William Gladstone, a passionate ecclesiologist, who was a guiding figure of the association for many years. The main intention of the presidency was, and still to some extent is, to provide an entree for visits and the organisation of the summer general meeting. It is normal for the presidency to be held for one year, but on some occasions it has been held for longer. Nearly all the early presidents were either clerics in the Anglican Church or had at some time been Members of Parliament. It is very clear that the summer meetings were used as a forum (outside the formal events), for the discussion of matters not directly associated with archaeology or Welsh history. Most notably a number of the presidents were members of the Canterbury Society, an association for the colonisation of the South Island of New Zealand. Also many were directly involved in the railway companies which were opening up Wales at the time, most notably Earl Vane Tempest, later Lord Londonderry of Machynlleth, president in 1866, who was the chairman of the Cambrian Railways. This does not imply that the majority of the presidents were uninterested in archaeology. The Earl of Dunraven of Dunraven Castle in Glamorgan, president in 1849 and 1869, while not involved in Welsh archaeology, was a leading Irish intellectual and Celtic scholar, as well as a supporter of Catholic Emancipation. Many of the other presidents who were MPs were leading Antiquaries, particularly Octavius Morgan and Stanley Leighton \u2013 the latter was the founding figure of SPAB. Equally most of the bishops and churchmen, who were presidents, were leading academics. The scholarly Rev Basil Jones, the second secretary of the association, later became the president in 1878, after his elevation to the Bishopric of St David's.", "* 1857 Monmouth: Octavius Morgan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Octavius Morgan"]}, {"page": "Shire Hall, Monmouth", "response": ["The County Gaol was located a short distance from the court rooms.

John Frost was arrested in Newport shortly after the riot, followed by other leaders of the group.  A Special Commission opened at Shire Hall on 10 December 1839, and an appointed Grand Jury considered what charges to bring against them.

Frost, William Jones, Zephaniah Williams and five others were duly charged with high treason, and their trial began on 31 December.
