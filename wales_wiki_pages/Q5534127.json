While the band had been widely advertised as a Main Stage act, management for the girls' claimed that they were never booked for the festival. Geoff Ellis, organiser of T, refuted these claims. Just a few days after they pulled out, the band announced a concert with fellow popstars McFly in London on the day they were due to be at T. It was later revealed, by the Daily Record, that the real reason the girls pulled out was fear by tour management that they would not be well received by fans of festival headliners Rage Against the Machine waiting at the Main Stage to see the aforementioned act."]}, {"page": "UK Festival Awards", "response": ["* Lifetime Achievement in association with Music Week \u2013 Geoff Ellis, DF Concerts", "Hosted by: Craig Charles.

The festival's opening year was in 1994 and it has been held annually since. The festival's main sponsor is Tennents Brewery, the reason for the 'T' in the title, and is sponsored by DF Concerts. The festival was originally held in Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire for the first four years and ran for two days but since then has changed to a three-day weekend with the option of an extra Thursday night camping. The festival has been the host to many famous bands over the years with acts including Foo Fighters, Eminem, Green Day and The Killers. The festival director Geoff Ellis says \"The film really captures the spirit of what T in the Park is about!\"  It allows the viewers of the film to experience the festival through the eyes of bands that travel to T in the Park instead of just attending as a regular guest, thus really allowing the full T in the park experience."]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Geoff Ellis (1970\u20131976) : G.
