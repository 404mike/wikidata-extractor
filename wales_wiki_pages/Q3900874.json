He played the lead role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical The Phantom of the Opera in London (1991, 1992), Toronto (1992, 1994\u20131995, 1998), The Canadian \"Far East\" Tour \u2013 Vancouver, Singapore, and Hong Kong (1995,1997), and in the UK Tour in Bradford, and Manchester (2000). In 1994 and 1995 members of the Phantom of the Opera Appreciation Society voted him their favourite Phantom.\nKarrie was brought up in Wales, where he had radio and television shows on BBC Wales. He began his career as the lead singer of pop group Peter and the Wolves, and went on to star in several West End musical productions, including Les Mis\u00e9rables and Chess. He also played Daddy Warbucks in Annie, Fagin in Oliver! and Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof for Aberystwyth Arts Centre. In 2005 he starred with Shan C\u00f4thi in the Mal Pope musical Amazing Grace at the Wales Millennium Centre for the Wales Theatre Company. He performed alongside John Owen Jones and Nic Greenshields in the one-off Three Phantoms concert in aid of George Thomas Hospice Care. He also created roles in three Bernard J.

Compressing his mammoth work, which had required twelve hours to tell fully on screen, into a reasonable length for the theatre proved to be a daunting task. When the production opened at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., it closely resembled Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Phantom of the Opera in size and scope, with a cast of thirty-eight characters, more than three hundred costumes, a libretto nearly entirely sung, and a running time of 3\u00bd hours. Critics and audiences alike had difficulty following the convoluted plot, and it was decided to cut much of the music and replace it with dialogue. Composer Chihara objected and was dismissed. The leading man Peter Karrie was also let go and was replaced by Philip Casnoff, who had auditioned for the role but was rejected by producers who deemed him too young and too American."]}, {"page": "Bernard J.

Stand-out tracks, according to the Virgin Encyclopedia of Film and Stage Music (VEFSM),  were considered to be \"Through The Eyes Of A Child\" \"Good Breeding\" and \"Thank God They're Married\". Pride And Prejudice was introduced to US audiences, complete with five new songs, by the Public Theatre Company of Peoria, Illinois, in January 1995. Taylor's musical interpretation of the Austen novel was considered to be closer to its source than the 1959 Broadway version (see VEFSM),  First Impressions (Austen's original title for the book), which starred Hermione Gingold. By 2012 there had been more than 30 productions of the show worldwide in the US,  UK, Germany, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Brazil and the USA.", "This production, (with additional lyrics by Eric Vickers), included numbers such as \"Wild Talk Of Vampires\", \"And Sheep Shall Not Safely Graze\", \"Worms Feed On My Brains\" \"Ship Of The Dead\" \"Blasphemy\" and \"Somewhere At The Edges Of Creation\".

The world premiere was staged at the Madison Theatre, Peoria, Illinois, in September 1995, and the show had its first European performances a month later in Eastbourne.
