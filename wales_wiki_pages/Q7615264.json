He grew up in Llanelli and attended the local Coedcae School with Scarlets team-mate Samson Lee, and began his rugby career with New Dock Stars RFC, a former club of veteran Scarlets prop Phil John. Williams joined the Scarlets academy at the age of 15 and made his first appearance for Llanelli RFC as a replacement in a 32\u201316 win over Cardiff RFC on 4 December 2010. At the end of January 2011, he made his first appearance for the Scarlets, coming on as a replacement for Steven Shingler for the final seven minutes of a 34\u20137 Anglo-Welsh Cup defeat to Saracens. He started his first game two weeks later, playing at fly-half for Llanelli and scoring five points (one conversion and one penalty) in a 59\u201315 defeat to Aberavon.", "Despite being picked by the BBC's Sean Holley and Jonathan Davies as a player to watch in 2014\u201315, Williams began the season down the pecking order among the Scarlets' back three options, starting just one of the team's opening nine matches of the season, albeit being named on the bench for their first two Champions Cup games. He suffered a concussion that kept him out of the game against Zebre on 1 November, but returned to the starting line-up for the Scarlets' two Anglo-Welsh Cup matches that month, before dropping to the bench for the Pro12 game against Glasgow on 21 November, and only after Regan King had been injured in the pre-match warm-up. He was on the bench again for the first two games of 2015, and was forced into an extended cameo in the second match against Glasgow after Liam Williams suffered a shoulder injury early in the second half, and started in place of Williams in the next match away to Leicester Tigers in the Champions Cup the following week. Full-back duties were assigned to Steven Shingler, Josh Lewis and Kristian Phillips for the next three games, but Williams started the next five during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the first of those in a 32\u201314 home win over Connacht on 15 February after making an interception on his own goal line, and another in a 23\u201313 win at home to Leinster on 7 March. A shoulder injury that required surgery brought an early end to Williams' season. During the season, Williams also played three times for Carmarthen Quins in the British and Irish Cup, scoring one try against Jersey Reds."]}, {"page": "2012 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["Andy Robinson announced Scotland's 36-man squad for the Six Nations on 5 January.
