Stevens's songs have a mystical, faintly psychedelic flavour, and are mostly sung in his native Welsh language. Still largely unknown outside Wales, he was discovered by DJ Jimmy Savile, who saw him performing in a Manchester folk club in 1965. This led to Stevens recording his first single \u2013 with arranger John Paul Jones (later of Led Zeppelin) \u2013 for Decca Records that same year, though it sold badly.", "link_mentions": {}}}
