His first novel, published in 1935, was the autobiographical Call Back Yesterday. Goodwin's most acclaimed work, The Heyday in the Blood, appeared in 1936, and his last novel, Come Michaelmas, appeared in 1939.

Noted for his eye for and sympathy with nature, critics of the time described this as one of the most striking features of his writings.

In his discussion of the history of the association of particular novelists with place in British literature, critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century. Often such British regional literature captures the social and local  character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called local colour): \"Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial.\"J.A Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984, p.560. Thomas Hardy's (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names Wessex. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the Bront\u00eb sisters, and writers like Mary Webb (1881-1927), Margiad Evans (1909\u201358) and Geraint Goodwin (1903\u201342), who are associate with the Welsh border region.

Similarly, novelist and poet Walter Scott's (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for Scotland and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century. Scott's novels were influential in recreating a Scottish identity that the upper-class British society could embrace."]}, {"page": "Ysgol Uwchradd Tywyn", "response": ["* Geraint Goodwin (1903\u201341), author of The Heyday in the Blood (1936)"]}]}}
