One reason for this popularity is the myth's primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife. Another reason is that the characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace. In particular, the myth conveys a \"strong sense of family loyalty and devotion\", as the Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths put it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.", "There are, however, important points of disagreement. The origins of Osiris are much debated, and the basis for the myth of his death is also somewhat uncertain. One influential hypothesis was given by the anthropologist James Frazer, who in 1906 said that Osiris, like other \"dying and rising gods\" across the ancient Near East, began as a personification of vegetation. His death and restoration, therefore, were based on the yearly death and re-growth of plants. Many Egyptologists adopted this explanation. But in the late 20th century, J. Gwyn Griffiths, who extensively studied Osiris and his mythology, argued that Osiris originated as a divine ruler of the dead, and his connection with vegetation was a secondary development. Meanwhile, scholars of comparative religion have criticized the overarching concept of \"dying and rising gods\", or at least Frazer's assumption that all these gods closely fit the same pattern. More recently, the Egyptologist Rosalie David maintains that Osiris originally \"personified the annual rebirth of the trees and plants after the [Nile] inundation.\""]}, {"page": "Porth", "response": ["*J.

Most of those who have studied the Sator Square agree that it is a proper name, either an adaptation of a non-Latin word or most likely a name invented specifically for this sentence. Jerome Carcopino thought that it came from a Celtic, specifically Gaulish, word for 'plough'. David Daube argued that it represented a Hebrew or Aramaic rendition of the Greek , or \"Alpha-Omega\" (cf. Revelation 1:8) by early Christians. J. Gwyn Griffiths contended that it came, via Alexandria, from the attested Egyptian name \u1e24r-\u1e24p, which he took to mean \"the face of Apis\". An origin in Graeco-Roman Egypt was also advocated by Miroslav Marcovich, who maintains that Arepo is a Latinized abbreviation of Harpocrates, god of the rising sun, in some places called , which Marcovich suggests corresponds to Sator Arepo. If one accepts that one or more deity names is encoded into the Sator square, then this word square could be considered an example of a theophoric mandala."]}, {"page": "2004 in Wales", "response": ["**J.

The expulsion of Ateius was not unique; Appius conducted a thorough housecleaning, removing any man who was the son of a freedman and others such as the historian Sallust. In the popular view, the disaster at Carrhae was caused by Crassus's ignoring the omens. Cicero, who was himself an augur and thus trained in assessing divine signs, presents a more complex perspective in his book De divinatione. In Book 1, the interlocutor Quintus Cicero, the author's brother, argues that Appius was wrong. Even if the auspices had been fabricated, since they proved true in the outcome, Ateius had made a meaningful connection with the divine will. If they had been false, the blame would have fallen on the man who spoke falsely, not on the man to whom a false statement was made. But omens predict what can happen unless proper precautions are taken, and blame falls on the man who did not listen.Cicero, De divinatione 1.29\u201330; the case of Ateius discussed at some length in the commentary of David Wardle, Cicero on Divination (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2006), pp. 180\u2013187 online.
