On Wednesday, 12 June 1867, the foundation stone of the new building was laid by Samuel Morley, M.P., in the presence of the Mayor and Corporation of Brecknock, and of a large gathering from England and Wales. In the outset, plans of the proposed college were prepared by the Rev. Thomas Thomas, of Landore, who had taken great interest in the affair; but after tenders had been advertised for and received, it was found that the cost for carrying out the plans in their entirety would be considerably more than the committee felt themselves justified in incurring. The design was then reduced, and eventually it was decided to accept the tender of Messrs. Watkins and Jenkins, of Swansea, at \u00a38,250. Towards this amount there was then in hand a sum of about \u00a32,000, the result of the effort made in connection with the Bicentenary movement, after expenditure for various objects. Another noble sum of \u00a31,000 was contributed by Samuel Morley, and a number of smaller sums were given by others interested in the progress of education, and especially in the proper preparation of young men for the work of the ministry. The college altogether cost, inclusive of  of freehold land, about \u00a311,000, all of which, with the exception of \u00a3900, was raised by the opening days, and the remaining debt was wiped off by the end of the same year.
