His regular position was at fly-half, though he often played at fullback.\nThomas began his rugby career with the Llanelli-based Scarlets, and made his debut for the region in 2003 when he played in a friendly against the Slovenia national team. Llanelli won the game 95\u20130, scoring 14 tries, with Thomas converting eleven of them. He also scored one penalty, bringing his points total for the game to 25. In the 2003\u201304 season, Thomas made five appearances for Llanelli, including three in the 2003-04 Celtic League.\nHowever, Thomas did not play for the regional side again until April 2005, almost 18 months after his last appearance. He made three more appearances in the 2004\u201305 season, before falling out of favour and not making another appearance until April 2006. Again, he only made two more appearances in the 2005\u201306 season, but managed to hold down a place in the side for the 2006\u201307 Magners League, sharing duties at fullback with Barry Davies and Morgan Stoddart. He made 25 appearances that season, and scored 110 points.\nThomas began the 2007\u201308 Magners League as the Scarlets' starting fly-half, while regular number 10 Stephen Jones was on Wales duty at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, but lost the berth to rival fly-half Rhys Priestland before Jones' return. In the 2008\u201309 Magners League, Thomas spent much of his time on the bench, playing second-fiddle to Jones and Priestland at fly-half, and the majority of his playing time was spent in other positions, including two starts on the wing in December 2008. Thomas only made six appearances for the Scarlets in 2009, resulting in a transfer to Leeds Carnegie in June 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Ceiron Thomas (born 1983), Welsh rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "Ysgol y Strade", "response": ["* Ceiron Thomas, Scarlets rugby player.

That summer, former Scarlets fly-half Stephen Jones returned to the region after two seasons in France with Clermont Auvergne, and for the 2006\u201307 season, Priestland served as the Scarlets' third-choice fly-half behind Jones and Ceiron Thomas.

Jones returned from the World Cup as first-choice, but the 2004 Six Nations Championship meant Bowen had another run in the team before the end of the season and he signed a new contract with the Scarlets in April 2004. Jones left for French side Clermont in the summer of 2004, and failed moves for New Zealander Andrew Mehrtens and France's G\u00e9rald Merceron meant Bowen was now considered the Scarlets' first-choice fly-half, although the newly signed Arwel Thomas and the young Ceiron Thomas challenged him for the starting position at various points in the 2004\u201305 season.", "In 2005\u201306, the Scarlets signed United States international Mike Hercus as competition for Bowen, limiting Bowen to just 10 starts during the season, although in October 2005, he was included as part of Wales' training squad for the 2005 Autumn internationals. The return of Stephen Jones to the Scarlets and the emergence of Ceiron Thomas saw Bowen omitted from the Scarlets' 38-man squad for the 2006\u201307 Heineken Cup; his only appearance for the region in 2006\u201307 came as a replacement in a pre-season friendly against Gloucester in August 2006, and he was limited to eight competitive appearances for Llanelli RFC before his contract was terminated in November 2006. Despite interest from Leeds Tykes, he was almost immediately signed by Neath, who were seeking a replacement at fly-half for James Hook, who had been promoted to the Ospreys regional side."]}]}}
