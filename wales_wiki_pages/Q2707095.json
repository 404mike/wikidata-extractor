A member of the House of Aberffraw, he inherited the throne from his father, Anarawd ap Rhodri. William of Malmesbury credited him as \"King of the Britons\" in the manner of his father.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edmund I", "response": ["\u00c6thelstan had succeeded as the king of England south of the Humber and he became the first king of all England when he conquered Viking-ruled York in 927, but after his death Anlaf Guthfrithson was accepted as king of York and extended Viking rule to the Five Boroughs of north-east Mercia. Edmund was initially forced to accept the reverse, the first major setback for the West Saxon dynasty since Alfred's reign, but he was able to recover his position following Anlaf's death in 941. In 942 he took back control of the Five Boroughs and in 944 he regained control over the whole of England when he expelled the Viking kings of York. Eadred had to deal with further revolts when he became king and York was not finally conquered until 954. \u00c6thelstan had achieved a dominant position over other British kings and Edmund maintained this, perhaps apart from Scotland. The north Welsh king Idwal Foel may have allied with the Vikings as he was killed by the English in 942 and his kingdom of Gwynedd was conquered by the southern Welsh king Hywel Dda. The British kingdom of Strathclyde may also have sided with the Vikings as Edmund ravaged it in 945 and then ceded it to Malcolm I of Scotland. Edmund also continued his brother's friendly relations with Continental rulers, several of whom were married to his half-sisters.", "Edmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from \u00c6thelstan, but Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, apparently took advantage of Edmund's early weakness to withhold fealty and may have supported Anlaf Guthfrithson, as according to the Annales Cambri\u00e6 he was killed by the English in 942 and his kingdom was then conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales. Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in \u00c6thelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings. Attestations became more common again after Eadred succeeded Edmund. In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"king of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title."]}, {"page": "931", "response": ["* King Morgan Hen of Glywysing and Gwent (Wales) submits to the overlordship of King \u00c6thelstan, and attends his court with Kings Hywel Dda of Deheubarth and Idwal Foel of Gwynedd."]}, {"page": "918", "response": ["* Kings Idwal Foel of Gwynedd and Hywel ap Cadell, and Prince Clydog of Deheubarth (Wales) submit to the overlordship of Edward the Elder.

His retinue also included eighteen bishops and thirteen earls, six of whom were Danes from eastern England. By late June or early July he had reached Chester-le-Street, where he made generous gifts to the tomb of St Cuthbert, including a stole and maniple (ecclesiastical garments) originally commissioned by his step-mother \u00c6lffl\u00e6d as a gift to Bishop Frithestan of Winchester. The invasion was launched by land and sea. According to the twelfth-century chronicler Simeon of Durham, his land forces ravaged as far as Dunnottar in north-east Scotland, the furthest north that any English army had reached since Ecgfrith's disastrous invasion in 685, while the fleet raided Caithness, then probably part of the Norse kingdom of Orkney.Foot, \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, pp. 87\u201388, 122\u2013123, 165\u2013167; Woolf, From Pictland to Alba, pp. 158\u2013166; Hunter Blair, An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England, p. 46", "No battles are recorded during the campaign, and chronicles do not record its outcome.

The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the Mercian Register) states that in December 918 her daughter \u00c6lfwynn \"was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex\". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 918, \"all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him\". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln. Some Danish jarls were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands. Coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in the East Midlands than in East Anglia.
