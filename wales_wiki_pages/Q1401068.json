It is more likely, however, that, as the genealogies state, he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf.  The former is more likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw describing the Mathrafal dynasty as descendants of Selyf. It was also likely, assuming Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, that Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.", "link_mentions": {}}}
