His father, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, had been king before him and his son, Gruffudd, was king after him.\nIago was King of Gwynedd from 1023 to 1039 but was killed (possibly by his own men) while Cynan was still young. The throne was seized by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, a member of a cadet branch of the royal dynasty. Cynan fled to Ireland and took refuge in the Viking settlement at Dublin. He married Ragnailt, the daughter of its King Olaf Sigtryggsson and granddaughter of King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Ragnailt appeared on the list of the \"Fair Women of Ireland\" in the Book of Leinster and was also descended from Brian Boru.\nCynan may have died fairly soon after the birth of their son Gruffudd, as the 13th-century History of Gruffydd ap Cynan details Cynan's ancestry but omits him from its account of Gruffudd's youth. Instead, Gruffudd's mother tells him about his father and the patrimony he should claim across the sea. Following two major Saxon invasions under Harold and Tostig Godwinson, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was killed in 1063: the later Welsh Brut y Tywysogion reported he was done in by his own men, while the Ulster Chronicle stated he was killed by Cynan ab Iago. This may account for later records in Gwynedd calling Cynan a king or, alternatively, it may simply have been an honorary title on account of his family. If Cynan ruled, it was very briefly, for Bleddyn ap Cynfyn was installed by the Saxons the same year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1014", "response": ["* Cynan ab Iago, king of Gwynedd (approximate date)"]}, {"page": "Echmarcach mac Ragnaill", "response": ["Exactly who \u00c6lfgar received aid from in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, \u00c6lfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord).Woolf (2007) pp. 266\u2013267; Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 152, 157; Downham (2004) p. 67; Maund (1993) p. 165. Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of \u00c6lfgar and Magn\u00fas in 1058\u2014which utilised Islesmen and Dubliners\u2014could well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well.Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 152, 157; Hudson, BT (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 154. That being said, there are several reasons to doubt a part played by Diarmait in \u00c6lfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to \u00c6lfgar's enemies\u2014the Godwinsons\u2014in the 1050s and 1060s.Downham (2018) p. 112; Wyatt (2018) p. 791 n. 196; Barlow (2013) pp. 58, 165\u2013166, 168\u2013169; Wyatt (2009) p. 385, 385 n. 196; Downham (2004) pp. 66\u201367; Hudson, BT (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 155; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 348\u2013349. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago, a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of \u00c6lfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 151; Downham (2004) p. 67; Etchingham (2001) p. 155; DeVries (1999) p. 143 n. 66; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 340\u2013344, 348."]}, {"page": "Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig", "response": ["Very little is known about the reign of Iago.
