Proksa struggled early on with Booth's jab, height and reach. He was rocked by a right hand over the top which caught him on the temple in the second round, though he showed great resolve and soon enough his superior work rate and movement started to pay dividends. He was readily catching Booth to the body and coming in throwing strong combinations. Proksa's punch output was just too much for Booth and having dropped him in the fifth-round, referee Giuseppe Quartarone decided to call a halt to the bout, thus giving Proksa the vacant title. Speaking after the fight, Proksa mentioned the shot which Booth had caught im with in round-two: \"For half a minute after that blow, I heard nothing, it was ringing in my head [...] I was surprised by this blow, I don't know how it hit me. Then I wanted to kill him.\""]}]}}
