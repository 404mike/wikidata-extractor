Martel initially received some criticism from Brazilian press for failing to consult with Scliar. Martel pointed out that he could not have stolen from a work he had not at the time read, and he willingly acknowledged being influenced by the New York Times review of Scliar's work and thanked him in the Author's Note of Life of Pi.Hemminger, Peter (13 March, 2106).

Each story in the collection stars different characters, and all deal with the themes of eroticism, destruction, power, and loss. Dead Girls is Lee's debut novel and draws its inspiration from the missing women of Vancouver between 1978 and 2001.", "While each of the stories in Nancy Lee's breakout novel are varied in subject matter, they are united by themes of eroticism, destruction, loss, and the recurring image of the missing and murdered women of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. The images of these women are subtly inserted into each story via television screens, or comments about jury duty.", "As a favour for her friend Janet, a drug-addicted nurse supervises a high-school dance-a-thon that aims to raise money for a drug awareness program. The story follows the nurse throughout the night: she greets the students\u2019 parents, imagines an affair with Janet's husband, Paul, and she has an affair with one of the students. Nancy Lee has stated that she conducted research on pharmaceutical addiction in the medical profession in order to inform the story, and that the drug-addicted nurse is an example of how people often spend their lives trying to hide something.", "Dead Girls has received widespread acclaim from critics, with many citing its well-written prose and subtle examination of its subject matter being particularly strong characteristics. In his review for The Guardian, Colin Greenland writes, \"Graceful and wintry, Nancy Lee's stories describe with beautiful, desolate precision a society that is itself dismembered, riven by loss and hunger.\""]}]}}
