He played 422 first-class matches, all of them for Glamorgan.\nHe played most of his cricket as an opening batsman despite starting his career in the middle order. He scored 17,733 first-class runs at an average of 25.22, with 21 centuries and a highest score of 182. His best season was 1961, when he scored 2026 runs at an average of 32.15.\nHedges was the first player to score a List A century for Glamorgan, doing so in 1963 with an innings of 103 against Somerset, helping Glamorgan to victory in its first List A match.He died at his home on 8 February 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Bernard Hedges || 17,733"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Parkhouse", "response": ["In fact, the 1951 season set the pattern for the next eight seasons of Parkhouse's career. In each season from 1951 to 1958, he made his 1000 runs for the year, but he never made more than two centuries in a season, and in 1952 and 1958 he made none at all. His batting average in most of these seasons was around 30, with 1642 runs at 35.69 in 1957 the best year, and 1126 at 24.47 in 1958 the worst. From 1953 he went back to opening the innings, initially, with Emrys Davies, then with Clift or captain Wilf Wooller, finally forming a regular partnership with Bernard Hedges. In 1954, he raised his own highest score with an innings of 182 against Middlesex at Lord's. And two years later, in 1956, he raised it again, to 201, in the match against Kent at Swansea."]}, {"page": "Hedges (surname)", "response": ["* Bernard Hedges (1927\u20132014), Welsh cricketer"]}, {"page": "Pontypridd High School", "response": ["* Bernard Hedges, professional cricketer with Glamorgan CCC, 1950-1967"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bernard Hedges (1950\u20131967) : B.
