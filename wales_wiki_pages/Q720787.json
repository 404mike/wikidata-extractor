David Langford described how the book was prepared from a computer analysis of a discovered \"cipher text\" by Dr. John Dee. The resulting \"translation\" was in fact written by occultist Robert Turner, but it was far truer to the Lovecraftian version than the Simon text and even incorporated quotations from Lovecraft's stories in its passages. Wilson also wrote a story, \"The Return of the Lloigor\", in which the Voynich manuscript turns out to be a copy of the Necronomicon."]}, {"page": "Robert A. Heinlein", "response": ["After a seven-year hiatus brought on by poor health, Heinlein produced five new novels in the period from 1980 (The Number of the Beast) to 1987 (To Sail Beyond the Sunset). These books have a thread of common characters and time and place. They most explicitly communicated Heinlein's philosophies and beliefs, and many long, didactic passages of dialog and exposition deal with government, sex, and religion. These novels are controversial among his readers and one critic, David Langford, has written about them very negatively.See, e.g., Review of Vulgarity and Nullity  by Dave Langford.

One of the best known fanzines today is Ansible, edited by David Langford, winner of numerous Hugo awards. Other notable fanzines to win one or more Hugo awards include File 770, Mimosa, and Plokta.
