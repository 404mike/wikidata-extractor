This was not an incumbency: the vicar of St Alkmund's throughout Herring's time in Shrewsbury was Thomas Lloyd, who had been appointed in 1607.Owen and Blakeway, p. 279. Lloyd was held in no great regard as a preacher and was paid \u00a35 to read Morning Prayer.Coulton, p. 78. Herring's lectureship did not require an oath before the bishop, as it was privately funded by a \u00a320 annuity. This was provided by Rowland Heylyn, a merchant of Welsh ancestry, educated at Shrewsbury School and a former parishioner of St Alkmund's, who had become immensely wealthy and powerful in the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers in London. Heylyn had two sisters living in Shrewsbury, Ann and Eleanor, who were married respectively to John Nicholls and Richard Hunt, powerful local politicians who were associates of William Rowley, described by Clarke as \"a wise religious man.\"Clarke, p. 464. It was Rowley who made the initial approach to Herring and acted throughout as his \"faithful friend.\" It seems that he initially accommodated the Herring family in his own mansion. Rowley was a member of Shrewsbury's powerful Drapers' Company and Hunt was its warden.Coulton, p. 79. The company's hall was vacant and it was probably they who prevailed on the members to lease it to Herring for \u00a34 annually, the company reserving the right to use it for meetings but agreeing to pay for repairs.Owen and Blakeway, p. 279-80, note 4."]}]}}
