While he probably wrote more fiction about the industrial world of the South Wales Valleys than anyone else, Rhys Davies was in fact a grocer's son who was living in London by the time he was twenty. Unlike that of other writers from the mining community, his fiction is more concerned with individuals, in particular women, than with politics.A Hundred Years of Fiction, p.64. D. H. Lawrence was a major influence on Rhys, though similarities with Caradoc Evans have been noted, and it has been suggested that he had \"The tendency to process images of the Welsh valleys for consumption by English audiences\".A Pocket Guide, p.104. Another Anglo-Welsh novelist (and playwright) was Jack Jones (1884\u20131970), a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897\u20131939) largely autobiographical novel."]}, {"page": "Jack Jones", "response": ["Jack Jones may refer to:", "*Jack Jones (American singer) (born 1938), American jazz and pop singer", "*Jack Jones, stage name of Australian singer Irwin Thomas (born 1971)", "*Jack Jones (Welsh musician) (born 1992), Welsh musician, songwriter and poet", "*Jack Jones (novelist) (1884\u20131970), Welsh novelist and playwright", "*Jack Jones (journalist) (1924\u20132011), American journalist", "*Jack Jones (TV journalist) (1949\u20131991), American television journalist", "*Lance-Corporal Jack Jones, a character in the sitcom Dad's Army", "*Jack Jones, a banker in the Oliver Stone film Nixon", "*Jack Jones (Silvertown MP) (John Joseph Jones, 1873\u20131941), British Labour MP for Silvertown", "*Jack Jones (Rotherham MP) (John Henry Jones, 1894\u20131962), British Labour MP for Bolton, later MP for Rotherham", "*Jack Jones (Australian politician) (John Joseph Jones, 1907\u20131997), member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Ballarat", "*Jack Jones (trade unionist) (1913\u20132009), British trade union leader", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1869) (1866\u20131931), Wales international footballer who played for Grimsby Town, Sheffield United and Tottenham", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1874) (1874\u20131904), English football forward for Small Heath, Bristol Rovers and Tottenham ", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u20131948), English football defender for Birmingham, Nelson and Crewe", "*Jack Jones (1920s Welsh footballer), footballer for Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1907), Irish football defender for Linfield, Hibernian, Glenavon, Bath City and Ireland (IFA)", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u20131995), English football player for Everton and Sunderland", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1916) (1916\u20131999), Scottish footballer", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20132001), Welsh footballer for Wrexham, Doncaster Rovers and New Brighton", "*Jack Jones (soccer, born 1987) (born 1987), American soccer player", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u20131964), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1888) (1888\u20131960), Australian rules footballer for University", "*Jack Jones (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20132020), Australian rules footballer for Essendon", "*Jack Jones (rugby union, born 1886) (1886\u20131951), Welsh international rugby union player", "*Jack Jones (rugby, born 1890) (1890\u2013?), rugby union and league footballer for Wales (RU), Abertillery, and Oldham (RL)", "*Jack Jones (Australian rugby league) (fl. 1925\u20131933), Australian rugby league player", "*Jumping Jack Jones (1860\u20131936), American baseball pitcher", "*Jack Jones (cricketer) (1899\u20131991), cricketer for Western Australia and Australian rules football player and coach", "*Jack Jones (water polo) (1925\u20132016), English Olympic water polo player"]}, {"page": "Rhiwbina", "response": ["Rhiwbina has been the home of many noted Welsh artists including the authors Jack Jones and Kate Roberts, musician Howard Jones, dramatist Tom Richards and the actress Rachel Thomas, who worked together.", "*Jack Jones, (1884\u20131970), novelist, lived in Rhiwbina in the 1920s."]}, {"page": "Joseph Parry", "response": ["In 1947, another son of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, Off to Philadelphia in the Morning , on the events in the life of Joseph Parry.

Lewis Jones (1897\u20131939), and Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999), and poet Idris Davies (1905\u201353). Jack Jones was a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897\u20131939) largely autobiographical novel. Gwyn Thomas (1913\u201381) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905\u201353), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh \"but rebellion against chapel religion\", along with the \"inspirational influence of English\" poets, led him to write in English. Gwalia Deserta (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of The Angry Summer (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. Rhys Davies, author of A Time To Laugh (1937), and Menna Gallie, author of Strike for a Kingdom (1959) and The Small Mine (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of South Wales. Harold Heslop, author of the novel The Earth Beneath (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of England, as was Sid Chaplin, who wrote The Thin Seam (1949)."]}, {"page": "Thomas Rowland Hughes", "response": ["From 1935 to 1945, Hughes was a producer of feature programmes for the BBC in Cardiff.
