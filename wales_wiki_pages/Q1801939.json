A new generation emerged, with the events attracting individuals from many disciplines such as field athletics, weightlifting and powerlifting. These competitions fed other international competitions such as Europe's Strongest Man and World's Strongest Man. Household names, such as Geoff Capes, Jamie Reeves and Gary Taylor dominated, with these three in particular going on to win World's Strongest Man titles. The modern era has seen this trend continue with Terry Hollands, Mark Felix and Laurence Shahlaei being regular faces at World's Strongest Man and its associated Super Series. Featured events in these contests have been tailored to emphasize a more well-rounded athlete, to reflect that viewpoint on strongman as a whole, and in the interests of increased popularity and marketability among the masses. Almost inevitably, more than one interested party has seen the benefits of strength competitions. Alternative organizations have formed in recent years, comprising a new wave of influence in the field, with the United Kingdom Strength Council (UKSC) founded by Britain's Strongest Man multi-year champion Glenn Ross setting up events separate from BSM, as has the IFSA. Ross and his UK Strongest Man competitions hold a philosophical difference in approach with the World's Strongest Man related venues, including more brute strength events similar to traditional strongman and powerlifting, with less emphasis on field athleticism and endurance.", "|  Gary Taylor", "| Gary TaylorBill PittuckForbes Cowan", "| Forbes CowanGary Taylor", "| Gary Taylor", "| Gary TaylorJamie Reeves", "|  Gary Taylor", "| Gary Taylor", "|1996 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1995 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1997 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1996 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1995 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1994 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1993 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1991 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1990 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1989 ||  Gary Taylor ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC"]}, {"page": "List of British bodybuilders", "response": ["*Gary Taylor"]}, {"page": "World Muscle Power Classic", "response": ["|1995 ||  Magn\u00fas Ver Magn\u00fasson || / Forbes Cowen ||  / Gary Taylor ||  "]}, {"page": "1995 World's Strongest Man", "response": ["| 1. || Gary Taylor ||  || 12.5", "| Gary Taylor"]}, {"page": "1994 World's Strongest Man", "response": ["The 1994 World's Strongest Man was the 17th edition of World's Strongest Man and was won by Magnus Ver Magnusson from Iceland.
