He achieved a personal best ranking of 39th on the Order or Merit in 1974, but did not win any tournaments in this period. After a spell as a club professional at Craythorne Golf Centre (1975\u201378), Royal Malta Golf Club (1978\u201381) and Thirsk and Northallerton Golf Club (1982\u201384), he returned to tournament golf in 1984, and collected several tournament victories during the following years. His sole win on the main European Tour was the 1988 AGF Biarritz Open, when he set a tour record four round total of 258. The scoring record was tied by Llewellyn's countryman Ian Woosnam in 1990 and not beaten until more than 32 years later, when Andy Sullivan scored 257 at the 2020 English Championship.\nLlewellyn also won the 1987 Vernon's tournament in Merseyside, on the informal European satellite tour which existed before the official Challenge Tour was founded, and the 1991 Ivory Coast Open, which was a Challenge Tour event. However the highlight of his career was perhaps winning the World Cup of Golf for Wales alongside Ian Woosnam in 1987.\nLlewellyn left the tour for a second time in the early 1990s to return to being a club professional. He later became National Coach to the Golf Union of Wales between 2002 and 2007.", "link_mentions": {}}}
