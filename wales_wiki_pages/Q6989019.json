McPherson played club rugby for Newport and captained the team in the 1921/22 season.\nMcPherson gained his first cap for Scotland in 1920 against Wales at Inverleith alongside teammate Dr E Fahmy, who also played his club rugby in Wales. Scotland won 9-5, and prevented Wales from winning the Grand Slam. After accepting a gold watch as part of Newport's invincible 1922/23 season, the Scottish Rugby Union suspended McPherson for what they saw as an act of professionalism; but he was later re-instated. McPherson's last game for Scotland was against Ireland, but was chosen to join the British Lions 1924 tour of South Africa, when he played in all four tests against the Springboks.\nInternational matches played\nScotland\n\n England 1920, 1921, 1923\n France 1921\n Ireland 1920, 1923\n Wales 1920British Lions\n\n South Africa 1924, 1924, 1924, 1924", "link_mentions": {}}}
