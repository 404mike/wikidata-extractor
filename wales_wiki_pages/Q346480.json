The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang. In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet. In Paul Stenning's book AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's bitter feeling toward Evans.", "In September 1974, Bon Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young.

They came through Adelaide with the Lou Reed and Stevie Wright tour, and played their own show at the Pooraka Hotel... The first time I saw AC/DC was at the Pooraka Hotel in September. 'Get up there, Bon,' Vince kept saying. The band didn't have a singer that night; they were playing instrumental versions of old rock 'n' roll standards. The boys ripped through all these classic numbers and then finally, with enough pressure from Vince, Bon climbed onto the stage. I didn't realise that AC/DC had just sacked Dave Evans and they wanted Bon to replace him.

(album)", "response": ["T.N.T. contains some of the band's best-known songs, including the title track, \"It's a Long Way to the Top\", \"The Jack\", and \"Rocker.\" Seven of the album's nine songs were written by the Young brothers and Scott, while \"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\" predated Scott's involvement in the band, having been recorded as a single with former vocalist Dave Evans.  It features a different arrangement and slightly different lyrics from the original version. It also runs almost a minute longer. \"School Days\" is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song, a major influence on both Young brothers. \"High Voltage\" was the first song written and recorded for the album, the title inspired by that of the previous album.  In 1993, Angus Young shared the origins of the title track with Vic Garbarini of Guitar For the Practicing Musician: \"I remember sitting home one night before going into the studio and playing around with some chords, and I suddenly thought, let's try playing...A...C...D...C. Sounded good. And then I thought AC/DC...power...\"High Voltage\"! I sang the chorus part to my brother in the studio and he thought it sounded great.\" Issued as the first single before the T.N.T. sessions began, many fans thought it was from High Voltage. Chris Gilbey of Albert Productions later claimed this caused a late surge in that album's sales. Lyrically, the LP features Bon Scott chronicling both the good and the bad about the rock and roll lifestyle, warning aspiring musicians that \"it's harder than it looks\" (\"It's a Long Way to the Top\") but also defiantly telling the moral majority to \"stick your moral standards 'cause it's all a dirty lie\" (\"Rock 'n' Roll Singer\"). In 1994, biographer Clifton Walker observed that Bon was \"virtually encapsulating his entire life\" in both songs. The lyrics of \"The Jack,\" sometimes titled \"(She's Got) The Jack,\" were developed by Scott, who was inspired by a letter Malcolm Young received during a tour of Adelaide. The letter, from a woman in Melbourne, implied that Malcolm had given her a venereal disease, although he claims that when he got tested, he was clean. Scott's original lyrics were far more explicit than those heard on the album, which he deliberately toned down in case the song got played on radio. The bravado-driven \"Live Wire,\" which was also sexually suggestive, would be the band's show-opener for several years. Almost right from the beginning, the band was taken to task in some quarters for their \"smutty\" lyrics, as Angus acknowledged to Guitar Worlds Tom Beaujour in 1998:"]}, {"page": "Dan Ar Braz", "response": ["Braz released a collegian album of Irish jigs and reels in 1979, entitled Irish Reels, Jigs, Hornpipes and Airs with a band featuring Davey Graham, Dave Evans, and Duck Baker.

In 1981, he toured Europe promoting his album Acoustic, a subdued collection of instrumentals, written by himself. He then joined a blues-rock trio. Between 1984 and 1987, he toured the United States over a dozen times. By the time he recorded Musiques pour les silences \u00e0 venir (Music for the Silences to Come) in 1985, he was being described as \"New Age\".
