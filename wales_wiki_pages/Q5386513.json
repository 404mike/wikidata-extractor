At Mathern, Tipping noted that:  What remained of the old palace, after the lead had been stripped from the greater part of its roofs, and its interior woodwork and fittings had been destroyed or removed, [had been] turned into a farmhouse.  The gatehouse, banqueting hall, and other now useless buildings provided material for barn and cowshed.  The chapel was converted into a dairy, the kitchen into a stable.  Tipping decided to restore the buildings as a home for himself and his ageing mother, drawing explicitly on the guidelines on restoring old buildings that had been drawn up by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB).  By 1899 Tipping had restored and enlarged the house.  He also laid out a new and largely informal garden around the buildings, in the Arts and Crafts style influenced by the writings of William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll.  An article by Tipping in Country Life magazine in 1910 set out his approach in detail, including his protection of architectural features.  According to the architectural writer John Newman, \"Tipping wove in his own contributions with... tact and restraint\"; Tipping's biographer states that he \"transformed it into an unpretentious, romantic country home set in a delightful garden\"."]}, {"page": "High Glanau", "response": ["The house was built in the Arts and Crafts style in 1922\u201323 by the architect Eric Francis, of Chepstow, for Henry Avray Tipping.
