She discovered a method for identifying varieties of crop resistant to these fungal diseases and proved that methods such as crop rotation only perpetuated the problem. Her research led to increased yields in agriculture, which was of particular note during World War II, and was appointed an OBE for her services to agriculture. \nGlynne was also a passionate mountaineer, climbing a number of famous Alpine peaks. She was the second person, the first woman, to climb Mount Spencer in New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rothamsted Research", "response": ["*Mary Dilys Glynne (plant pathologist)"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Arthur Smith", "response": ["Smith was interested in reptiles and amphibians from an early age.
