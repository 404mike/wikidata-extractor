One judge scored the fight 114-114, whilst the remaining two judges scored the fight 117-111 and 116-112 in favour of Smith, giving him the majority decision. Smith started the fight slow and less aggressive than usual, making the first half of the fight close. Smith did well to cut the ring off when needed and utilised his jab. Williams seemed to land the harder shots, but had a lower output than Smith. With the win, Smith became the mandatory challenger to Miguel Cotto's WBO light middleweight title. Warren confirmed that regardless of Cotto's situation, whether he retires or vacates, Smith's next fight in 2018 would be for the WBO title. The next highest ranked contender at the time was Magomed Kurbonov. Smith said in the post-fight interviews, \"It was a different fight this time -- I think I showed a different Liam Smith. I think people were surprised how I boxed him. I've just beat a very good boxer in Liam Williams. Some people think I just walk forward, but I showed I've got a very good jab.\" The next day, Williams stated that he would like to fight Smith for a third time.
