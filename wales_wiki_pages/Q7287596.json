They came about because both Hood and Todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex's beauty; in particular, Hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house. Originally, the gardens were supposed to be all interconnected via bridges between the roofs of each building. However, after Hood's death in 1935, the garden plan fell apart, as most of the complex's final buildings were built without provisions for gardens. The Associated Press Building's 15th-story roof, as well as the isolated location of the International Building and the high cost of these gardens, made this system infeasible. Ultimately, gardens were installed on 10 Rockefeller Plaza; 30 Rockefeller Plaza; the four International-themed retail buildings; the Center Theatre; and Radio City Music Hall. The gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 due to various expenses as well as a lack of interest among tourists."]}, {"page": "Green roof", "response": ["*Ralph Hancock, designer, The Rockefeller Center Roof Gardens"]}, {"page": "Gertrude Jekyll", "response": ["* Ralph Hancock (landscape gardener)"]}, {"page": "Roof garden", "response": ["*Ralph Hancock, designer of The Rockefeller Center Roof Gardens"]}, {"page": "Kensington Roof Gardens", "response": ["Derry and Toms new Art Deco department store was opened in 1933.
