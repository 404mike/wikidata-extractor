However Glamorgan openers Jones and Hopkins made much better work of it the second time around, pushing the score past 100 without loss. With Australia's frontline bowlers struggling to make a breakthrough, spinner Ray Bright was brought on, and made an immediate impact, having the advancing Hopkins stumped brilliantly by replacement wicket-keeper Richie Robinson for 66. Bright troubled the Glamorgan batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and soon claimed another, Arthur Francis for 2, leaving Glamorgan on 119\u20132. Gwyn Richards arrived as his replacement and tried to lift the scoring, but Bright soon claimed Jones for 47, and Mike Llewellyn for 9. Glamorgan had reached 164 for 4 off 43 overs and decided to end their innings and give the Australian's a competitive target. Bright finished with 4 for 53."]}, {"page": "Paul Roberts (cricketer)", "response": ["After this performance, Roberts was immediately called up to the first team for the John Player League game against Surrey. He took 2-32 (including the wicket of Geoff Howarth) from his eight overs in a match curtailed by the weather (Worcestershire were adjudged the winners on run rate), and was picked to play against Glamorgan in the County Championship at the end of the month.
