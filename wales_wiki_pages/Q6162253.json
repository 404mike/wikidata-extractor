Proksa struggled early on with Booth's jab, height and reach. He was rocked by a right hand over the top which caught him on the temple in the second round, though he showed great resolve and soon enough his superior work rate and movement started to pay dividends. He was readily catching Booth to the body and coming in throwing strong combinations.

Then I wanted to kill him.\""]}]}}
