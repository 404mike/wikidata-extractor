He was the 1978 World Amateur Champion and won the 1991 World Seniors Championship. He was a successful junior player, known for his fast attacking snooker and potting ability, and won the British Under-19 Championship in 1951 and 1952. In the early 1950s both Wilson and future six-times World Professional Champion Ray Reardon lived in Tredegar, where they played a succession of money matches that attracted large enthusiastic crowds.\nA combination of factors, including Reardon leaving Tredegar, led to Wilson virtually giving up the game from 1957 to 1972, but after being asked to take up a vacant place in a works team, he returned to playing and later became the 1978 World Amateur Champion, achieving his victory with an 11\u20135 win in the final against Joe Johnson. In 1979 Wilson turned professional, aged 45, and, still playing with an attacking style, reached several ranking tournament quarter-finals during his career. At the inaugural World Seniors Championship in 1991 he beat Eddie Charlton 5\u20134 in the final to take the title. He won the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1956, 1977 and 1979, and was runner-up in the Welsh Professional Championship in 1981 and 1984. He suffered from a number of health conditions, including poor eyesight, during his career, but continued to play professionally until his death in 1994 at the age of 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Cliff Wilson (1934\u20131994)"]}, {"page": "Joe Johnson (snooker player)", "response": ["Johnson was National Under-19 champion in 1971 and three times Yorkshire Champion. He was runner-up to Terry Griffiths in the English Amateur championship of 1978 and, with Griffiths being a Welshman, Johnson qualified as England's representative in that year's World Amateur in Malta. He gave a very good account of himself and reached the final where he lost to Cliff Wilson. This prompted Johnson to turn professional in 1979.", "In Johnson's first season as a professional he was unranked. Johnson turned professional alongside other notable players of the future, including Tony Meo, Mike Hallett and Cliff Wilson. Johnson's first match as a professional came in the non-ranking 1979 Canadian Open. In Round 1 he beat Steve Baruda 5\u20134. The match included a break of 100, Johnson's first century break as a professional. In the second round Johnson beat John Bear 9\u20137 and then lost in the last 16 to Kirk Stevens by 9 frames to 2. In the next event, the 1979 UK Championship, Johnson lost his opening match, a last 24 encounter with Bill Werbeniuk by 9 frames to 3. At the 1980 British Gold Cup, Johnson had Willie Thorne and Ray Edmonds in his qualifying group. Johnson lost 3\u20130 to Thorne but beat Edmonds 2\u20131, which was not enough for Johnson to qualify out of his group. At the 1980 World Championship Johnson beat Roy Andrewartha 9\u20135 in Round 1 and progressed to the last 48 where Johnson lost 9\u20136 to Pat Houlihan. Johson won just \u00a3100 in his first professional season, received no ranking points and he finished the season unranked.", "Johnson started the season unranked. His first event was the 1981 International Open in which he beat Jim Donnelly 5\u20134 in Round 1, Murdo MacLeod 5\u20131 in Round 2 and received a walkover against John Pulman in Round 3. In Round 4 Johnson beat Jim Wych 5\u20133 and then lost in Round 5, the last 32, 5\u20133 to Graham Miles. In the 1981 UK Championship Johnson began the event with a comprehensive 9\u20131 win over Tommy Murphy in Round 2. This was followed by a Round 3 9\u20133 defeat of Mike Watterson and in Round 4 a 9\u20134 win over Cliff Wilson. In round 5 Johnson beat the former three-time world champion John Spencer 9\u20135 and this earned Johnson a last 16 appearance at the UK Championship against another former world champion, Ray Reardon, to whom Johnson narrowly lost 9\u20137. At the 1982 International Masters, Johnson began the event in the pre-qualifying group stage with a 2\u20131 loss against Dave Martin, and 2\u20130 wins over both Geoff Foulds and Cliff Wilson. The results were enough to take Johnson into the next qualifying round where he lost 2\u20131 to John Virgo, but beat John Spencer 2\u20131 and Dave Martin (again) 2\u20130. In the third and final group stage Johnson lost 2\u20130 to Dennis Taylor and Reardon but beat Virgo 2\u20131, but the win was not enough to take Johnson out of the group stage. In Round 1 of the 1982 World Championship Johnson beat Vic Harris 9\u20134 and reached the last 48, where he lost 9\u20138. After a 2\u20130 Round 1 defeat by Jackie Rea in the 1982 Bass and Golden Leisure Classic Johnson ended the season with no ranking points, \u00a32,950 prize money \u2013 25th in the money list, but was again unranked.", "Johnson started the season unranked and in his first match he received a walkover against John Phillips in Round 1 of the 1982 International Open. Johnson lost his last 48 match against Cliff Wilson 5\u20134. In the last 32 of the 1982 Professional Players Tournament Johnson began with a solid 5\u20131 last 64 win against Graham Miles and a last 32 5\u20131 win against Kirk Stevens. Johnson followed this up with a 5\u20134 last 16 win over Mark Wildman and in the quarter final Johnson was beaten 5\u20131 by John Virgo, a result which earned Johnson his first ranking points. Johnson started the 1982 UK championship with a narrow 9\u20138 victory over Vic Harris in the last 48 before being comprehensively beaten 9\u20131 by Terry Griffiths in the last 32. At the 1983 International Masters, Johnson again started in pre-qualifying and he scored 2\u20130 victories over Murdo Macleod and Mario Morra, but lost his following two matches 2\u20130 to Willie Thorne and Tony Meo. In qualifying for the 1983 World Championship Johnson scored a 10\u20130 whitewash over Paul Watchorn in Round 1 but lost 9\u20138 to Cliff Wilson and thus failed to reach the main event at the Crucible Theatre. Johnson won \u00a34,650 in prize money over the season and received 2 ranking points.", "Johnson started the 1984/85 season ranked 19th in the World. At the 1984 Costa Del Sol Classic Johnson made a 105 break in his 3\u20131 quarter final win over Mick Fisher and then lost 3\u20132 in the semi final to Dennis Taylor. At the 1984 International Open Ranking event, Johnson beat Mario Morra 5\u20130 in the last 48 and Eddie Charlton 5\u20131 in the last 32 before losing again to Dennis Taylor, this time 5\u20132 in the last 16. In the following ranking event, the 1984 Grand Prix Johnson beat Paul Medati 5\u20131 in the last 64 but then lost 5\u20134 to Ian Williamson last 32.> At the 1984 UK Championship Johnson beat John Rea 9\u20136 in the last 48 and John Spencer by the same scoreline in the last 32. In the last 16 Kirk Stevens beat Johnson 9\u20132. In the 1985 Mercantile Credit ranking event Johnson reached the semi-final with a last 48 5\u20134 win over Ray Edmonds, a 5\u20131 last 32 win over Tony Knowles and a 5\u20130 whitewash of Cliff Wilson in the last 16 and a 5\u20131 win over Warren King in the quarter final.
