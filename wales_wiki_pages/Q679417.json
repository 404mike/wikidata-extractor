Here, the English attacked and routed the Welsh forces. Adam of Usk\u2019s contemporary description gives a vivid picture of the attacks on the retreating Welsh: \u201cthere slew with fire and the edge of the sword many of them, and above all the Abbot of Llanthony, and they crushed them without ceasing, driving them through the monk's wood, where the said Griffin (Owain's son) was taken.\u201dBattles and Campaigns from The Chronicle of Adam of Usk ", "According to the Scottish chronicler Walter Bower, Dafydd Gam, a committed enemy of the rebellion, a Welshman originally from Brecon but holding land at Llantilio Crossenny, Monmouthshire, played a significant part in the English victory. Gam's local knowledge and reputation might very well have been vital.

Whether this strengthening represented a standard precautionary move considering the ongoing revolt or whether they had specific advance warning is uncertain, but to inflict such a heavy defeat on a large attacking force, their numbers probably were considerable and it seems that Gruffudd had no inkling of the strength of the numbers he faced inside Usk castle. It is perhaps significant that just two years earlier in 1403, Owain Glynd\u0175r had burnt the town of Usk to the ground, with loss of life and property so local people may not have favoured his cause. The presence of such English leaders as Grey and Greyndor combined with men with excellent local knowledge and reputations as Dafydd Gam and John Oldcastle at the exact time of a Welsh attack does seem indicative if not conclusive of there being foreknowledge."]}, {"page": "1410s in England", "response": ["** Owain Glynd\u0175r cuts through the King's men and captures, later ransoming, a leading Welsh supporter of King Henry's, Dafydd Gam, in an ambush in Brecon.
